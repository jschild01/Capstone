[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000] Take a trip on the canal.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000] I knew it can now.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.440] You may talk about your place, your trip's on the Great Lakes, but a trip's on this
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.440] global, your back takes a gig.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.600] These take yous to a further finding doctorate, and the fly's at my tag with that
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600] cup on the deck.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.080] The potatoes, she'll burn with their coffee, boil or let your nail make chalk and so breezy
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.080] the floor.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.080] Their cup rooms are lima, tumas, d'y, d'y, and when it's all over you left to you cry.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.840] So all in the tall line, I'm take up the slide.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040] Take a refill your shirt, take a rest, and your back.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.360] Whatever you do, be sure to don't forget.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.000] Tap the news gently while the cook is on deck.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.720] She knew just what did I do put the line on, but fit locks and dressing the stairs
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.880] when the song, because dear honey, aiding was off that mistake.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.120] Was there with the goods if you wanted things quick?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.400] She got a risk at that desk and send her on not the flight, which up was a call from the
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400] boat to the bay.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.080] Well, the like ain't ya, lazy, whatever may come.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.640] Take it to the fun, like now, if you want to have fun.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.560] We had a few mascots, a source of delight, at the locks for her chickens with others
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560] would fight.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.400] The pigs they would scream, but the quick can get.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.920] The pigeons would cooch other colors and with.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.080] All along we were welcome, a show, was in spring, and at night we had music with play
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.360] you don't sing.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.040] My mind wanders back to the different versions.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.960] No place in the world has such oceans of fun.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.360] Our muse they were pecked, the you should see them, friends.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.360] They hardwaters, they could wish for a dance.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800] They knew did their stuff, or I say they were trained.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.280] They've voice of the drivers to them, I'm refrain.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.760] Our leader was wise for him, do many things.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.360] He kept up the line while the cooks she would sing.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.720] So all work together, whatever may come.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.960] Take it to the fun, the knall, if you want to have fun.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.800] The cooks she's at days, she's dead gone on me.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.560] She's firey and heavy, this sweet 43.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.840] The captain of the bells and the driver, yes, all.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840] Guess what?
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.240] Look at her and they backward would fall.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.560] Her mind it just gone for she gave it away.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.160] I'm how many pieces she gave me each day.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.520] She's blinded and seven, she leed on from the pet.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.560] We used her for a headlight at night on the deck.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.680] We were a rough and ready, would meet anything.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.960] It was work from the play, we were desiowed those things.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.240] No doubt we were clenish, but that's not a fault.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.680] The town just got funny, we did call her home.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.880] We met a position aboard and that home.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.560] The knallers were famous for holding their own.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.920] We lived our own life, was a gasey one.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.240] They give their fun the knallers, you want to have fun.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.600] So hauling the toll, I'm take up the slack.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.240] They go, re-bin your shirt, they're less draped in your bag.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.960] Whatever you do, be sure don't forget.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.160] Have the musically well cooked here's on day.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.240] Your name please.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.920] PR9.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.480] Yeah, 8.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.720] 67.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960] I can't hide.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.480] Where did you get this song, Captain?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.480] I made this song, wrote this all of 15 years ago and more.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.760] But the copy run the knallers, finally got the other knallers also.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760] Did you hear me?
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.920] The ear is knall, yes, sir.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.520] I heard my brothers hit over there.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520] I'm trying.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.720] I'm trying with a song.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.400] We're going to come out like Gary.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.720] The season is dry, old timer.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.720] Yes, and water won't run up hill.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.160] So let's do our best and forget the rest.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.760] On key, far-levels filled, so.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.840] We're going to come out the gerry.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.080] We're going to begin the soon.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.680] And when you get done, you can tell me the sun of the whiskers on the moon.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.960] For the knall needs a water to keep us all afloat.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.480] Then I never would put wheels on a grand old boat.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.720] For I love the old top-house and all that, things are flowing.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.400] So you cannot make a wagon of my old knall, boow.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.400] The porous legs of stint sailors are feeder summons get low.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.000] Or then, for rain, you'd have to wait for load of weekend, not go.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.040] We were watcharkey, centettles.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.360] Yes, the tumbles and waves went to.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.560] They would help us along with their merry song.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.480] And we'll see that way, get through.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.320] So we're going to pop out like Gary.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.800] We're going to begin next year.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.920] And when we get done, you can tell me the sun of the whiskers on the moon.
