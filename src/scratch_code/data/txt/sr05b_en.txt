[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000] That's what I was talking about.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000] The fucking mistake.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000] All right.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000] That's where the came in was a star, a friend.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000] The second of I let's lose.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000] The third came in was Lord Jennifer's wife
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000] who spies the young man grew.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000] How can you play with Sergeant Man?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000] How can you play with dying?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000] Oh come and drive with me.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000] These people, my Lord, has gone from home.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000] To drive with you, I dare not do.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000] I dare not for my life.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000] For I know by the ring that you wear on your finger,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000] you are Lord Bennett for twice.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000] What if I am Lord Bennett for twice?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000] The Lord has gone from home.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000] He's gone to seek for Henry King George's own,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000] his throne.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000] One of Lord Bennett for servant men,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000] who overheard it all.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000] He ran to Lee came to the river side,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000] then lead the dead and swim.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000] He swam till he came to the other side,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000] and lead the out and ran.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000] He ran to Lee came to King George's gate.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000] He rattled Lee, rattled and rang.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000] None of your rattling or none of your reign,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000] nor none of your casting down.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000] For the mcruers dining with Lord Bennett for twice,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000] in a fair Scottish town,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000] rise up, rise up my servant men,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000] and go along with me.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000] We must go see this fair couple,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000] as happy couple to see.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000] If this be a lie, my servant said he,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000] as I suppose it to be,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000] I'll have a gal of six for you,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000] and hang in you shall be.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000] If this be a lie, my Lord said he,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000] as you suppose it to be,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000] you need not fix a gal of four me,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000] but hang me on a tree.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000] If this be true, my servant said he,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000] as you were telling me,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000] I'll make you rise with all my land,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000] and all my liberty.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000] One of Lord Bennett for his men servants, then.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000] Who showed my green O'ell,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000] he picked it up the view,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000] go and blue both loud and thrilled.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000] O'Hark, O'Hark, my lad said he,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000] the crops are growing for day,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000] and he is facing with another man's wife,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000] let him be getting away.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000] Oh, no, oh, no, my dear said she,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000] the crops are not growing for day,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000] it's only my father's shepherd boy's
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000] adriving his sheep away.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000] Then they died and wind again till at last they both fell asleep,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000] and before they had time to rise again,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000] Lord Bennett for still their feet.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000] O'Hark, O'Hark, O'Hark,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000] O'Hark, my wine said he,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000] and everything nice,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000] and nice, and how do you like my fair lady
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000] that lies in your arms asleep?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000] Very much I like it all,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000] also your wine so sweet,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000] but the fairs of all this whole white world
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000] now lies in my arms asleep.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000] Now rise rise rise young men said he,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000] and do the best you can,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000] for I wouldn't have said in pescat,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000] and that I kill you at tens of men,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000] rise rise to you,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000] I dare not do,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000] I dare not for my life,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000] for you have to sort by your side,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000] and I have near a knife,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000] if I have to sort by my side,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000] they caused me deep in my purse,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000] but you shall have the very best one,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000] and I shall have the worst,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000] and you shall strike the very first blow,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000] but strike it like a man,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000] and I shall strike the very next blow,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000] and I'll kill you if I can,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000] my guru, he struck the very first blow,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000] and wounded Lord Vanneford's sword,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000] Lord Vanneford's struck the very next blow,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000] and my guru could strike no more,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000] rise rise rise rise my lady said he,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000] and fall upon your knees,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000] then tell to me,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000] who you love bestest young, my guru,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000] or me,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000] if Lord Vanneford laid at my,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000] at my feet,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000] or bleeding in his sword,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000] I could not shed one tear for him,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000] or no, no, not one.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000] Then he took her round the way so small,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000] and killed his gave her three,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000] and him is right held a sword
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000] and pierced her fire body.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000] Come all my servant men said he,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000] who here are standing round,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000] who saw me in such angry blood
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000] and could not stop my wound.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000] They're not a white kill, that's very young man,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000] that's got to and could afford,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000] like why is the fearlessly,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000] that air the sun shone on,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000] and soon you see there will be three,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000] for fatal is my wound.
