[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040] RUSEN THE WALL
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.340] I live for the good of my nation
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.440] And my sons are all growing slow
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.280] But I hope that my next generation
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680] Wouldn't assemble or rosin' their bow
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.360] I travel this hour world over
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.000] And now to the next I will go
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.480] For know that the quarters are with me
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.080] To welcome more rosin' their bow
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.040] In the gay rounds of pleasure I travel
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.400] Nor will I be high-leever-ful
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.680] And when my companions are jovel
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120] They will drink too more rosin' their bow
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.160] But my life is now drawn to the closing
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.600] And all the last be so
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600] So we'll take a full bumper of our parting
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.600] To the name of all rosin' their bow
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.320] What I did then laid out on the counter
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.080] The people making us show
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.920] Just sprinkle plain whiskey and water
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.520] On the corpse of all rosin' their bow
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.920] I'll have to prepare it a rake and
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.600] And the ladies will want to know
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.440] And they lift up the lid of my coffin
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.960] Sing you like all rosin' their bow
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.120] Oh, went to my grave, I am going
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.480] The children will all want to go
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.680] They'll run to the doors and the windows
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.120] Sing they goes all rosin' their bow
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.520] Then pick me your sick trusty fellows
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.880] And let them most earn in a row
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.160] And dig a big hole in the center
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.520] And into toss rosin' their bow
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360] Then shape me our two little darnings
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.960] And place one at my head at my toe
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.400] And do not forget to scratch on it
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.680] The name of all rosin' their bow
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.160] Then let those six trusty good fellows
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.520] All let them most earn in a row
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.040] And rake down that big belly bottle
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.400] And drink to all rosin' their bow
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.960] My father broke the ice and gone
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.960] My father's broke the ice and gone
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.000] Oh, Lord, how long
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.960] And soon we'll sing down with song
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.960] Oh, Lord, how long
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.960] They for this time another year
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.000] I may be gone
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.120] And in some looms some graveyard
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.960] Oh, Lord, how long
