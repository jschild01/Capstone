[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160] another so long after quecess pulling on her o'clock.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.760] Learn her accutlers us those lawn.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760] A titre of suffering we don't equal her crept.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.040] Fart for wasky snatched conceited her from
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.520] noon witess and some foie no organic
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520] Her gun's a dangerous, a terrific power that savages,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520] Trambole, a sea that's full sound.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.520] They lor and sustain the most dreadful fires she fought for two glasses or more.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520] While Perry undontered, did firmly stand by her,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520] The trouble one ever had, broadsided force.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520] Her master, ink shatter her,
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520] Her raking all-paped her, booms and her yard being all-shutter-weigh.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520] And she left something to manage the wreck.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520] Her hero won't wored no longer could stay.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520] In this situation, the pride of the nation,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520] Sure heaven had guarded and heard all the while.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520] While many are hero maintaining his station,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.520] So close to his sight and was thrown on the pile.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520] But mark you and wonder when the elements thunder,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.520] When death and destruction are stalking all round.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520] Is like he did carry on for the nigh,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520] A grist that's valid on record was never yet found.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520] There is one gallant tank,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520] To an open commander while writing my song,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.520] I must notice with pride,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.520] While lost in the boat that carried the standard of ball was so true.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520] We're just close to his sight,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.520] Says Perry, the rescues in ten four to round us,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520] But push on my break, where you need never fear.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520] And with his own coat, he plugged up the boat and two fired and suffered away,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520] Dixir,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.520] That famous nigh, I grew now proud of her prairie,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.520] Displayed all her banners in gallant array,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.520] And twenty-five guns on her decked carry,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520] Which soon put the nigh to this bloody afraid.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520] There irreverably,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520] For brought up complete,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520] The signal was given to break through the line.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.520] While starboard in my board and from every quarter,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520] The lamps that could lump your disloyalously shine.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.520] The ball British lie in Lord of his last under,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520] When Perry attacked it,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520] Then close in the rear,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520] Colombe as they go,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520] To make him crouch under and roar out for quarter,
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.520] As soon you shall hear,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.520] Oh, has you been there,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520] I now do declare such a sight as you never had seen before.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520] Six reddied blood flanks,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520] That no longer could wank,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520] Go lay at the feet of a brave farmer,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520] Door,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520] Brake, I lay at whose valor must now be recorded on boards in the nigh,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520] Aggress, oh, well placed his part.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.520] His gallant assistance to Perry afforded,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.520] Will place in the second on Lake Eury's charge.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520] In the midst of the battle,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520] When guns they did rattle,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520] The Lord and Sir,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520] Reckon the memorial slain,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520] Away he distilled and brought up the rear,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.520] And by this maneuver,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.520] The victory was gained.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.520] All had you but seen,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.520] Those noble commanders embracing each other
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520] When the conflict was door,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.520] And viewing all those invincible standards
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.520] That never had yielded to any before.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520] That Perry brave ally,
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520] At give me your answer this day,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.520] We have gained an immortal renown.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520] So long as some week,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520] Wakingly command,
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.520] Let break after an Elliott with Lord of the Crown.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.520] Great Britain may boast of a concurring heroes,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520] Her rodney's her Nelson's and all her whole crew.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.520] But none in their glory have to such a story,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.520] Nor boast of defeat as Colombe and doom.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.520] The whole British League was captured,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520] And the British captured complete,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520] Not one single vessel from a scutterway,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520] And present some hundred Colombe,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520] And wondered to see all them,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520] And could more go see,
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.520] Not they may have,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.520] And still smile on the shades of our heroes,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520] Who fought in that conflict,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520] They're country to save,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.520] And check the proxperies of murdering brails,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.520] That wish to divide us and make us all slaves,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.520] Colombe and same, and make us all slaves.
