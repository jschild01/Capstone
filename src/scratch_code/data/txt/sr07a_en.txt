[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000] The song is part of the thing that jumps you.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000] The choir is and make it flat.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000] Otherwise have a good time.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000] And this is the chorus.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.780] So we would laugh.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.000] Sorry, I just told you about it once.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000] You dirty, dirty eyes.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000] Swapp your running color,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000] Like inside of scum,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000] дал you and come clear.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000] The Lord would upset you.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000] Very weak.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000] It's a little bit of a type.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000] What does it mean?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000] Yeah, and anything?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000] Oh, it's a Java vacation song just for fun.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000] Father, true well-father.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000] You should die of a blessing for taking gold from an invertible who plounds a low and slow.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000] Father, true well-father.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000] You should die of a blessing for taking gold from an invertible who plounds a low and slow.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000] I can tell it's about this song.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000] It was bold.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000] This is an old song that my parents used to sing to us on New Yorkers on the boat.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000] And it's written on a minor.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000] I don't know whether England or what country.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000] And it was a merry-he-sweet heart who put up at her father's tavern,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000] but she worked out on the meantime.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000] She had a dream that night that her lover was killed and she saw the blood running.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000] And then woke her up, she came to father excited and asked him about her fiance.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000] And he told her to keep her mouth shut.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000] That his gold would make a show that he sent his body seeking to the long-sum low lands low.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000] So that's the history and prose that verse.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000] And then she told her father that he'd be punished.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000] Yes, she sang that verse then, totally.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000] And he told her she told him what would happen.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000] He'd die public show.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000] I'll sing that verse again and get me.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000] Father, true well-father.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000] You should die of public show for taking gold from an invertible who plounds a low and slow.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000] The man was short of victory.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000] Same fear stood at the golden gate with a golden man and an air-sidate.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000] When up to the top of the golden stair,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000] I'll sing that verse again.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000] Father, true well-father.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000] You should die of public show for taking gold from an invertible who plounds a low and slow.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000] The man was short of victory.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000] With a golden man and an air-sidate,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000] When up to the top of the golden stair,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000] A man and his wife, they did appear.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000] The man was short of victory.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000] Can stop.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000] They fly toward mission, but looked about before same beards so great and good.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000] They finally came.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000] And a layer of this stone,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000] They were when was tall and length so thin.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000] With a scribe you'd be left under her chin.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000] The man was short of victory.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000] The stone was still surrounded.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000] His face was pleasant and all the while.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000] He wore a kindly and jay of smile.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000] The quars in the distance.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000] The echoes woke.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000] The man kept to while the woman spoke.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000] Although who guards the gates and she.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000] We too hear their besieging day.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000] To let us enter the heavenly land.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000] And play our heart to the angel band.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000] Of me say, Peter, there is no doubt.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000] There's nothing from heaven to vermile.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000] I've been to meetings in times of week.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000] And almost always I'd rise and speak.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000] I told the sinners about the day.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000] When they'd repent of their evil way.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000] I told my neighbors, I told them all about Adam and Eve.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000] And the poor mill for.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000] I showed them what they'd have to do.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000] It'd have passed in with the chosen fruit.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000] I'd mark the path and do tickleered.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000] Played out the plan for the whole career.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000] I came to the origin of this stone.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000] Of course you know.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000] I don't know who wrote it, but we should sing it on the canal.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000] Pairs did. I haven't learned very well.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000] But they say we had much fun about it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000] It was asked for it for a number of times.
