[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000] There was no woman lived under the hill.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Oh, there he began.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000] There was no woman lived under the hill.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000] She hasn't moved much.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000] She is living there still, so there he began.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000] Presenting a report to the American people by the ballot honder.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000] In each of these programs, the Library of Congress presents John A. Lomax, the ballot honder.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000] For more than 30 years, Mr. Lomax has been gathering the songs of the American people.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000] Songs that were not written down are learned from books, but folk songs of the people sung by the people in maiden recordings on the very scene.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000] To collect these songs, Mr. Lomax has written night heard with cowboys, visited ballot singers far back in the mountains,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000] gone to dances in the country, spoken to tenant farmers in the deep south.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000] But today we are going to hear the story of two old men, not so old, however, that they didn't love folk songs.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.000] In the autumn of 1936, I received a letter from a lady reporter in the acrohone of how, saying that a wonderful ballot singer lived in that town.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000] I packed my recording equipment in my car and arrived in acrohone the following week.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000] The kind reporter brought to my room a big, breezy, wholesome, smiling man.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000] I am the last of the Ohio Canal Captains, Kevin Perlarni, said to me,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000] You know I was born on a canal boat which ran from acrohone to the Ohio River, down which we floated our cargo to Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000] My family was a singing botch, my great grandmother's brought many folk songs from England,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000] and we all picked up more songs in this country wherever we travel.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000] We knew hundreds, I am fixing them all up to send them to the library of Congress.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:15.000] Captain I had brought with him an armful of manuscripts, rolled into scrolls, each scroll made up of 20 or 30 long yellow sheets of paper, pasted and together.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000] Before Captain I had finished his recording, he was almost recovered in a pile of manuscripts.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000] The first song that he sang for me tells about a trip on the canal.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000] Take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000] You may talk of your pleasure, trip down the great lakes, but a trip on these scroll boats you better take a look at.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000] These take us tough as a fighting doesn't it?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000] As they play tag with the cook come the day.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000] The potato she'll burn with the coffee boil or the film nearly choke you so breezy the floor.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000] The cook rooms are limous, you must eat or die, and when it's all over you let till you cry.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000] So hauling the toll on and take up the slack, take a reef in your shirt, tail and straight in your bag.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000] Whatever you do be sure don't forget, that the muse gently will cook your zondag.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000] All those rookie times and no equal every whatever they were they would run night or day.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000] If I owned a world on the ditch I would run for no other place as such or shins are fun.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000] I ask Captain I, where he had learned this song.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000] He'll hear his story on the record.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000] My buddy's a singer to me and the rest of us children were small, gather around a neon deck of the canal which is our home.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000] That's many years ago been a favorite on the canal also.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000] How long were you on the canal? 40 years.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000] Did you tell me you were born on the canal?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000] Yes sure, I was born there and raised there.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000] Where were you born?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000] Shilakatiya Hayah, a propane street bridge on the canal board. Now what reform?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000] Tell something about your family on the canal.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000] Well, there were a large family, 18 of us 11 boys and seven girls and I'm the 15th boy or 15th youngster, nice boy.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000] And we had one bed old times swimming falling over board and as you might expect them a large family.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000] And music in song or less can throw their home. We all had good times.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000] Captain I went on.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000] When I first started to write down the words of the old songs, I often found that I remembered the tune but not the words.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000] I'd keep humming the tunes.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000] The law of a sudden the old words would bob up.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000] That's the way that I remembered the old favorite, the dark-eyed canaler.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000] It was a lovely young lady fair.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000] Was walking out to take the earth.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000] She met the kneller upon the way.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000] So I paid attention.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000] So I paid attention to hear what they did say.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000] Fair made said he, why you roam alone.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000] The night is calm and the days for gone.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000] She drew a dagger and then did cry.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:39.000] For my dark-eyed canalers, for my dark-eyed canalers, oh may he live or die.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000] The way I love the songs of old England proves that I'm a real Britisher.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000] I said Captain I, I guess Barbara Allen is my favorite of them all.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000] Captain I sang through the entire length of at least a dozen of the standard English ballads.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000] The Library of Congress has 83 versions of Barbara Allen,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000] but none is more beautiful than the tune Captain I sang for me.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000] There's a star-let town where I was born.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000] There was a fair made well-earned.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000] Made every you, I will I wear.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000] And a name was Barbara Allen.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000] All in the merry months of May.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000] When the green birds were a swelling,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000] sweet William King from Western States,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000] and gorgeous Barbara Allen.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000] Get me night at clad.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000] I was blessed with comical parents.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000] My father songs are especially when nothing but nonsense.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000] We all like to sing Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000] One other folks would gather on our stern deck,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000] where we had our sure enough jalafication.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000] There was no woman lived under the hill.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000] There was no woman lived under the hill.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000] She hasn't moved away. She's living there still.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000] One day she sent a romantic flower.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000] One day she sent a romantic flower.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000] And when they got there, he didn't know how.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000] He hadn't gone but around her too.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000] He hadn't gone but around her too.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000] He's part of the old devil all in for you.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000] After I had spent two happy days with a dolly old bachelor.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000] Captain Nine.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000] He said to me gravely as we parted.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000] These songs are sacred to me.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000] They bring back memories of the silver ribbon.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000] They all how can now.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000] That was the best life.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000] Amen.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000] Amen.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000] Perhaps so you can't see things that's as I do.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000] I'm not supposed to see as you do.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000] For my mind is canal.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000] He's a girl long to help that door and set her down and set no more.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000] Ten little devil came to buy her side.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000] Ten little devil came separate sides.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000] That they were all proud of Papa's new bright.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000] One little devil who wore a blue cap.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000] One little devil who wore a blue cap.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000] She was a poker and soon finished that.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000] She fought her family and they were still.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000] She fought her family and they were still.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000] And kind of destroy everything.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000] Oh, then no.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000] You have just heard another story told by the ballot hundred.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000] The songs heard on this program were actually recorded on the scene.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000] This program with Mr. John A. Lowmax Honorary Curator of the Archive of the American
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000] Folks song was presented by the Radio Research Project of the Library of Congress.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000] And the I have come for you, your oldest son.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000] Oh Daddy Bee Gay.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000] I found for you, your oldest son, your hurry, hurry and we will be gone.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000] So Daddy Bee Gay and he can be.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000] The song is presented by the Radio Research Project of the Library of Congress.
