[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600] Take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.160] You may talk of your pleasure trip to Omnick Great Lakes but a trip on these grail boats
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.800] to bet takes the cake.

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200] on the deck.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.400] The potato she'll burn with the coffee boil or the few nearly choke you so breezy the
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400] floor.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.680] The cook rooms are lima, chew must eat or die and when it's all over you left till
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.960] you cry.

[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.760] All those work eight times and no week will have day whatever they were they would run
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.720] night or day.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.360] If I owned a world on the ditch I would run for no other place as such oceans of fun.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.640] She still found a biscuit she makes and like wraps and will enter you if you fall in
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.640] the locks.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.120] They do for a cannon with them we kill snakes you're not long one board until every
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.120] two fates.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.960] Her pleasure like leather you need teeth of steel whenever you eat the mushrooms
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960] you feel.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.080] Her soups are the lima, though yes all are chow we put it the way but I will tell you how.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.680] The water pale off and you know what get dry she'd open the window dip up a supply.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.840] In the food you could taste it the captain would rare but one looked from her and the weather
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.640] was fair.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.560] She sure had an answer for all that was said.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560] If you would cross her she'd try to raise the day.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.560] Though wonders were many you'd let cry around.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.560] Take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560] Down stream at the locks she would throw off the line.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.560] Beat the bows when the snubs bring up paddle divine.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.120] To the line hit the dead I opened up that gate but the work in the cabin she really did
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120] hate.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.120] We all got disgusted the captain would snorke dance redden to fur when we got in
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120] pool.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.120] Her ways were so winning whatever may come.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120] Take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.120] The super limb tentant when he was around was custom to eat on the first boat he found.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.120] Sometimes he would hesitate often object but the first thing he knew was the cookup
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120] deck.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.120] Her hip nodded guys and that wonderful smile would catch the old boy and he'd eat right
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120] for miles.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.120] But times were abundant for dinner may come.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.120] Take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.120] We all have our trouble but this rule we keep is moving about easy the cook is asleep.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.080] We laughed on our upper the greatest of care and know what this coming is she could
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080] get the scare.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.080] A great violin sailor and smokes like a stove.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080] The pipe drips off freely and so does her nose.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.080] The day both she wakes packers put on more steam.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.080] Take a glad to escape where there are put down stream.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.080] They locked tenders.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.080] When they pull in the locks collectors are out of play with their clocks.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.080] The passengers smile but they don't say a word.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.080] Her voice is the music she loves to be heard.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.080] Troops use her bells but it all seems insane for when they are through she will start
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080] up again.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.080] She sure was a cookup whatever I run take a trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.080] She knew just what day I took put the line on.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.080] The pit locks and dry things there is when the song.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.080] Because they were li8 and was off that mistake was there with a good if you wanted
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.080] things quick.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080] She got a wet scrub that decked and could run off of climb.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.080] Would jump with a pool from the boat to the bay.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:42.080] To the light gay and easy whatever may come they could trip on the canal if you want to have fun.
