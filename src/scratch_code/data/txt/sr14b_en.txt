[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000] And the stars find gold banner so proudly kept waving,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000] And stained by the blood of the Comberland crew.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000] When traders found cannon no longer available,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000] For fighting those heroes with garonger side,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000] The cause of this session no longer to quail them,

[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000] And as we were sinking in the dark rolling river,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000] We'll die at our guns, set the Comberlands crew.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000] Slowly she sang, can Virginia's dark waters,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000] Our voices on swell shall never be heard more,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000] May we weep,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000] By Comberland's race sounds and proud daughters,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000] By the blood of the Vibens in Virginia's shore,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000] In the battle, St. Rivers so silently sleeping,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000] The most of our heroes and swells better do,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000] And the stars bangled banner so proudly was waving,

[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000] No flag ever floated so proudly before,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000] Now while those heroes who fought for the union,

[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000] For beneath his proud foe, we'll cause tyrants to tumble,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000] Or die at our guns like the Comberland crew.
