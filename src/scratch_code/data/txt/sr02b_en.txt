[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000] There is the girl in our town. She makes the flat, she makes the sun.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000] She tries to talk and that ring around. I as a black and turtable.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000] She gets along with sunny smile. No doubt she's so bristly, my little.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000] She's happy for her. She sings the song to girl the strike the stocky song.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000] She is the clever, dressed as well. Her voice is like a winter spell.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000] All she is up to learn and sing. It all you often say, well, full. She's cute and stingy.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000] This I see, the way she lifts her dress to me. Don't roll me shy, then jolly song.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000] The girl the strike the stocky song. Where's the voice?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000] Oh, and oh boy, you can ride in yellow ship, oh boy. Oh, yes, the time she is quite weatherproof.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000] Smiling she, you a key, follow. She's always busy up and down. And very well, she knows the tone.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000] For dancing eyes and Mary's song, the girl the strike the stocky song.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000] Had this like the basket too, you wonder where the flowers grew. And just by she was waded down.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000] Or was she standing like a com? All for skirt could make the tent.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000] But the stylish things seem much content with all the clothes. She would put on the girl the strike the stocky song.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000] You wonder next what she will do. The weather's wet or dry, she lifts her dress and then then pass by.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000] But always with her little song, the girl the strike the stocky song.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000] In Scarlett town where I was born, there was a fair made welling.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000] Made every youth, I will aware, and a name was Barbrae Allen.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000] All in the merry month of May, when the green birds were a swelling.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000] Sweet William came from western states and quartet Barbrae Allen.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:56.000] All was in the month of June, when all things were a blooming sweet William on his death that lay.

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000] He sent his servants to the town where Barbrae was a dwelling.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000] My master's sick and since for you, if your name is Barbrae Allen.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000] And death is paid on his face and always hard is still in.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000] Them haste away to comfort him, all lovely Barbrae Allen.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000] So slowly slowly she got up and slowly she came to him.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000] And all she said when she got there young man I paid your dying.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000] Oh yes, oh yes, I'm very sick and death is only stealing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000] No better, no I'll never be.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000] If I can't have Barbrae Allen.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000] Oh yes, your sick and very sick and death is only stealing.

[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000] All don't you remember in the under town.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000] When you were at the tavern, you drank a hell to the ladies all round.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000] And sighted Barbrae Allen.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000] As she was on her highway home, the bird kept on singing.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000] They sing so clear they seem to say,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000] Hardhearted Barbrae Allen.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:16.000] As she was walking or the fields, she heard the death bell nailing and move.
