[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] The Gospel Cheerios.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000] I'm a soldier of the Lord and I have signed up for life.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000] No matter what the field or whatever be the strength,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000] If service or I love it, then find things rare and right,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000] And it's their I love to shine.

[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000] The King highway is quite the place to see who can't be found.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000] His loving kindness tender mercedes with grace upon.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000] Give it out for air you go, let all hear the joyful sound.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000] Yes and we go rolling on.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000] All the sins are lost and dying.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000] We always take them in.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000] No matter who or where they are,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000] If they call unto him, they're room for all.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000] So now get in, escape the storm of sin.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000] Now as we go rolling on,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000] There's nothing can be standing.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000] She is every rolling on.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000] Oh hear the music left, oh so the joyful sound.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000] Everybody's feeling happy, jumped in and come along.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000] Yes as we go rolling on.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000] So we're all the old Gospel Cheerios the long.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000] We will all the old Gospel Cheerios the long.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000] Dying cowboy.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000] So we're the one morning.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000] I wrote all the branches.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000] So early one morning.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000] I wrote all the wire.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000] I saw a young cowboy.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000] All dressed in white linen.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000] With cold black eyes and waving black hair.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000] My friends and relation.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000] I left them in Boston.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000] My parents knew not where I had room.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000] I first went to Texas and hired a ransomman.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000] I guess you're out in the bosom and death is my doom.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000] Please write me a letter to my great mother.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000] And break the news to my sister so dear.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000] But there is another as dear as my mother.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000] Oh, we, if she knew I was dying out here.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000] Now take me to the graveyard and place the sad or me.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000] And play the dead march as I declare me on.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000] Just eat the drum or me.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000] And play the fight slowly.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000] For I'm dead cowboy and no life and wrong.
