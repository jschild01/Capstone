[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Writing on the elevator road.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000] While writing on the elevator road, I'll tell you all about it in my song.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000] I looked at all the secondary windows, while the little train is moving right along.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000] Some were reading, some were drinking, some were sleeping, some were laughing and some they cry.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000] Some were fun, they cite, I saw there, I looked at them as we went by.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000] Writing on the elevator road is pleasant and it just suits me.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000] Take a day or night, you'll say I'm right, some very funny sights you will see.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000] The cruise is crowded.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000] In London, sweet city, a fair damsel that dwells.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000] A wealth of liberty, no tongue could I tell.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:24.000] She was courted by sailor for two bayous brine, and two him is trade with a shippipe and a shippipe.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000] The ship's cool carpenter.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000] In London, sweet city, a fair damsel that dwells.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000] A wealth of liberty, no tongue could I tell.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000] She was courted by sailor for two bayous brine, and him two is trade with a shippipe and a shippipe.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.000] He says, my Miss Mary, if you will agree, if you will consent, go along with me.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000] I will ease you from trouble or sorrow and fear.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000] If you will but Mary, your ships carpenter.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000] Through braces and kisses, they parted that night.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000] She started next morning, for to meet him by lie.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:41.000] He led her through ditches and valleys so deep, to the length this fair damsel began for two weeks.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000] She says, my sweet will young, you've led me astray.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000] On purpose, my innocent life to betray.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000] He says, my Miss Mary, you have guessed it right.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000] For I was digging your grave all last night.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000] She turned her head down her grave that she spined.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000] Saying, is this the bright bed for me you've provided?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000] Oh pardon, sweet will young and spare me my life.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000] Let me be distressed if I can't be your wife.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000] For pardon, sweet will young, is the worst of all men.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000] Heaven will reward you when I'm dead than gone.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000] No time for two weeks, no time for two stand.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000] He instantly taking his knife in his hand.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000] Into her fair body, his knife ended go.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000] And the blood from her body, like a fountain did flow.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000] He covered her all up straight home or return.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000] Let no one to mourn but the small birds alone.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000] They kept in them some men.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000] The whole of his crew.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000] He said, my brave boys, I'm afraid some of you.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000] Have murdered some danger before we came away.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000] That will cause us to hate the father of the whole city.
