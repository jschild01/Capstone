[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560] I owe $10 to a gritty.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.320] Once I had a neighbor seems sweet this honey and whatever he possessed he said was mine.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.040] I had sickness for a time and short a manly so I call on him or seems to superfine.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.160] Oh I owe $10 to a gritty and you think he had a mortgage on my life.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.280] Every morning he would call around the sea me and a night he would send around his wife.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.920] When I get back to work he would ask for tady.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.120] I told him and said that hell too weak bank and he said there must be something very
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.000] rotten when they told a fellow's money back like that.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.040] But still he told him to see me every morning.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.680] My every action he just seemed to know and his other friends all seemed to smile about it.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.120] And I said there's nothing but a great slow.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.040] Oh I owe $10 to a gritty and you think he had a mortgage on my life.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.960] Every morning he would call around the sea me and a night he would send around his wife.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:34.240] Well at last my pady come plus full and blooming for I worked all over time that I that I could.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.080] As I never cared to see your grace you know so I paid him back in full with him for school.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.720] So I owed $10 to a gritty and you think he had a mortgage on my life.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:02:02.000] Every morning he would call around the sea me and a night he would send around his wife.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360] Why is he with the girls I see?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.040] Love it is a very funny thing it catches the young and the old.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.520] It makes you feel like a fresh water real and causes your head to swell.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.480] Your heart is a flutter than many things you love for you.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.960] Think that everything is going well.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880] But your death doesn't blind on the floor because you can find until you are delivered from
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880] your spell.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.760] So boys keep away from the girls I see and give them lots of room.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.720] For mine when you went they will bang you till you did with a ball hit at end of the
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720] room.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.920] When the man falls in love with a little turtle down everything is new.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.920] Well kiss if our mother sister brother tell her father comes in view.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.600] A gun from his pocket to tell the hand to cop it to blow away his little little brains.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.880] It's loaded so it doesn't manage as he must and they're kissing one another once again.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.520] When she gets in your power then you are busy all the while.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.000] You will linger all around her under jaw with such a silly smile.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.960] Your English lesson gig is like a kangaroo wiggles for she always likes to have you come
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960] away.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.840] She will sing she will dance she has to take a trip to France.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.760] Then you will come home alone some rainy day.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.240] So boys keep away from the girls I see and give them lots of room.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.320] For mine when you went they were bang you till you did with a ball hit at end of the
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320] room.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.880] When you are 16 half star kids and must wear second-hand clothes and wear two turn
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.200] for the next meal and wearing your pleasure on your nose.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360] The butchard comes along with a gun down some to collect his bills you don't know where
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.880] to turn.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.040] You have little honey but you have a nanny money and your face is rid as fire short as
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040] burn.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.240] Say just watch them when they go down street for you will say that I am right.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.600] Let's see everyone that passes where they are morning noon or night.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.280] They are out for a walk and are my mouth at all.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.160] Yes they are tongues unlike a fanning will you know how the flirt tallies and a very
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.320] ill-a-ease watch a step my boy and near them never go.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.560] So boys keep away from the girls I say and give them lots of room.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.520] For mine when you went they are bang you till you did with a ball hit at end of the
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.920] room.
