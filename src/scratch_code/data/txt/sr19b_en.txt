[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000] What is the worst thing in the world when not kept in control?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000] Can rob you all this life and act?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000] Yes, of your very soul.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000] Oh many things that I could say, but they you must know all.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000] Before I lie when I kiss you between me and the world.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000] The worst thing in the world is tongue.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000] When said on fire by hell, the robber still just,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000] moor too old with the shell not well.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000] I know all this there is no end, we know each other's call.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000] And step by step we'll go through life, no matter what the war.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000] Pretty silly.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000] There was a rich lady from London she came.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000] She called herself silly.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000] Pretty silly by name.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000] Her wealth is worse more than the king he possess.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000] Her beauty was more than her wealth of others.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000] There was a poor doctor was living nearby.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000] Who on this fair doomsday in love cast his eye.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000] He courted her nightly a year and a day.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000] But still see if you see, I never said may.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000] Oh, Sally, oh, Sally.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000] But the Sally said he, can you tell me the reason?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000] My love can't agree.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000] Your cruel unkindness may ruin will prove.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000] Unless all your hatred will turn into love.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000] No hatred, I bear you, nor no other man.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000] But surely too fancy you I never can.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000] Give over your courting I pray you be still.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000] For you I'll never marry, oh my own free will.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000] But soon after this era you had passed by.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000] Pretty Sally grew sick and she pitchy would die.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000] She tangled words and lovin' herself she accused.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000] So sent for the doctor she once had refused.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000] Oh, am I that doctor?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000] Who skill you would try?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000] Or am I the young man?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000] You once did deny?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000] Yes you were the doctor can cure, can cure.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000] Unless you will help me, I'm dying to cure.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000] Oh, Sally, oh, Sally.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000] Oh, Sally said he, oh don't you remember.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000] How you slighted me.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000] You treated me like me, my love you discord.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000] So now you must suffer for the past you have done.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000] If they are past, if their past and gone lovin' for getten for give.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000] And suffer me longer in this world to live.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000] I never can forgive you until my dying day.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000] Oh, you're great.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000] Well, on your grave I will dance and you're late in cold play.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000] Sheep.
