[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000] Between me and the wall.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000] Say, O, Long Court Chips, I'm not found.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000] You have courted now with you.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000] Two, three.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000] Say, O, Long Court Chips, I'm not found.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000] You have courted now with you.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000] Say, O, Long Court Chips, I'm not found.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000] You have courted now with you.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000] Do me more time as always.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000] So please my version here.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000] I might must be united always one, but here before.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000] Before I lie one night with you between me and the wall.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000] These questions I will put to you, and you must answer well.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000] Yes, for I must have a equal through life with me too,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000] my heart and love I give to the one who answers all.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000] And faithful I will ever be who answers my heart's call.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000] What is the birth that flies most high?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000] And how does it come down?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000] Yes, where it lives also it's nest and how may it be found?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000] Sharp a sigh of living thing that sees all both large and small
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000] and praise upon the farmer, yes, and many things that grow.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000] All your bird, it is the eagle and fold its wings rose in the fall.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000] If nested mountains and I trees, praise on things large and small,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000] it lives in many countries, gorgeous young with fighting zeal.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000] Of reptiles it is very fun, the farmer's talk will steal.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000] Where are the darkest day and night, and what fruit has a stone?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000] The animal that has no voice, and why is to leave alone?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000] What reptile often bites a cell, but in trouble ends it all.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000] What quadruped we often say, sure love to bite and stall.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000] Now Egypt's darkest night, day and night, are known the whole world round.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000] The giraffe can kick, but no voice, but you will well too.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000] Make no sound.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000] What is higher than the heavens and deeper than the sea?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000] Who commanded this and stand still, which cause his foes to flee?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000] Highest mountain in all earth, yes, likewise trees and foes,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000] and why are storms upon the sea so often termed as foes?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000] Higher than the heavens and for deeper than the sea, is mind of man triumphant,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000] which lives only turnily.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000] Joshua in Israel, who spoke unto the sun, his foes he slew on every side,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000] and how the rest did run.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000] O highest mountain everless, and see quay in this tree,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000] and bridal veil foes are again so beautiful to see.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000] The storm-poe turned, squows upon the sea, no warning to a veil,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000] and day the junters locker off is where the ships must sail.
