[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000] If you're past and gone long for getten for you and suffer me longer in this world to live,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000] I nircan for give you one to my dying day.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000] On you grave I will dance when you're late in cold play.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000] She pulled from her fingers, then diamonds ring three,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000] St. Take these and with them while you're dancing on me.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000] I freely forgive you though me you disdain.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000] So now you must leave me and sorrow and pain.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000] The Jews daughter.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000] It rained and misty rained and misty rained and all around,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000] but all the boys in our town went out to toss their ball,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000] they tossed one up, they tossed one high,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000] one went into a Jews guard and by where no one was there to go,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000] now I, where no one was there to go, now I,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000] I came to Jews' doctor dressed in red,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000] then ties still a little boy in,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000] come in, come in, you dinner to boy,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000] you can have your ball again,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000] she called for a charger and the night for the kids,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000] she's hard to run in, all the boys were sad and new,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000] he never come out again, he never come out again.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.000] The butcher boy, in London City where I,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000] did well, but just boy, I love so well,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000] he stole from me my heart away,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000] and with me now he will not stay.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000] There was a strange girl in the town,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000] my lover he sets her down,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000] and takes that strange girl on his knee,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000] and tells to her what he won't tell me,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000] it's brief to me, I'll tell you why,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000] because she has more goal in my,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000] but goal will melt and silver fly,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000] true love will never, never die.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000] Last night my lover promised me,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000] he'd meet me cross the deep blue sea,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000] but now he's gone, left me alone,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000] and north and girl to weep and mourn.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000] Go dig my grave both wide and deep,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000] face a marble slab at my head and feet,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000] or my eye broke,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000] there's no white down,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000] for the proof to the world I died for love.
