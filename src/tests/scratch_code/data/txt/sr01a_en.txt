[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] When you're ready, check it out.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000] It's not over again.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000] It's over again.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000] Well, Matt, well, Matt, my own two-lough.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000] Well, Matt, well, Matt, this is he.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000] I just say, turns from the so-called water sea,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000] and it's all for the love of the.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000] And it's all for the love of the.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000] I might have married a king's daughter fair.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000] It gave her a married me,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000] but I have mistaken all the crowns of gold,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000] and it's all for the love of the.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000] And it's all for the love of the.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000] If you could have married a king's daughter fair,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000] I'm sure you were much shorter-blane.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000] For I have married a house-cruffender,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000] and I think he's a nice young man,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000] and I think he's a nice young man.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000] If you will leave your house-cruffender,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000] and go along with me,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000] I'll take you for the grass,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000] grows those green on the shores of Italy,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000] on the shores of Italy.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000] I have seven ships,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000] and I'm still lying in for,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000] and seven more out on sea,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000] 140 bay,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000] seven men,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000] and all for the love of the.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000] And all for the love of the.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000] All then she called her little bane,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000] and kiss us, give it three,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000] say, stay at home,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000] I let go,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000] they keep your fathers company,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000] then she prepared for thee,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000] dress, see best in the rich, just a turn,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000] and as she walked this streets
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000] along everyone,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000] they heard my,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000] everyone did heard my,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000] everyone did heard my,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000] she had not been that sea three weeks,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000] I'm sure it was not for,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000] until she began to leave the house-cruffender,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000] you never see a anymore,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000] although I might never see any more,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000] I might never be there for my.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000] Their life has been a pity for you,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000] however you've come to bloom,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000] and how much can you rule this country thron you,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000] because you are definitely the only kind when you whine,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.600] For your goal I weed, or neither for my friend.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.000] If this for my dear, let's obey that I never can see anymore.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.400] That I never can see anymore.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.600] The gallants ship she's praying at least, as she's still the virgin sea.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.800] And St. B. needs the stormy ways and never more to be.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.200] And never more to be.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.200] No matter how I aburd my flight,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200] it must come down for the dream.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.400] That these we saw into harvest grow Lord help us to stop and think,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.800] Lord help us to stop and think.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.000] Oh, I know.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.800] What's up, again?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:49.800] We are loaded for this out of all my meals for the make that best of luckers.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800] There's a nip for you all.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.600] Yes, yes, all the crew for the class.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600] As I have the end of the earth,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.600] You'll bet we take our little jumps along
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600] No matter what the size of colors
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.600] For it warns us of what ever be the hours
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.600] Be it summer winter anywhere there
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600] Yes, the old side, the old valley, mils are great
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600] He eats corn and wheat, bushels, manny
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600] She's a great big boy and still your heart was joy
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.600] Like a lot when brother monoprenees
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600] There's way, way, way, angelic, coffee, too
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600] Circleville and life, still so handy
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.600] And a rainbow for we have the funnest for everybody
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.600] Feeling fine and dirty, sometimes we go down the Ohio whiskey town
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.600] Senat, the frisky and bandy
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.600] But it was our boat, then keep all things afloat
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.600] For we know that all things were handy
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600] But no matter what the trip would be
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600] The canam was my only lover
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600] And I never cared for any other place
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600] In my heart there's no room for...
