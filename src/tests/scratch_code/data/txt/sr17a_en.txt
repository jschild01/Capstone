[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000] On the banks of Silly, one evening a young lady fair, her stay throwed out to see,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.640] when a roguey snipe stepped out and said, her mate you will ride with me, so it's you and
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:35.640] night together, love. How happy we will be, and we'll both sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.640] She looked at him and then about and said, let me lead the way, for I know this part quite well,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.640] and it's many hours till day, so it's you and I together, love. How happy we will be, and we'll both sport together,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:13.640] on the banks of Silly. She was slimy just like a fox. She went round and round and so, when she saw her plans would work, she was cautious, very slow, so what you and I together, love.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:27.640] How happy we will be, and we'll both sport together on the banks of Silly. She wrote on a dapple grey, and he on a dapple brown,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.640] they wrote in the children's woods, three are before him done, so what you and I together, love.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:50.640] How happy we will be, and we'll both sport together on the banks of Silly. So often he was very rude, and on him then she went round,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.640] and last she said, let's follow his house, there is a bed of down, so with you and I together, love.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.640] How happy we will be, and we'll both sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.640] And last they reached her father's house, and she wrote in through the gate, and said, now I am safe at home,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:31.640] you go before us to late for us, you and I together, love. How happy we may be, but we'll not sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:45.640] Oh, curse all women then said he, they will always man deceive, and he is ever fool enough, the stories too believe so with you and I together, love.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.640] I'll have the way we will be, but we'll not sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:06.640] She pulled out a little pen knife, the stuff get in the ground, I wish this was in any man's heart, who would write for bed of down, so with you and I together, love.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.640] I'll have the way we may be, but we'll not sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:27.640] You'll like the little white rooster that runs among the hands, he flops his wings, but they're not crow, you're just like one of them, so with you and I together, love.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.640] How happy we will be, and we'll not sport together on the banks of Silly.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.640] Thank you.
