[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.080] I return to my fair Nancy,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.520] but he had a pin gone for years or day,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.400] Spain's country for two seas.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.640] When languishing thoughts came to his mind,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.320] Lady Nancy Belly,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.720] mootsy, Lady Nancy Belly would see.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.600] So he rode and he rode on his milk white horse,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.920] till he came to London town,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.040] and there he heard the church bells ring,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.320] and the people are morning round,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.160] and the people are morning round.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.280] Oh, what is a matter of love all sin?
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640] Oh, what is a matter said he,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.680] oh, ladies, Nancy's dead,

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.680] Some call her, lady, Nancy.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.720] So he ordered the grave to be open wine,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120] and shush out.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.320] Right.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.920] Right.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.360] Lady Nancy, she died as I might today.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.960] Lord love of He died too, Morrow.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.880] Lady Nancy, she died out of court court.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.480] Reward love of He died for sorrow.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.200] Lord love of He died of sorrow.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.960] Lady Nancy was laid, laid in the church.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960] Lord love of He was laid, set by her side,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.600] and out the fracuze and the gruel rose and a fur lover's own.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.720] Come on, can we?

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.560] and when they could grow no higher.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.280] So therein, twine that true lover's not for all their lovers
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.400] to admire for all their lovers to admire.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.520] This song was sung by a mother often requested
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.240] by many especially young folks.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.120] It's a real old one.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.160] All right.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.480] At Jones' house, Hospital,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.160] I saw my own doctor wrapped up in white flannel as cold as the clay.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.840] If it's first to the opera, then to the alhoves,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200] then to the dance of church next was the grave.

[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.280] Her lover, be guide her.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.560] They fled from my presence.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.560] The end you now see is here in the so cold.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.120] I fled the fate Terry,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.680] and that they should marry.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.160] She is here now forsaken as you now behold.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.280] Oh girls here take warning,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.280] behold my poor doctor,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.280] who met love a stranger so cunning and wise.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:03.000] He betrayed and soon left her as he did some others,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000] then in her angry she weakened and dying.
