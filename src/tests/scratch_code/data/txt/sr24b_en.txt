[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000] When a man says he knows women, I say there's no one at home.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000] You may read the sky and weather, but you never can read their dome.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000] They powder on the paint, you're the ones overthinking.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000] They would have everything to say, almost dead.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000] At the end of the strife suddenly they come to life and throw the rolling pin on at your head.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000] So boys keep away from the girls I say and give them lots of room.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000] For a mind when you wet they will bang it till you did with a ball head and end of the broom.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000] Experience I know is best so you must use your common sense.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000] You will find them big, greatest problem and what a terrible expense.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000] Like a Chinese puzzle there are multi-kenned mussel and you never can tell what is coming next.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000] They will get your little gold for the grab your hat and coat.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000] You will leave the house of war masala vets.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000] Yes they are fun, they let those things that they can't live with or live without.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000] And well they capture make their slaves, we like to have them about.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000] They may act like Christmas someone uses for tickets but they will all be forced into the same amount of sight.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000] For who would want a girl world whether it is men and girls for their being and want to start a fight.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000] So boys keep away from the girls I say and give them lots of room.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000] For mind when you wet they will bang it till you did with a ball head and end of the broom.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000] Just one penny.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000] In the street when winter's evening stood a little boy and said,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000] Just one penny please oh mister, just one penny to buy bread.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000] Just one penny's all I ask you, just one penny I know more.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000] God in him will surely bless you and perhaps increase your stew.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000] Dremling voice in clothes so tattered face so thin pathetic sand.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000] Yet imploringly he'd whisper just one penny to buy bread.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000] Father died when I a baby.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000] Mother worked help us to hold.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000] But in time her strength all left her.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000] And her often to us comes.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000] Just one penny's all I ask you, just one penny I know more.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000] God in him will surely bless you and perhaps increase your stew.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000] Now and then I'd sure for neighbors.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000] But we're often under thin.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000] Mother weeps I know she's failing and may die for one to bread.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000] Just one penny's all I ask you, just one penny I'll be saying.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000] Mother sick and much I worry that till die for one to bread.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000] Just one penny's all I ask you, just one penny I know more.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000] God in him will surely bless you and perhaps increase your stew.
