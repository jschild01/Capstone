[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400] She was set on the deckbox, the bearer or the hatch, anything but the cookroom she was
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.120] hard to match, and I have been run at the poor and the rich, but the jolly less bunch I have found
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.600] on the ditch, with them just the curds and all is placed there for someone's around who
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.800] will not take her there, or get everything and let them become one, and you know what their
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:41.360] life is an ocean of fun, when we would pass a boat or lay up for the night, she sure would get nervous
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.560] sometimes want to fight, if one would buck us then up on her air she was like a dry match, you could
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.920] eat these like fire, she always found for with a ballad and blade, this step stores on steam
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.240] hatch could have better been made, this turn swells would get her with laugh everyone,
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.920] pick a trip on the knall if you want to have fun, we had a few mask-out of the light that the
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.440] locks were our chickens, what others would fight, that takes they would scream rubber,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.560] the quick and get the pigeons would too show their colors and grit, all along we were welcome
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.040] a shower's in spring, and a night we had music with playyodlesing, my mind travels back to the
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.920] ditch went for a young, no place in the world as associations are fun, armules they were peppy,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.200] you should see them prints, the hardwater step they would gracefully dance, they noted this stuff
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.400] I would say they were trained, the voice of the drivers to them the refrain,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.920] our leader was wise for he knew many things he kept up the line of the cook she would sing,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.680] so all worked together what they've been make up, take a trip on the knall if you want to have fun,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.440] oh yes she was great always kept in the right, in meeting a boat let's to be day or night
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.120] if only our sighty would stop to line, we'd till it was clear they'd everything fine,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.080] you could call signal whistle he knew when we'd bay, and when he was hungry you showed
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.720] him brave, but the cook sure annoyed him at her he would run, she was yell like a tiger for him it was fun
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.520] she posed as the star always shining so bright she quit the size everything that came inside
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.720] this blow till her cool and thick buck could then change, the post-onches pose lines all gave her
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.000] pains, but we all kept moving no time for such stuff and knew she came out of it that was enough
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.360] in her estimation she was going some take a trip on the knall if you want to have fun
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000] the cook she's a day this is that gone on me she's firing red here there this sweet 63
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.120] they kept in the boat on the drivers yes oh just one look at her and they back with woodfall
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.160] her mind it is gone what she gave it the way and how many pieces she gave me each day
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120] she blinded and stabbed and she the dumpling up pet we're user for a headlight at night on the deck
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.000] we were up rough and ready with me then they think it was work fun and play we with dance yodel sing
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.640] no doubt we were clenish but that's not our fault the town they've got funny we did call her home
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:17.200] we met opposition aboard our home the knallers were famous for holding their own we lived our own life
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.840] was a gay easy one take a trip on the knall if you want to have fun
