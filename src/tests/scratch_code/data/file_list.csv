with great Perry where cannon's did roar.<lb></lb> Your valor has gained you an immortal glory,<lb></lb> A fame that shall last till time is no more.<lb></lb> Columbian tars are the true sons of Mars,<lb></lb> They rake fore and aft when they fight on the deep.<lb></lb> On the bed of Lake Erie, commanded by Perry,<lb></lb> They caused many Britons to take their last sleep.</p>             <p>The tenth of September let us all remember,<lb></lb> So long as the globe on her axis rolls round.<lb></lb> Our tars and marines on Lake Erie were seen,<lb></lb> To make the proud flag of Great Briton come down.<lb></lb> The van of our fleet, the British to meet,<lb></lb> Commanded by Perry, the Lawrence bore down.<lb></lb> Her guns they did roar with such terrific power,<lb></lb> That savages trembled at the dreadful sound.</p>             <p>The Lawrence sustained a most dreadful fire,<lb></lb> She fought three to one for two classes or more.<lb></lb> While Perry undaunted, did firmly stand by her,<lb></lb> The proud foe on every head broadside did pour.<lb></lb> Her masts being shattered, her rigging all tattered,<lb></lb> Her booms and her yards being all shot away.<lb></lb> And few left on deck to manage the wreck,<lb></lb> Our hero on board no longer could stay.</p>             <p>In this situation, the pride of the nation,<lb></lb> Sure heaven had guarded unhurt all the while.<lb></lb> While many a hero maintaining his station,<lb></lb> Fell close by his side and was thrown on the pile.<lb></lb> But mark you and wonder, when elements thunder,<lb></lb> When death and destruction are stalking all around.<lb></lb> His flag he did carry on board the Niagara,<lb></lb> Such valor on record was never yet found.</p>             <p>There is one gallant act of our noble commander,<lb></lb> While writing my song, I must notice with pride.<lb></lb> While launched in the boat that carried the standard,<lb></lb> A ball whistled thru her just close to his side.<lb></lb> Says Perry, “The rascals intend for to drown us,<lb></lb> But push on, my brave boys, you need never fear.”<lb></lb> And with his own coat, he plugged up the boat,<lb></lb> And thru fire and sulfur away he did steer.</p>             <p>The famous Niagara, now proud of her Perry,<lb></lb> Displayed all her banners in gallant array.<lb></lb> And twenty-five guns on her deck did carry,<lb></lb> Which soon put an end to this bloody affray.<lb></lb> The rear of our fleet was brought up complete,<lb></lb> The signal was given to break through the line.<lb></lb> While starboard and larboard and from every quarter,<lb></lb> The lamps of Columbia did gloriously shine.</p>             <p>The bold British lion roared out his last thunder,<lb></lb> When Perry attacked him close in the rear.<lb></lb> Columbia's eagle soon made him crouch under,<lb></lb> And roar out for quarter as soon you shall hear.<lb></lb> Oh, had you been there, I now do declare,<lb></lb> Such a site as you never had seen before.<lb></lb> Six ready blood flags, that no longer could wag,<lb></lb> All lay at the feet of our brave commodore.</p>             <p>Brave Elliot, whose valor must now be recorded,<lb></lb> On board the Niagara so well plays his part.<lb></lb> His gallant assistance to Perry afforded,<lb></lb> We'll place him the second on Lake Erie's chart.<lb></lb> In the midst of the battle, when guns they did rattle,<lb></lb> The Lawrence a wreck and the men most all slain.<lb></lb> Away he did steer and brought up the rear,<lb></lb> And by this maneuver the victory was gained.</p>             <p>Oh, had you but seen those noble commanders,<lb></lb> Embracing each other when the conflict was o'er.<lb></lb> And viewing all those invincible standards,<lb></lb> That never had yielded to any before!<lb></lb> Says Perry, “Brave Elliot, give me your hand, sir,<lb></lb> This day we have gained an immortal renown.<lb></lb> So long as Columbia Lake Erie commands, sir,<lb></lb> Let brave Captain Elliot with laurels be crowned.”</p>             <p>Great Briton may boast of her conquering heroes,<lb></lb> Her Rodney's, her Nelsons and all her whole crew.<lb></lb> But none in their glory have told such a story,<lb></lb> Nor boasted such feats as Columbians do.<lb></lb> The whole British fleet was captured complete,<lb></lb> Not one single vessel from us got away.<lb></lb> And present, some hundreds, Columbians wondered,<lb></lb> To see all them anchored moored out in our bay.</p>             <p>May heaven still smile on the
