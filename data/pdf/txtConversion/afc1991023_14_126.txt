TX01: 
MB:Not inside of the pines, you have the people there. 
JC:There's and old Russian community there, back from before the 
Russian revolution these people left Russia, so that's how far 
back it goes. 
They took great pains to 
let us know that they 
weren't communists. 
They said, "We're Russians, not communists" 
TB:When was that, 1917? 
MB:This 
is old fashioned molasses cake. 
They were his (TB's) mother's recipe (serving us). 
I made 'em 
fo r you. 
... 
JC: What would be nice would be 
if we could come 
down trapping with you when you set your lines... 
TB:That's what 
was nice when the teacher was here 
in February because I had the 
furs hanging in the fur shed. 
Not only that but I could point 
out the different grades of furs... the furs that was more 
valuable and the blue pelts that were least 
in value. 
EH:Do you trap furs 
in the marshes too, 
like muskrat (previous refer-
ence was to fox)? 
TB: Yes, the state meadow at Corbin City, and 
there's quite a few... 
One of the men that traps there 
is a 
state trooper, he has problems with a tumor or something, he can 
no 
longer do his job. 
He's still 
on the force, but he just rides 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 1 
with somebody else. But he still gets out there and traps, and 
it's a pity because he's such a wonderful man. 
I know he hit ice 
one day comin' around a bend in the river, and here was an 
ice 
floe. 
And he run the bow of the boat... crushed the whole bow, 
and he throwed his weight in the back, run her ashore, then he 
carried the motor a mile and a half across the marsh to shore. 
And 
it just happened that Bill Lee was still there and Bill 
brought him on home. 
But no, I love to trap the marshes, but the 
thing of 
it is, when I used to 
leave her of a morning, sometimes 
I'd 
leave here at 3:30 in the mornings to catch the morning tide, 
and my wife I know I was goin' out the door and 
it was down 
in 
the teens (temperature), and she said, "You must love this or 
you're a damn fool." 
I said, 
"A little bit of both," as I went 
out the door. 
But it's 
... 
Been trapping since 1921; I was 11 
years old when I started to trap. 
MB: And when I learned to bake 
I was about 18, comin' from the city. 
It was kind of hard. 
Then 
I started having children, and you know I'm going to tell you,, 
tasty cakes were only a nickel. 
But I didn't have a nickel, and 
I learned quick to cook and bake. 
Now, 
look what they are. 
They're 35 or 40 cents. 
And I learned to bake, cause I had three 
children. 
I really had to, I couldn't afford... And there was no 
cafeteria (at school) at that time for the children. 
I had to 
pack their lunch. 
And lunch meat was 5 cents a quarter. 
TB:They (who?) had the one daughter was a farmer (?)...had a 
beautiful home up there. 
MB: Pork chops were 3 cents a quarter. 
It's impossible. 
EH: 
Do your kids still 
live 
in this area? 
TB: The daughter up at the other end of the field. 
There's a house up on the far end (of the property his house 
is on) 
This 
is where I was born 73 years ago. 
And my brother sold 
it 13 years ago; he 
passed away, 
it'll 
be five years in May. 
He was a hunter, a 
woodsman. 
He tended my traps for me when I was small. 
I guess I 
was about 15 and working when he'd go an run the traps for me. 
Yes, he was my younger brother. 
He passed away 5 years ago. 
Richard Brown was his name. 
He was a great one for hunting deer. 
He'd sit all 
day, 
in fact, one time he sat till when he tried to 
stand he couldn't. 
It go to him... he just tightened up. 
He was 
a great hunter, but he didn't go for that trapping end of 
it. 
He 
take during the twenties. My father, he was against trapping, 
because he figured it was trifling. 
Then during the twenties, 
around about '24 when I was 14 and my mother started to sell 
the 
furs, and sometimes one fur'd bring more than a man could make 
in 
a day 
in wages. 
Then dad could see 
it, 
see. 
Course my father 
was 57 when I was born, and 61 when the youngest brother was 
born, with a sister in between us. 
Dad, he only had 5 weeks of 
schooling, but he was a well educated man. 
One thing he would 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
spend at an auction or a sale was all 
the books... and he would 
read 
'em. 
And he was well educated. 
Like I always say, I don't 
think I have the equivalence of five years (of education) because 
I skipped school so much to run 
in the woods. 
And we went with 
a horse and wagon to school. 
I think so (that it's an education 
itself in the woods). 
In the jamboree (of trappers) I took over 
for the Hudson Bay... Hudson Bay didn't show this year to the 
jamboree out here. 
So I took over and spoke, and that's the one 
thing I told 'em, that you've never lived till you been out there 
on a pond 
in the morning, just at the crack of dawn, and hear the 
slap of a beaver tail on the water or see the ripples of a 
muskrat. 
And I said I can remember an otter coming up, I said I 
don't know how old he was but his whiskers was grayer than mine. 
Treading water, I said, and then you see the sun come up, or 
if 
you're out there at night and see the moon rise, then you can 
believe there's a God above. 
And then I recited the trappers 
prayer for 'em. 
You'll see 
it (the text) when we go 
in the cabin 
(out behind his house). "God grant that I may trap until my dying 
day/ 
And when 
it comes to my 
last set I then most humbly pray/ 
That when I take the Lord's bait and I'm peacefully asleep/ He 
judges me a number one and good enough to keep." 
She used to say 
to me when I'd be goin' 
out the door, "...(deleted)" 
Bein' raised 
in the city from 9 to 14, she said "It must be awful 
lonesome in 
the woods." 
I answered,"No, 
its not lonesome, there's too much 
to see. 
Now this runs through my mind, and I made it up for her. 
"My wife 
is often said to me, "How lonesome the woods must be."/ 
I answered, "No, there's too much to see./ I love the murmur of 
the trees, as the wind softly stirs her leaves./ 
The bees flying 
to and fro/ gathering nectar as they go. / The robin and the 
little wren/ Among my many feathered friends./ The cardinal with 
his coat of red/ The mockingbird singing overhead./ At yonder log 
1 chance to glance/ a grouse is starting to drum and dance./ 
The 
otter from the bank it's slide/ The mink that hunts a hole to 
hide./ 
The deer that drink 
in yonder stream/ I often see them in 
my dreams./ And though folks may say it's a waste of time/ And 
though I may never be worth a dime/ I'll 
always have this love of 
mine." 
I make up a lot, but I usually don't write anything down. 
I can recite all day. 
... I don't know if you men would 
remember, back 
in the early '70's, an Indian was shot and killed 
in Philadelphia, Willie Shenandoah. 
He was a Mohawk Indian and 
served three hitches 
in Viet Nam. 
Then he was a foreman on 
steel, high steel at 17. 
He come up from New York state, and 
he'd come back from Viet Nam, and he was working on one of the 
skyscrapers in Philly. 
Well they were taking a movie, and the 
Indians are usually put 
in the poorest places, and I guess they'd 
been sleeping out on the fire escape and one of them kicked the 
mattress down into the street. 
where they were taking a movie. 
Well this officer rushed up and Shenandoah, being a foreman and 
chief, he barred the way, and he (the officer) pulled his 38 and 
he shot him five times. 
I was 
in the hospital the time 
it 
happened, I was having spinal surgery for an accident, and 
it 
really upset me, and what I wrote was this: "this land we call 
the 
land of the free/ it never did belong to you or me/ for the 
Indians were here before the White man come/ It was their land 
and 
it was their home/ And they hunted the buffalo/ and killed 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 3 
to survive/ and lived in teepees made of their hides/ The corn 
grew tall 
and the air was pure/ That's before White men landed on 
shore/ The rivers run clear and pure as could be/ And there was 
no fill 
(?) for pollution to see/ But that's the one thing I want 
to make clear/ That's before the White man got here/ Now the 
rivers are full 
of filth, the air with pollution/ And no one's 
come up with a possible solution/ The white man came 
in search of 
wealth and gold/ And the Indians were driven from hole to hole/ 
And when they fought back, wiped out some outpost or way station/ 
The cry went up, they're a curse to the nation/ So they were 
rounded up, hurried to a reservation/ And where are they now, 
this once proud red race and nation?/ They're still there, 
suffering from want, malnutrition./ Some races riot, others moan/ 
But with the Indian that lost their land and home/ Not long ago, 
in Philadephia, the so—called city of brotherly love/ An Indian, 
Roy Shenandoah, was shot for throwing a mattress from above/ The 
officer who shot him, so 
it 
is said/ Was protecting show people, 
to me not worth one hair of this Indian's head/ And why 
is 
the 
others, the same as his brothers?/ It's the same damn deal/ 
Six 
months to five years in our stinking jail/ So sometimes, and I 
turn my face to the rain/ And thank God for the few drops of 
Indian blood still 
in my veins." 
MB: That is really something, he mad that up. 
That is beautiful. 
JC: So you're of Indian descent then? 
TB: My mother was half. 
MB: That's why he 
loves the Indians 
TB: 
You take our children. 
We have a 
granddaughter in South Carolina, she was 
in the Navy, and when 
she gets to ride around in a little Volkswagon beetle, and on the 
back she has a bumper sticker, "Custer had 
it coming." 
But 
she... 
EH: 
I've been working with some Indian people out in 
Washington State... 
TB:You haven't been over here to Gouldtown, 
have you. 
Well those people over there, my father, being his 
129th year... This should be off the record, they ... mostly 
they's white, the blood that's in them. 
They do have a lot of 
white blood, as far as the Indian, I doubt it very much, because 
Dad said, where these girls worked and become pregnant, and that 
they were the offspring of very wealthy people. 
But they have 
their powwows, and the government recognized them as the Delaware 
Indians. 
But the Delaware Indians doesn't recognize them, no 
way. 
EH: The Delawares are in Oklahoma... 
TB: Yeah, my 
grandfather, he was a basket maker, he would split the white oak, 
you know, and weave the baskets. 
That was my mother's father. 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 4 
EH: 
Are there any Indian people still trapping around this area? 
TB: No, as far as I know there's none around anywhere. 
JC: 
How many trappers would you say there are in this area? 
TB:In this area I would say ... in the state there's over 4000. 
And 
I'm an instructor for the state. 
I don't do as much now because the 
younger one's is taking over, but I like to go, get the 
youngsters to come here, then I'll give them instruction right 
here. 
But I would say there 4000+ in the state now, 
in this 
area, the southern counties, 3/4 of the trappers are 
in this 
area. 
We do have a lot of trappers. 
EH: 
Is 
it 
like a hobby with some people, or do they make their liv— 
ing? 
TB: No, this 
is a big thing, a lot of them don't like to say what 
they catch, income tax, you know, but a lot of these people are pay 
ing for tractos and taxes on their farm and stuff just on what they 
make. 
I know for a fact that a lot of them all 
run better than 
10,000 dollars a year. 
There's carpenters,... they'll take there 
time, and that's their livelihood. 
They have their meadow. 
With 
the fur... and this 
is what the Anti's don't understand... this 
is a renewable resource. 
Over the years, since I started 
in 
1321, except for loss of habitat, and the bulldozers, housing 
developments, due to good conservation officers and conservation 
law, we have more fur now than when I was a boy., 
There is some 
mistakes that they make, 
like spraying the meadows. 
And they 
spray to kill the cattails so that they can have more of the 
three—square grass (sedge?:EH) for the ducks, and when these 
muskrats eat that, they die. 
That's cost us a lot of muskrat. 
EH: Do you know what chemical they spray for that? 
TB: No, I 
don;'t. 
They kill 
the cattails.. 
It's what we call 
"three 
square." It has three sides. 
The ducks feed on that, so they 
spray 
in the spring 
in the pond. 
Where I used to take a lot of 
muskrats, with houses (muskrat) and cattails; there's nothing 
there now. 
Just an island for the ducks to feed on. 
But they 
say you can't have ducks and mushrats both. 
But the mushrats 
was there first. 
Along with the ducks before. 
And they used to 
take thousands of them out of there. 
EH: 
What are the main animals 
in your trapping business? 
TB: Fox, coon, and rats, 
muskrats. 
Oh yeah, there's beaver left, plenty of beaver. 
See, 
you have to have a permit for the beaver. 
I like to see them; I 
don;'t bother with the beaver at all. 
I caught one, cost me a 
$100 fine, where it was drownded, see. 
And my boy at that time 
was 12 years old, and he was doing a little taxidermist work, and 
he wanted to tan 
it. 
So my brother—in—law said, throw it up on 
the back of the truck, take 
it home and skin 
it out, 
let him tan 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
it. 
So I did. 
Well the next Sunday I caught two mink, so I put 
the beaver hide between the mink on the back door and I showed 
the picture, and that's all 
she wrote cause I got a fine. 
They 
turned me 
in to 
'em. 
They saw the picture and that was 
it, 
they 
came knockin' on the door. 
EH: How did they see the picture? 
TB:I showed it to a fella and he turned me 
in. 
... The mink 
is 
just about a thing of the past now through pollution. 
A mink 
likes pure streams, and she could tell you, even thirty years ago 
you could lean down and get a drink of water anywhere in these 
streams. 
Now if you want water you got to take 
it with you. 
Can't drink the water. 
it's polluted so bad. 
I caught five 
mink, the highest was five one day, but I got over a little 
stream over here, I caught four in four days, same set. 
I reset 
it and every morning I had a nice mink 
in there. 
EH: All part of the same family? 
TB: I imagine they were out of the same Iitter. 
That was 
in the early fifty's I'd say. 
I haven't caught a mink, 
in fact I don't try to catch mink anymore because I would rather 
leave 'em alone, and I see a mink track I'm gonna steer away from 
i 
t, 
try to 
EH: 
Will a mink come to a rat set? 
TB: Yeah, so 
you might catch one by mistake, that'd be the only way. 
Usually 
a mink is pretty shy, he will avoid the muskrat sets. 
I caught 
most of the mink in flying sets, you know where they come up and 
down, and that's where I would trap. One place back here, Manaco 
Samwise (?), I used to take mink out of there every year. 
There's still mink there, but you put a trap down and I dare say 
within two hours it would be gone; somebody would have it. 
And 
then I parked my truck here three years ago back there... I have 
a four—wheel drive Dodge... and I had a trunk bolted down, 
iron— 
bound trunk, 
... I come back, that trunk was open. 
I lost a $160 
worth of fox traps out of 
it. 
But they had pried it open and got 
the traps, 
EH:: Who's doing that ? 
TB: 
In every group you will 
find some people are that way. 
Now, there 
is people, 
professional people, that would take a fox out of a trap and 
release it 
if 
it was alive. 
And there is people that, 
if 
you 
lost your wallet, 
it would be returned with everything in 
it. 
But, fur 
is a different thing, they figure if a fur is there, 
they don't think of 
it as stealing 
if 
they take 
it see. 
But 
these here, these ones that steal your traps, we pretty near know 
who they are, but provin' 
it 
is another thing. 
They call 
'em, 
"Johnny Sneak—ems." 
because they sneak along behind you, and you 
lose your traps. 
They do definitely trap themselves, because 
when they stole my traps, the one thing that hurt me more than 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 6 
anything, ... my grandson had given me a little pair of cutters, 
to cut wire... and they were gone, and I';d had them since he was 
about nine years old. 
That hurt. 
But then I had a bucket of 
bait, a little small bucket with a lid on it, 
and they even took 
the bait. 
So they must have figured the bait would come in 
handy. 
They took that too. 
They heard me comin' and the worst 
of 
it was, 
it might have been a good thing cause I was carrying 
a rifle, and 
if they'd been 
in the back of that truck, 
.... 
I've 
always been taught, growin' 
up, never fool with a young boy or an 
old man. 
The young boy don't know any better,, and the old man 
don't give a damn. 
And I'm up there in them years. 
That's the 
story. 
Just three years ago (it happened). 
It (stealing) has 
been a problem, but I wouldn't say it's getting any worse. 
In 
fact I think it's getting better, because, right now you cannot 
get a trapping license unless you go through the course. 
That's 
the one thing we are teaching these youngsters, they're 
interested 
in 
it, 
you tell them about it, 
leaving other people's 
property alone. 
I think 
it goes over with them, 
that's the 
time... These other ones, some of them, they been caught, 
in 
fact, one of them was caught with the troopers traps. 
He got out 
of 
it, but his buddy was fined $30. 
Thirty dollars isn't 
anything because you take $30, only covers one dozen traps. 
Some 
of the boys have lost them by the hundreds. 
We have our name 
right on them., 
We have name tags... that's a state law. 
They 
know whose traps they're taking, and they just don';t care. 
On a 
lot of traps I put my initials with a stamp. 
But still and all, 
it 
is a job to ever locate those traps again. If you happen to 
catch them it would be a different thing. 
Yes, we (have our 
territories), 
like down on the state meadow, I trap here. 
Then 
old Bill Lee (traps) here. 
Over further will be my cousin and be 
different one that come 
in, Frank Hays, 
... Yeah, we'd pick and 
area and we 'd go right on out... 
No, we don't sit down and talk 
it out, we just go out and stake. 
When I see Bill Lee's stakes, 
I stay maybe 20-30 yards away from him, and he usually does the 
same... not always (chuckle). 
EH:First come first served? 
TB:No, anybody can come 
in there. 
Even after I set, 
if you have a 
license you can come 
in a set right amongst mine. 
There's no law 
against it. 
But usually 
if 
you see where it's stake up, we avoid 
it. 
I took the group down there last spring, from Newport 
school,, and we went in on the dikes. 
I showed 'em where I 
caught my 400th rat, but the 400th rat weren't no good because 
the sea gulls got there first. 
And boy them things can tear 
things up too. 
So I took them out and I showed them an otter 
trail, where the otter comes up. 
That's another thing I don;t 
bother with, otter. 
I could get a permit, possibility of getting 
a permit, but I'd rather see them. 
In 1952 I set for one down 
there 
in Dennisville, at Skeeter Point, had to cross logs. 
When 
the water was high the logs would roll under your feet. 
The 
otter must have heard me coming. END SIDE 1 OF AEH001.

TB:...Mary Fisher's class - her husband's a trapper. 
He's 
trapped a lot of furs 
GH:Is this the public school , private school? 
TB:Yeah. It was through Rita I went into the schools, 
in Mary 
Fisher's class and Van Enden's class, 
in Millville. But anyhow, 
when I went down there, 
these youngsters... 
it's 
surprising 
because out at the jamboree, one little girl come along and her 
mother said, "Tom, she was 
one of your classes down to Newport 
- school, Down Elementary" and I looked at her and I said 
"Laurie Burke". 
And her father broke out laughing, burst out 
laughing, 
'cause he didn't think, you know, I'd remember her. So 
I wrote this here for the kids and I give'em 
each a copy: "In 
Down Township Elementary School, teacher Mrs. Mary Fisher, has a 
class of 27. To have a class like this must seem like heaven. 27 
names, 
take one at a time, I'll 
do my best to make them rhyme. 
How many classes have three Michelles? Phillips, Kinglan and 
more? Add Cindy Blither I now have four. So far I'm doing all 
right, so I add the name of Bud Burnight. Five I have here - add 
Laura Miller and 
April Lamathere. 
Jack Smith and Nancy R. Wild 
and John Angelo Ricci, the boy with a smile. 
I guess I'm doing 
so-so-- here 
is Andri Rosato. 
The girl with the braid - Tracy 
Park - I talked with her for quite a spell. 
So here

Steven A. Lewis and his art - the picture and I will

I'm getting tired, my eyes they hurt. 
So here

I'll finish this if 
it takes all 
night, so here

I'm trying to use the old bean - I give you

Dorothy Nuttle, this makes me smile — she's Anne Slimmer's 
grandchild. 
My eyes they seem full 
of sand, here's John 
Kingsland. This has been a lot of fun, here's Alonzo Forman. 
Jean Williams, I guess I will have to add Tommy Lewis. 
I very 
near forgot, heaven be praised, a wonderful person, Miss Mary 
Beth Graves. 
Last but not least, I did not forget, my special 
friend, her name is Lynnette. 
(This little girl can't talk 
hardly) 
And now to a wonderful person and marvelous teacher, 
none other than our Mary Fisher." 
So I give each one of the 
youngsters a copy of that. 
GH: 
Have you always made rhymes like this? 
TB: 
Always been gifted for making up--
MB: 
Not too much until 
lately — about the last ten years. 
TB: 
No, I always had the ability. 
MB: 
Oh, that's right, we went on the bus trip. 
Would you wanta 
recite the one you made up for King? 
TB: 
For who? 
MB: 
Right on the bus trip — I was so upset--
GH: 
I bet he would--
TB: 
Which one's that? 
MB: 
The King, Luther King. 
TB: 
Oh. Well, I'll 
tell 
you, 
like you said about the Russians 
wanting to beat — well, we have a picture, my sister has, of 
Martin Luther right in a communist school. 
And he's right in 
the front line — they got a circle around him. 
It was out of 
Look. 
Years ago, out of Look magazine. 
MB: 
Anybody wants to see 
it, 
she says can see it. 
TB: 
But, I had no use for him because I figured he had to take 
the Negroes and got 'em all 
riled up and then he backed out. 
Well, that's the way the communists take over from within 
anyhow. 
So, said I have Colored friends. 
I have Colored people 
come here and sit down and eat with me and all, and I don't 
think that...well, let's put it this way... 
GH: 
Are there any Colored trappers? 
TB: 
Yeah, a there's a few. 
MB: 
Not too many. 
TB: 
And I have Colored people come here and buy the raccoon and 
muskrat meat. 
But they came 
in, 
they sit down and have coffee, 
and cake. 
But Martin Luther, 
like I said, and it kind of griped 
me to think they tryin to have a holiday for him. 
But she came 
out in the yard, and she said — does this go on the tape too? 
GH: 
Want me to turn 
it off? 
TB: 
I think 
it would be better maybe... 
TB: 
One thing I always say, 
is never complain about growing 
old. 
Too many's denied the privilege. 
GH: Well, how old are you? 
TB: 73. 
GH: And Muriel? 
MB:I'm 69...69, and still going strong. No, I very seldom get 
sick. 
TB: I was born September the fourth, 1910. 
MB: And then they say, don't use salt, don't use this, don't use 
that — we use everything. No, we don't use lard. I used to do 
all 
my cooking with lard, my pie crusts and everything, but I do 
get Crisco. My daughter said "Mother you got to do away with 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 10 
that because it's bad for you" 
TB: The main thing I think is 
MB: I love to travel 
TB: --having something to 
look forward to do every day. I think 
a person will 
live much longer if they have something to do 
every day. I always have plenty of work for weeks ahead. 
Tomorrow I'll 
be 
in the woods. Tomorrow I'll 
be 
in the woods 
with a chain saw. 
Getting wood. We burn wood all winter long. 
we've always done 
it — we've never had nothing but wood heat. 
MB: 50 years. Now that's all 
the style. 
TB: Better add another year to that, kid. 
GH: Where do you get your wood? 
TB: Well,I'm cuttin out here — now you have to have a permit, 
unless you own the wood. 
But I'm going in where the wind storm 
knocked a lot of my wood down. 
GH: 
In a state forest or? 
TB: No, this 
is my own wood. 
GH: What kind of wood do you... 
TB: Oak. All 
oak. 
MB: We got nine acres now. We give our daughter an acre and she 
built a lovely home up there. 
GH: I was wondering, with all 
the pine up there, nobody seems to 
burn pine. 
MB: Wait till you see out back, I think you're gonna like 
it. 
TB: Pine is a fast burning. And some states they burn pine, but 
it all has to be split. 
If you don't split it and season — dry 
it, 
it gets all waterlogged and worms get under the bark. 
If 
you split it, 
it'll make — but it burns so fast. 
But you take 
with the oak, 
you know, 
it's long lasting. Oak, 
hickory, 
all 
the hardwoods. 
GH: 
Is 
it hard to get the oak started? Do you have to... 
TB: Not with seasoned, you see the wood out here's all 
seasoned. 
wood. And then I have wood piled, racked up 
in the cellar. But 
we have a big fire—box on the heater. 
GH: 
In the basement? 
TB: Yeah, 
in the basement. Hot air, 
I'll 
tell you... 
GH: We have a pot—bellied stove in our living room at home. We 
just turn off the gas furnace 
TB: Where s your home at? 
GH: Seattle. 
TB: Oh, you're 
in Seattle? 
GH: Yeah, I just came out day before yesterday. 
TB: Oh my golly, I got a friend right out from there, out to 
Loon Lake. Not too far, Spokane. 
GH: Oh yeah, I know where that is 
TB: Yeah, he was former game commissioner here. He lives right 
there on Loon Lake. Umhm, he 
left here 
in 
'75, I haven't saw him 
since '75. Tony Delgado — he had a mink ranch here. He raised 
mink — he raised, he pelted three thousand a year when he had 
that. Then he took the choice ones and then he had wraps made up 
and he had his own showroom and everything. 
MB: Does it really get real 
cold there in the winter? 
TB: Sometimes they have better winters than what we do 
GH: 
It depends. Over by Loon Lake, near Spokane, you re kind of 
in 
the Rocky Mountains. Gets down 20, 30 below sometimes. Oh 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 11 
that looks wonderful. 
MB: Everything Tom raised in 
this soup 
GH: 
Is that from your garden? 
MB: Yes, everything, the tomatoes 
GH: So what's in this soup? 
MB: Tomatoes -- outside the potatoes,I'm not gonna lie cause we 
didn't raise the potatoes. The corn, the beans, the tomatoes 
TB: And we've had problems here in the 
late years raising 
potatoes on account of we don't have anything that'll kill 
the 
potato beetles. 
MB: He does have yams. 
TB: 
I think 
next 
year 
if 
I'm 
around I'm 
gonna 
try 
to 
grow potatoes again, because the last few years I grow 'em these 
people over in here, they wouldn't spray nothing. And you could 
see an army of bugs coming to my garden. So I had to quit raisin 
'em. 
Yeah, 
it's uh... 
GH: We have potatoes 
in our back yard. My wife has a garden. 
They just keep coming back year after year. 
MB: They were wonderful when he could raise 'em. Big redstone... 
TB: I have yams planted out there - I have two rows of yams. But 
I had tomatoes up to two and a half pound this year. I have 
raised 'em to three pound. 
GH: 
Is that because the hot weather this summer? 
MB: Yeah. 
TB: 
Well, 
we had a lot of dry weather - I put water on most 
everything out there, but the , the lima beans have been really 
wonderful this year. 
GH: 
Is that the main bean you grow - limas? 
TB: 
Well, the watermelons it hit hard, 
the 
watermelons and 
cantaloupes, and then we did start to get a few and then the 
deer hit 'em. Hit 'em hard. But I had some nice Jenny Lind 
cantaloupes. 
MB: 
I've got 15 quart jars 
TB: She's got her tomatoes, couple quarts she just brought out. 
She tomatoes and jam. 
GH:I'm curious about raccoon - how much 
is a raccoon skin? 
TB: Raccoon. Last year they run around 18 to 25 dollars. But 1 
had the highest, 35 dollars for one. 
MB: This 
is what I do 
in the summer. I did 54 jars of those and 
then peach jam. 
GH: Fantastic. 
MB: He loves peach jam. And he doesn't like anything bought in 
the store. And I don't like the price. A dollar twenty-nine for 
that and it's got all preservatives in 
it. 
This is real. 
JC: Are any of those animals you trap good to eat? 
TB: The raccoon and the muskrat. The muskrat we've been selling 
in 
late years, we've used to sell 
'em 
GH: Muriel won't eat muskrat. 
TB: No, she doesn't. I do. 
GH: What's it taste like? 
TB: 
Muskrat. I'll 
tell 
you they're better than rabbit - much 
better. They re a moist meat. I like 'em fried nice and brown. 
There's demand - you can sell every one you catch. 
GH: How much meat do you get off a muskrat? 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 12 
TB: A muskrat — meat will run a pound or better, that is a fair 
size muskrat. Full grown. 
MB> Take three for a family, say. 
TB: But I can't get away, myself, I can't get away with a whole 
muskrat. I would say the hind legs and the saddle — the back— is 
about all I can eat. 
MB: That's all 
but two little teeny legs. 
TB: Anyhow, the muskrats we used to sell three for a dollar. And 
I can remember back when my mother bought 'em off of Billy 
Fisher and Frank Fisher — two old trappers, they'd be way over a 
hundred now 
and 
we used to go out there and get 'em for a 
nickel apiece. The carcasses. 
MB: Well, I raised the price — fifty cents apiece and that's 
cheap. 
That's how much you sell them for now? 
MB: And 
in the market they're a dollar, dollar and a quarter. 
JC: Fifty cents for a pound of meat, that's good. 
MB: I said you're not selling them no more, no more for three 
for a dollar. I feel stupid telling those people, I'm gonna 
raise my price up. I saved the money too. I keep the money. 
GH: So you get the money from selling the meat? 
MB: 
It isn't that much — fifty four dollars Ist year. 
TB: The raccoon run three to five dollar a carcass. Mostly 
colored people. 
JC: Do you all 
eat muskrat or raccoon? 
MB: Not me. 
TB: I eat the muskrat. The raccoon I used to 
MB: Deer, he used to hunt, when we were first married. When he 
got a deer out here — it was a big thing you know. For our 
livelihood, for the family. 
GH: Why 
is 
it ? You just don't like the taste of that meat or is 
it just the idea of 
it? 
MB: I never tasted muskrat cause they remind me of a rat. 
TB: And they don't look nothing like a rat. 
MB: He says you're stupid, don't look nothing like a rat. 
TB: No, a muskrat — to me a muskrat is a beautiful animal. 
MB: And yet, 
I'll fix'em, I'll fix 'em for him and they look 
delicious. He says they're better than roast beef. 
JC: Can you give us a recipe for it? 
MB: Oh sure. Now I soak 'em overnight in salt water. That takes 
all 
that — half of 
it anyway — wild taste out. Then, I drain 'em 
in a colander. 
JC: How salty is the water? 
MB: I salt the water, I couldn't tell 
you, 
JC; Like a handful? 
MB: Oh no, a tablespoonful. About a tablespoonful, when you re 
cooking it. And you parboil'em, with onions, plenty of onions — 
about 
three 
nice 
size 
onions. 
And 
you cook them 
for 
three— quarters of an hour. 
I mean boil — not too fast, medium 
Then you take'em out, put'em on a platter, cut'em up — that's 
what I do when I'm here alone, but Tom cuts'em if 
he knows I 
want'em, the night before. I can't handle'em. And then I take my 
Crisco out and I flour'em like you would chicken — well fry 
it 
just like you would chicken that's all I can say. Then we have a 
Italian friend, she makes a sauce, 
a Italian sauce and put 
over'em after they're fried and he likes'em that way too. The 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 13 
colored people loves'em. 
And the raccoon. 
GH: You don't like raccoon? 
MB: No, I wouldn't eat it. Feed that stuff to the dog, I can't 
stand it. You would think that we wouldn't get along cause we're 
different, so different. But if you re both too much alike you'd 
think you get in each other's hair maybe. I take care of my home 
and my cooking and 
let him go. I have friends come out to pick 
me up — I go off to the mall and go shopping — I just don't 
stick here. But I'm always here when he comes home, you know. 
TB: 
The raccoon is so fat — but 
if you take that fat off and 
then roast'em with yams or sweet potatoes, they're really good. 
Raccoon tastes like pork. They re really good. And pork 
is 
something, unless I raise it myself, I can't eat. 
JC: You have to roast them to 
let the fat drip off? 
TB: Well, you cut most of that fat off. You trim it, 
you know. 
GH: Do the raccoons come up to your door here? 
TB: Yes they do. I can show you--today I imagine I can show you 
raccoon tracks out there on the ground. 
MB: A skunk comes right up here. They al

out. But you know what I found out by reading 
in the paper, I 
can't believe it — you open up a jar of fresh—preserved tomatoes 
that you just canned. Leave the lid off 
it and set it on your

it'll take out all 
the scent. Now that's something don't 
cost them nothing. I try that sometime — my husband comes home 
and used to catch the darned things. 
He'd stink, I couldn't 
live with him hardly, 
it was horrible. What he done. So, this 
day he come home and I said I want to try these tomatoes. So he 
washed his hands with the tomatoes and then they took all 
the 
odor off. 
The tomatoes. 
TB: Oh yeah, we used the tomatoes to take the scent off. Now, 
this 
is a one and a half. This 
is what we're using now for. 
This 
is the trap, and that's the thing 
— your friend in there — 
this 
is what happens, see. Now this 
is the size of trap most of 
the trappers are using and this is what the people holler about, 
danger to children. See that. I can't pull my hand out of there 
— and this 
is what the anti — now I can.t hardly get out of 
that. See, 
gonna make a blood blister. And that — well, see 
that's where we argue with the.. 
GH: 
Is this how you do 
it? 
TB: No, 
I'll show you how we set'em. 
GH: Now you'll bait those right on top? 
TB: No bait. You don't put no bait — it's illegal 
to put bait — 
exposed bait. This trap will be covered with sand. You have a 
hole dug 
in 
like a fox would dig. Your bait is down in that hole 
out of sight. But lotta times we don't use bait, just eye 
appeal. 
Fox urine and lure. But this... 
GH: Eye appeal, 
lure and fox urine? 
TB: Yeah, eye appeal 
is what we call, when you dig the hole — 
the, 
dirt's throwed out, so that makes a eye appeal or 
sometimes we'll put feathers or eggshells, piece of fur. So 
that's one trap. Now, I'm showing you the biggest trap we re 
allowed to use. Here s another one. This, you see this one's all 
whacked — this I use for raccoon, with a long chain. You 
stake'em in { ) deep water. 
But see these here are hair 
trigger. 
GH: That's more powerful than the other one? 
TB: No 
GH: That's a number 15? 
TB: This 
is a number 2. Both of'em are number twos. Goes off 
real 
easy. 
GH: 
Is there a special name for this kind of trap? 
TB: This 
is a Victor number 2 long spring. That's a Victor one 
and a half coil spring. Now I can't get out of that unless I put 
it down. Like this. Now here's one bigger 
GH: Usually does it break the animal's leg or just hold it? 
TB: Actually, they call'em leg hold traps. They are not leg 
hold. 
They are foot hold traps. Because you take when an animal 
steps on there, you get him right up across the pad. Well you 
know yourself if we go out here and we go round 
in the snow with 
our hands they'd be frozen in just a short time. Where an 
animal, his paw, he has that heavy pad, that fur, and they can 
walk 
in the hot desert sand or 
in snow and stuff like that and 
it don.t bother'em. So when they're caught — lotta times when we 
catch a fox — she could tell 
you, she's been with me — the fox 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 15 
is asleep. 
Curled with his tail 
up over his... they put their 
tail 
up over their nose, you know, and they'll 
lay there. And 
I'll 
tell you, 
they eat the bait after they dig 
it out, after 
they're caught. 
MB: They just walk away. 
TB: When we get,back in the cabin I'll show you. 
GH: So 
it doesn't look 
like they're in pain? 
MB: Nah, they don't feel nothing. They re just laying there. 
TB: No. 
I'll 
tell you why 
it 
is - see now this is the one we're 
getting away from. Now this 
is a number two. That's a... 
JC: So they're usually alive when you catch'em then? 
TB: Yeah, 
in the trap. This 
is the thing we argue. With this 
trap we can release the animal. Now with the killer trap you 
can't release. And would you believe it, 
in a live box trap the 
animal 
is worse off than he 
is 
in one of these - because he's 
trapped in there and he's got a chance to run back and forth and 
they really worry themselves practically to death. Well with 
this here, no problem. Now, this 
is the thing. If you get some 
kid or somebody - we have a few in the organization, they don't 
tend their traps - then 
it's 
a different story, 
see. 
I know 
I sprung a trap accidentally one time and I looked down and 1 
pulled it up enough to get the tag and then I covered it up so 
when he come back nobody would steal his trap. And that trap was 
there for eleven days before he come got it. So you can tell 
right there. And he had other traps that, you know, after I 
found the one 1 could look through and I could see the artifi 
ial 
sets there. 
MB: Disgusting. 
TB: 
Now this trap that the - here 
in Salem, three weeks ago 
Wednesday it was - why, she set a brand new one, Sue Russell, 
and 
after she got it set - she had a job, I wanted to go up and 
set it for her and the boy said "Leave her alone, she knows what 
she's doing. She had to put her feet on here, you know push on 
that - finally she got it set. 
MB: Boy she was mad. She was mad. 
TB: And she sat like from here across the aisle from me, and she 
said "Now let one of the brave trappers come up and put their 
hand 
in 
it." There was a stampede. I was the second on the 
stage, 
and Bill Renshaw already had his hand 
in the trap. Then 
he walked away with her trap, made her come get it. Later, you 
know. So when she come back down - oh, 
it shook her up so bad 
that she just got off of what she wanted to say and 
MB: She was very mad 
TB: So when she.. 
GH: 
Is she one of the leaders of the antis? 
TB: Yeah. 50,000 dollars a year. Sue Russell 
MB: God awful. No wonder she's worried. Don't do anything. It's 
a shame. 
GH: $50,000 a year, that's 
TB: This 
is the kinda trap she had. And once she come back and 
set down 
in her seat I said "Lady, that one backfired on you." 
GH: Are there any women trappers? 
TB: Oh yeah. We have one 
in Georgia that'll rub you around 
25,000 a year. Now that's pretty good. Vivian Pryor. She's the 
head of the Georgia trappers. But this trap here, I'll show you 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 16 
this one here. This one here will sting. This 
is a number two 
Victor coil — but we're going to this one, ( ) like this. Now, 
if 
you went this way, see, now it wouldn't make no difference 
with an animal, 
but your hand, chances are 
it would come up and 
give you a blood blister. You go down like this, see, with your 
hand 
in between the jaws. 
GH: Let me try with that one and a half there. 
TB: Go right down between the jaw, just like that. 
MB: I wish you luck. 
TB: Hit her hard. See. Ahhh. 
MB: Oh. Does it hurt? 
GH: 
No not too bad. Let me try and set it. 
TB: Put it on your knee. Go down real fast with it. 
GH: Like this? 
TB: Yeah 
MB: Boy, you gotta be a strong man, don't you. 
TB: Then you bring the dog up over. You got her. Now see, when 
you set, then you take your trowel and you push the dog 
in 
like 
this. 
GH: the dog is. 
TB: This is the dog. This 
is 
the pan and this 
is the dog. See 
how level 
it 
is now? You gotta bed'em down so they don't rock. 
If that rocks, the animal will 
pull back right away, soon's he 
feels anything giving under his foot. Most of the time we get'em 
right across the paw. 
GH: You bury 
it just down level? 
TB: You bury that down and you have about that much dirt over 
it. 
What we usually do, we got a cap now that goes over'em, 
see. And 
than you put the dirt, sift the dirt, and then you 
pull 
the cap off and that leaves just the pan. Then you just 
sift a little dirt over that. The dirt is packed. But see, the 
way we usually spring'em is 
like this. 
GH; What are the parts of 
it? 
TB: These are the jaws. These are the springs here, see, and 
this 
is the dog. And this 
is the pan 
Now this is another one 
in 
here. 
This is what we have to have for our muskrats. When you 
go out I'll show you. I believe I got traps in the cellar — I'll 
have to 
look and see. This is the number one stop loss. This is 
the stop loss here. When you set the trap you bring it up 
like 
that. You put this here over like this. Now this 
is the thing we 
have to have for our muskrat trapping. It's a delayed action. 
You put this 
through here, 
see. 
When the 
muskrat gets 
caught, 
this springs and then as he pulls, this comes out, this 
comes up and 
holds him. Muskrat, their front leg 
is very 
fragile. And they don't chew'em off, but they twist'em off. But 
this 
is the thing that we really have to have to keep our trap. 
This thing here — I always make sure it ain't gonna come up and 
hit my finger — that really whacks — so this 
is what happens. 
See, this springs like that and when this here pulls out here, 
that comes over. 
Sometimes it'll 
kill even. But this holds the animal so he can't 
twist his 
leg off. But this 
is the trap! now — the regular steel 
trap unless you set to drown, he won't be 
in there long. And 
they're just as healthy, you'll catch'em with both front feet 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 17 
gone and they're just as healthy as can be. 
GH: Cause they swim rather than walk? 
TB: Mmhm. 
GH: What do they call that? 
TB: The Victor stop- loss. 
GH: What do you call this piece? 
TB: That's the stop-loss. That's the guard, comes over and 
hoIds'em. 
GH: And then number one 
is what you use on muskrat then? 
TB: Yeah. Number one. 
GH: And number one and a half for fox and raccoon? 
TB: Yeah, fox and coon and the number two, fox. Now this is a 
good coon trap, because your stake - I've even had a beaver that 
I released out of one of these - because the beaver couldn't get 
enough tension to pull 
it 
loose, see. So I catch a lot of coon 
in these. And these here, I just bought, all 
new chain, and I'm 
gonna put new chain on'em, because I don't like the idea of an 
animal breaking loose, you know, with a trap on 
its foot. This 
is my name right here - see, that's my name tag. 
GH: Do you have to have a special 
license or something, attached 
to your 
TB: Yeah, 
my mother used to, 
in the spring of the year, the 
sassafras, years ago that was like a tonic. 
GH: You find a big tree or just a little one? 
TB: No, just a little one - the little ones, yeah, you can 
pull'em right up. I got'em out there in the blueberry patch. 
GH: Now what.s this teaberry 
TB: Teaberry? That's - I'll 
show them to you when we go back to 
the cabin -I might even be able to find some teaberries 
The 
grouse clean them. You know, while we been setting here talking, 
the squirrels, my squirrels has come up. See that, see the hulls 
out there on that bench? They did that since you were here. See 
them on the bench there? 
GH: We could go for a walk around. Want to do that now? 
TB: Yeah. 
MB: 
It was so beautiful this morning. 
GH: I can carry this machine with me. So I won't miss anything. 
Want to go for a walk, Joe, out around the back yard? 
TB: There.s so much to see out here. 
MB: 
I'll 
tell you what I'd like to do. Like to open up the place 
for people to see, you know. But he said he wouldn't be able to. 
You know, you wouldn't have nothing left. (exit house) I can't 
be cook - -
TB: 
In the summer here, 
look how high these here cosmos would 
have been. See, this 
is 
the garden out here. Used to farm this 
by hand, all 
the way clean to where that little Volkswagon is 
there. 
These 
are 
all 
outside. 
Look 
in 
there 
I got  
 
through 
the windows there. Look at the blooms on the cactus. 
There's the flowers. Yeah, I have all kinds of cactus in there 
... 
(recording problems) 
TB: And then, Grant Trader, one taught me to set snooze, the 
other taught me to set snares. But they were both experts. You 
see, the snares we baited, the snooze we didn't. But that knife 
was given to me for my twelfth birthday. 
GH: Snooze you said? Snares and snooze? 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 18 
TB: Yeah. A snoo is set 
in an animal's path. Most people today 
would call 
it a snare. Now, a lot of people would give me an 
argument on this, but this is the way I was taught. A snoo 
is 
with the pole, that flips the animal 
in the air. When he 
triggers it - other words, say here's a notch cut here, and a 
pole comes over with another notch, 
it fastens here. Then the 
wire hangs over the animal's path. When he hits that wire, he 
pulls this notch apart, 
the spring pole flips him in the air. 
Now with a snare, the way I was taught, you make a round pin, 
like, and then the pole comes over and 
it latches in here, you 
have like a "U" pushed down 
in the ground with your trigger 
crossways. When he touches the apple or bait, whatever it 
is, 
his head 
is already in that noose. So when he touches that, that 
pushes the trigger down, and when it flips up, why 
it hangs him. 
It's a pole, but it's baited rather than just catchin'em. Now 
with the deadfall, then you take and 
make a figure "4" and you 
have a log or something and when he passes through and gets the 
bait, he knocks that figure 4 apart and the 
log comes down on 
him. 
GH: Have you ever - did you used to trap bear in the old days? 
MB: Oh, no. 
TB: No, there's nothing like that. They tried to 
introduce'em 
here recently... 
MB: I said I'll never go out in the yard. Even as much as I love 
to go out and pick the fresh--
GH: Do you ever have any problem catching cats or dogs 
in your 
traps? TB: I was bragging here the other year, I was bragging 
that I hadn't caught a dog in 
18 years. And then I wound up with 
three. 
They were able to release. They were runnin deer. They 
had no business being out there. One of'em was a German shepherd 
and I had caught a fox and over top of the knoll we another fox 
trap - sometimes we double set, we'll use one with the hole with 
the bait and the other'11 be just a post set. 
That's a stump or 
something with fox urine on 
it. And he was caught in this -
German shepherd! he had a studded collar on and 
MB: That's a shame.. 
TB: Why? He didn't mind it. So I walked up to him, thought "boy, 
am I gonna have fun with you" He weighed about a hundred and ten 
pounds - big. And I talked to him, he kinda wagged his tail a 
little bit - only one toe caught. So I thought "I'm gonna have 
fun with you, getting you out of there". 1 didn't have my - I 
have a choker that you can slide over their head , tighten it up 
and 
push'em away and step on the trap, see. And release'em. 
Then, 
if they're mean, you can keep'em under control and walk 
back to your vehicle and get 
in 
it, 
and release'em. 
GH: That's for dogs? 
TB: Yeah. Anyhow, I had a piece of wire, so I made just big 
enough to put over his nose and put it on my walking stick, and 
I talked to him, put it over his nose, held him away and stepped 
on the trap, released him, he started following me. And I said 
"Oh 
boy, I think you oughta go home" and I guess when I said 
home he must thought so too, cause away he went. Toward Fort 
Luddewith, that's the nearest settlement. Then later I caught a, 
just a mongrel. 
But see, there's so many wild dogs, and they 
are really mean, 
because they have no fear. They have no fear 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 19 
of man. And they will--they will come after you. 
GH: Do they have any, does the state have any program to trap 
the wild dogs? 
TB: The state will, 
if they're bad, around 
GH: Do they pay a trapper to do that? 
TB: I think that most of them, they don't even bother. Most 
of'em are killed by hunters. Say when they come on to'em. But 
when you get out in the museums and then the cabin, that's when 
you'll really something, this ain't nothing 
GH: You.ve got a museum back here? 
TB: I have two. 
MB: Yeah, you have to get going, to see all 
this stuff. 
TB: He got plenty of time. 
MB: Well, he's collecting only dust up there. 
GH: What are you going to be — see I'm a teacher out in Seattle 
and I gotta go back pretty soon, this 
is just a brief trip now. 
But I'm gonna come back just before Christmas for a week. Will 
you be doing any trapping then? 
TB: Oh, yeah. 
GH: Middle of December? 
TB: 
Yeah, 
we 
start 
the 
fifteenth 
of 
— we 
won't 
be 
trapping muskrats then, cause the muskrat season'II be 
in, 
but 
we can't go on the state until 
the first of January. See, they 
let the state — they keep the trappers off the state to give the 
duck hunters time. 
And the others, so there won't be no dogs 
caught, see. 
We'll be around here trapping, yeah, fox, raccoon 
— then you'll see some furs hanging 
in the building, with any 
kind of 
luck at all. 
MB: Let s hope we don't have a freeze—up. 
GH: That stops everything? 
TB: Not necessary. I have bags and dry sand out there. And I 
take and use the dry sand for the set. Then it's all 
right till 
we get rain,then — but then we use calcium chloride. Around our 
sets, 
you know, to keep'em from freezing up. Now it's like I 
said, the trapping fever, I wanta catch it, that's it... You 
know we use, we have a lure we use, and some of 
it's loaded with 
skunk essence. 
And that's one reason I think they say that the 
old trapper never dies, he just smells that way. 
GH: So, how do you use this lure? 
TB: This lure, I tell you, with our traps — when we set these 
traps we wear rubber gloves. When I get the trap set, before I 
handle the 
lure — I wear a pouch that's hanging out in the shed 
— I reach 
in the pouch, I take my rubber gloves and put'em to 
one side, on my trap basket, and I take and put on a pair of 
cloth gloves and I use that to put the scent and bait and lure, 
see. So that... I'll put these 
in here so momma won t step 
on'em. I'll tell you the reason I have these in here was to take 
to the 
MB: Schools 
TB: The school and the hearing over there. I took'em over to the 
hearing 
MB: He's all wound up, 
isn.t he? I said to my daughter, you 
oughta see your dad, he 
looks like an old pioneer today. She 
turned around and said "Mother, what do you expect? He's what he 
is."I'm no pioneer —I'm pioneer in my cooking. But in my dress, 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 20 
something like that, no way. I mean,I'm out 
in the world, I go 
around. I don't have nothing against it, but I do think you have 
to keep up 
TB: I have a permit for 22 — I carry a 22 rifle. But I tell you, 
the — actually, the most humane way 
is 
to stun the animal and 
then stop the heartbeat. Which 
is — you can do it with your knee 
or with your foot. A lot of the antis don't like to hear this 
but I have shot animals between the eyes and then they kick and 
struggle and 
it seems maybe they don't feel anything, one shot, 
but still 
I don't like 
to see the struggle. 
I just take 
my 
walking stick and crack a fox over the head (unintelligible) and 
then put one foot to hold his head down and the other foot back 
of the rib cage and that.s it. They never come to. Actually if 
you wanted to you could reach up there with your thumb and 
finger and shut that heartbeat off. 
I think — now with the 
muskrats — just a second. Well, I'll show you out there with a 
couple of traps. Most of your killer traps 
is 
illegal. 
JC: Cause of the strength of the spring? 
TB: Yeah, they're regular square killer. Most of'em are 
outlawed. 
(unintelligible)  
 
MB:(overlapping) 
TB: Oh, I looked like a pioneer. I had to look like a pioneer — 
I had to carry my water, from over there in buckets, when I 
first came here. I can imagine— my aunt that raised me down, 
she'd say "Muriel, you've got to come back with me, I can't 
stand you living this way." You know what their view is, 
of the 
Pineland (unintelligible) I had everything I wanted, cause my 
mother had fourteen children, and she let me go up with my aunt. 
Course I was never spoiled, never spoiled. 
GH: So your mother's family lived around here? 
MB: My mother, yeah. I was born in Milville. 
GH: How'd you meet Tom? 
MB: Tom — through his sister. I went to (unintell) 
in a shirt 
factory. His sister was there, and I was the (unintell) and she 
got me 
in with Tom. 
GH: Was he trapping then? 
MB 
Oh, was I afraid out here. Oh, 
I'd pull 
all 
the shades down, 
I'd set in the chair, I'd cry 
GH: This was after you got married? The first year? 
MB: Oh yeah. I was only married a couple months. I was married 
in March and this was in June. 
It was so hot. They'd come over 
and 
they'd say "What are you doing, woman, with these windows 
down? So hot, you know, put'em up." And I'd be afraid, oh I was 
scared to death out here. 
GH: What were you scared of? 
MB: I don't know, I was just scared. 
GH: The wilderness, huh? 
MB: The wilderness. But now, I'd be afraid to go up there and 
live. That's the jungle. Isn't it funny how life changes. 
TB: You know we — when we were coming in from California, I 
wanted 
to swing north and go up to Loon Lake. But we had our 
daughter, 
our daughter had flew 
out and 
met us 
in California, 
at her brother's, and she wanted to get home. But going out we 
took our time, we were weeks getting out there and by the time 
we got there we'd covered 58 hundred miles. Coming home, why 
it 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 21 
was 32 hundred from where our son 
lives. But we wanted to swing 
up — we were already all 
the way up 
in northern Nevada. We 
wanted to swing right on up, we wanted to go on up 
into Oregon, 
you know. 
GH: Northern Nevada is pretty bleak compared to Washington. 
Northeastern Washington, you get up 
in the mountains and it's 
real pretty country. 
TB: My boy used to make a run from San Fran all 
the way up 
into 
Vancouver, see. He was right up 
in your area there. I tell 
you, 
it's been an 
interesting life 
MB: 
It hasn't been a dull 
life. 
TB: 
It hasn't, no. 
MB: We have a lot of company. We always have a lot of company. I 
have friends come from ( ), 
have kept in touch with me for fifty 
years. And my girlfriend of 58 years, she comes down. 
GH: Not afraid to come out here to the wilderness? 
MB: No, she loves 
it out here now — but when we were first 
married she didn't like 
it. 
Well, 
I guess not. 
Old ( ) 
frontier, we didn't have anything. 
TB: We didn't have electric till 
38. When our little girl was 
born. That one I told you about — in that poem "heartbreak and 
tears". We 
lost our little girl, three years old. That was our 
baby. And she used to stand on the stool here — I was hauling 
logs, I was cuttin logs. Practically all 
my 
life, most of my 
life, I've worked 
— on construction, I've worked 
in the glass 
house, worked in a sand plant, but I always found — you'll see, 
when you get out in the cabin there, see the license tacked on 
there. I always took time because I'd leave here at 3:30 in 
the 
morning and I'd run a trap line, 
I'd be back 
in and in to work 
at 8 o'clock. 
In the glass house. After I had worked for a 
number of years for myself, and we had a good living, out of the 
woods and the farm, you know, and cutting logs. What I wrote was 
th i 
s 
— 
MB: Nothing to grow rich by 
TB: 
"Of education I have little or none. I never thought I 
needed one. For my wife and I work side by side, steady as the 
endless tide. Sharing our soil 
and work and mirth, and living 
off the good old earth.In Summer I farmed and worked 
in 
the 
woods. In 
Winter I hunted and trapped — 
we lived real 
good. 
To me the world 
was more than kind, for I had happiness and 
peace of mind. Then 
folks began to speak to me, 
of building up 
security. Security and 
dollars and cents, so off to the factory 
to work I went. The 
years have came, the years have passed, the 
so—called security 
was mine at last. But to me 
it was a waste 
of time, 
in doing so I lost my happiness and peace of mind. So 
folks, take it from me. 
If 
you have 
happiness 
and 
peace 
of 
mind, 
it's 
more 
than 
security." 
MB: He made that one up too. He's something else. All I can do 
is 
cook and take care of the house. 
GH: Ought to put it to music. 
MB: Oh, 
if anyone would want 'em, 
I'd be for it. Money's nothing 
to him, and yet we could really use — you know, you can always 
use 
some money. I don't care who you are. 
GH: You didn't work for, say for a wage, until.. 
TB: Well, off and on I had. I worked in the sand plant. The one 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 22 
thing about it, 
if I quit and came home,. she never — she said 
"Oh! you'll find something else" But she's been 
in the woods, 
she's been 
in the woods when I unloaded or loaded logs, carried 
it on my head and loaded 
it up three times cause the bottom went 
out. 
I'd get stuck, have to unload a cord of 
logs, 
load'em back 
up, carry'em, put'em on the truck, and then take off again. She 
used to go out with me after we lost our little girl. After we 
lost her, for two weeks I didn't walk. I had been on my feet for 
pretty near three weeks, at nights, and she 
looked after her in 
the daytime. They said viral pneumonia, but I don't think so, I 
think 
it was meningitis. She had a fever when she died, a 
hundred and six, 
and 
her 
head 
was drawed right back between 
her shoulders. And she had got threwed from a back seat of a 
car, we were riding with friends and some darn fool made a turn 
in front of us and hit the brake and she went down and hit the 
back of her head. That was about two weeks before she was 
stricken — it might not a had something to do with 
it, 
but — she 
was a real doll. Everything she did, she'd say "I didn't do 
it, 
the boy did it."She said her brother was the boy, she said 
"Daddy's Tom, that's the boy." And that's the way 
it happened. 
MB: (overlapping)we wanted to put her 
in the hospital but he 
said no, 
I'll 
come every day. He said, we've got new medicine 
coming out, but he didn't know how to use it. Hadn't came out 
too 
long, 
had 
it? Sulfa. 
TB: Penicillin. 
GH: What year was this? 
TB: 
43. No, 
46, she died, 
43, she was born. 
GH: We tend to forget how recent a lot of these medicines were. 
MB: She would have lived 
if 
they could have gave her that. 
TB: 
In 46, 
our doctor hadn't used it. 
Today, 
I don't think 
there'd have been any problem. At that time doctor--
MB: Mayhew 
TB: No, the other doctor, the one you went to — Colby. Dr. Colby 
he used 
it on a boy to break the fever and the boy 
is more or 
less retarded. The high fever 
MB: Now the doctor said to me, he said "Muriel, I could go on 
and 
break this fever, but your baby would never be right." 
TB: He said "I can break 
it but it'll break her." 
MB: 
...a bushel basket head and he said that would be terrible 
on you folks. So see her brain had gone already. 
TB: She was brain dead already, from the high fever. 
MB: He said I couldn t go on and live with that cause it'd be 
awful hardship on you folks. 
TB: He said he hadn't lost one 
in twelve or fifteen years, he 
said, and he said "Tom, 
I gotta loose yours." Now I'll 
tell 
you 
how bad things was at that time — a visit from Milville here was 
three dollars. 
MB: He came every day, every day. 
TB: 
And lotta 
times, 
after 
the 
doctor left, you'd 
lift the 
tablecloth and your three dollars was under the tablecloth. 
MB: Yeah, he wouldn't take it. 
TB: He'd put he money back. 
GH: What's that — oh, a squirrel. 
TB: There he 
is, on the side of the tree 
MB: You enjoy what you see out there. 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 23 
JC: That's a beautiful tree - it's a willow, 
isn't it? 
TB: 
Yeah, 
it's been hit by 
lightning. I been taking the dead 
limbs off. I planted that in 
1938. 
When we built, had the one 
room on here 
- hey he thinks I picked the walnuts just for him 
- This is what I just built for 
- where you at? Where'd you go? 
- This is gonna be for our meetings of the trappers association. 
This here, I just put this room on. I built this here, the 
walls I built forty-some years ago, with a fireplace, but this 
has been like this and I was gonna buy a new power mower 
and instead of buying a power mower - it was so dry I didn't 
need 
it - so I went and built this on here. And this 
is one of 
my museums. This here, 
let's get a light on here so you can 
see ... 
JC: Oh my god. 
GH: You could go through a few rolls of film in here. So you 
take the school kids around through here when they come to 
visit. 
TB Oh yeah, they come in and I take'em on field trips and when I 
took 'em on a field trip the one little colored girl, she'd been 
walking hand 
in hand with me, on the blackboard back here she 
wrote "Tom Brown, I love you, Letitia" 
JC: You found all 
this stuff yourself? 
TB: 
Yeah, 
they 
come 
from 
Thompson's 
Beach. 
These 
here 
are Arkansas arrowhead - this 
is not an arrowhead, this 
is a 
drill. 
I'd like for you just to see this - feel the 
fingerprints prints 
in 
there. 
See, move it right in. Put that 
in your hand, put your hand like that. See, 
it fits right in 
those fingers. 
JC: A pounder 
TB: Uhhuh. That come from right up here at Union Lake. Feel the 
prints, no matter which way you - see how your thumb fits right 
in there? Right on around. You can see how that's wore down. Lot 
of people see this, they wouldn't know what it was. 
GH: Looks like a rock. 
TB: Mmhmm 
GH: So your mother's father was Indian? 
TB: 
Indian. 
GH: Was he one of the local Delawre Indians 
TB: Yeah, he was a local - L- n, L-n-p' 
as near as I can 
pronounce - This is one of my favorites ..here - the end of the 
journey. Here's, 
in here, that's a First World War uniform. I 
knew the man who wore that in the First World War, Percy Smith. 
Here's something you don't often see - there's the Lord's Prayer 
in postal cards, see it? There's so much here, 
it would be hard 
to see. When the children, when the schoolkids come in here I 
say "you all 
know who that is - that.s Sitting Bull.I'm his 
great-great-great-grandson Fullubull." Get the kids a laughing. 
The first thing I tell'em when I go 
in there is "Look, I'm Tom 
Brown. 
No Mister Brown, because if 
you say mister I'm gonna 
look and see 
if there's somebody standing behind me." 
There's 
something too, up there - see that brace? 
That'll drill around 
corners, 
got a universal 
in 
it. Here s the old wagon jack for 
jacking up - I had the old planes, the old broad axes, the 
ice 
axes here, the old 
wagon tools. This 
is only one building. Here 
is 
the, that's the one that plays the, wind with a key, plays 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs

the roll — that's a little gem. ( )gem. 
GH: Did you buy this an an antique? 
TB: No, I been collecting and — now here 
is the medicine here 
and 
this 
is 
all the original, I think this has got 68% alcohol. 
This 
is the original medicine. They didn't feel no pain — they 
was drunk. Here's something I'd like for you to read on this 
one. 
See, you 
know this would freeze and break because sometimes it's 4 below 
zero out here. But read that. 
JC:

GH: 
"1906" 
JC: 
187. alcohol — pyrodol. 
TB: Yup — all 
this has, I have one vial, I don't know what — I 
wanta get rid of this stuff 
JC: Maybe you can tell me, I got hold of some old bottles the 
other day and some of them 
have got like a mother—of—pearl 
coating on the inside. Do you know what that;s from? 
TB: I think it's what you call — oxidation is 
it? Or sun may 
have done 
it. But over here there's all 
kinds. Over there 
there's sea weed tonic. There's one bottle here that I would 
like to show you. Now this is old — see that's hand blown, you 
can see 
it. 
Read on that. 
JC: An old English whiskey bottle, huh? 
TB: mmhmm. 
GH: You think its before the Revolutionary War? 
TB: I imagine it's quite a ways.. 
GH: Or imported after? 
TB: Well. 
JC: What are these old bottles down here? 
TB: They are whiskey bottles. Whiskey flasks, they call them. 
JC: Do you know what period they.re from more or less? 
TB: There's no name on them — I think what happened was when 
they made them years ago, practically everybody, you know, used 
the same type of bottle, but they took and put their stamp on 
it. 
See, they made the one type bottle, but — would you like to 
have one for your collection? 
JC: As a matter of fact, I just got one yesterday. 
TB: Did you get one of the flasks. 
JC: Yeah, sort of a flask like this, and I was wondering what 
period it was from. 
TB: Now, these are all 
hand—blown — you gotta have a souvenir — 
JC: When were these made, about? 
TB: I would say these were made before the bottle machines come 
out, so I would say roughly 
in 
the early part of this, you know, 
maybe nineteen eight, somewhere around in there. But this here — 
I have 400 of these. 
JC: How about this type of bottle, this medicine bottle? 
TB: They, they're old. Yeah, they, 
lotta those are real 
old. 
JC: How far back would you say these go? 
TB: Some of those would go back before the turn (TB plays music) 
JC: Like the 1880s? (music still playing) 
TB: I got "When Lindberg flew over" (music) 
GH: When did you buy the machine? 
TB: That was a gift from one of my — see, I used to be a guide, 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 25 
I used to take gangs out hunting. And one of the fellows that 
hunted with me, he picked this here Victrola up somewhere and 
give 
it to me. He brought it here in an old — not an old, but an 
English Ford, and 
if 
he didn't have a job getting out of the 
back after he d got it 
in there. Jack Davis gave me that. 
GH: The old records,those are your records? 
TB: Yeah, my mother's. My brother brought'em, when he sold the 
farm, he brought'em down and he gave'em to me. He brought'em 
down 
in a suitcase. I have "When Lindberg flew over" "Lucky 
Lindy" 
it's called. I got "The Death of Florrie Collins" — I 
have all 
those. 
Running down a little bit. 
GH: You ve got to crank it up, huh? 
TB: Yeah. (music livens up) 
GH: Hard to find needles these days? 
TB: No, you can send 
in Philly and get'em. Over here, see the 
two frames up on the side? That's my uncle's war record 
in 
the 
Civil War. Right up here.I'm gonna see 
if that's shut off.

TXOI:TB: Why that says he died of cruel treatment and starvation 
at the hands of the rebels. And then it tells there where my 
grandmother got eight dollars a month pension. For the loss of 
her son. These here - one of'em was made 
in 1918 - they're hand 
blown. And the other one was made 
in 1325. Course this here 
is a 
crossbow here. Shoot the bolts here. 
JC: Ever shoot that one? 
TB: Yes I have. It's illegal. 
JC: 
Is 
it 
illegal 
in New Jersey? 
TB: Yeah. There's the old antique bulbs - I got'em hooked up 
in a 
series, see, and I put'em up there. And here 
is your old antique 
type 
shoes. 
My 
father 
was 
a shoemaker 
- I don't 
mean shoe 
cobbler. He could make you a pair of boots or shoes. But these 
are the old lace shoes and the button shoes and this 
is the -
this trap here 
is the kind I don't use anymore. 
This 
is the 
regular steel trap. This 
is the kind I was telling you about, they 
can twist off. I have a five year old boy that can take this trap 
and he'll put his hand 
in 
it all 
day long. And that's a good 
trap. See there's really 
not a thing 
GH: 
It doesn't have the holdfast 
TB: 
It don't.. 
GH: That's a number one? 
TB: That's a number one, yeah. This 
is the kind that the muskrat 
- without the guard on 
it, they can get away. You know I'm more 
afraid of a mouse trap than I am this. You see this here, there's 
nothing to 
it. Now that other one went too, but this here - a 
mouse trap will hurt much more than what this would. 
GH: Where do you get your traps? Where do they make'em? 
TB: This are made by Woodstream Corporation, 
in Pennsylvania. 
GH: They been making traps for a long time 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 27 
TB: Yeah, they mostly — Woodstream I guess has bought pretty 
near everybody out. There's a "Wanted — Pony Express". Mostly 
they wanted orphans. 
GH: 
Is that a real honest—to—goodness Pony Express flier or 
is 
that a reproduction? 
TB: I think that could be a reproduction. You take — up there 
you'll see banknotes —see'em up there? Albany, New York, I think 
that goes back to 1836. Over here, these books go back to 1852. 1 
have one book 
in the house, 
in the front room there, that has got 
our state papers, and this nation was really young at that time — 
1813. 
GH: You say your 
baskets? 
TB: Yup. They made 
wove 'em, together 
GH: Do you have an 
TB: No. 
GH: So the white oak 
is a special kind of oak around here? 
TB: White oak 
is what they use for ax handles and stuff like 
that, yeah. This here I think — there's a young woman that's a 
antique dealer, and she said this here, she said "I don't have 
money to buy your stuff here," she said "that's valued about 1200 
bucks. And this here from five to seven hundred. 
GH: Yeah, I was wondering if you've ever had your stuff appraised 
TB: Umhm. This I know that something like this, of Buffalo Bill — 
there's one like this in a museum in Reddinton, Florida. 
GH: Do you know who made it? 
TB: No, I don't. No idea. But I have all kinds 
In here — 
this 
is a diary of a major in the Union Army. But this 
is 
and this was Holmes (Hann?) and here was his — in the War 
States, this was his paper weight. See, 
it's 
got the 258 
piece of shell and a piece of rebel bayonet. Holmes Hann, 
great grandson is 
retired from the army, and he was a major. John 
Mayhew, at Newport. But in here, you can't believe the writing in 
this book — look how it 
looks like it'd just been written today. 
GH: Looks like a lead pencil. 
TB: Umhm. And 
it tells how much grain he ground, how many bushel 
of grain, how many board feet of 
logs he sawed, and this is all 
water power, see. The sawmill and the grist mill was right there. 
GH: Where did he live? 
TB: Newport. 
GH: 
In New Jersey? 
TB: Yeah. I have the papers 
in the house. I also have a letter 
from my uncle, that he wrote home from the Civil War. 
GH: 
Is there a local history museum? Or a state museum... 
TB: Yeah — here's the papers, on the Civil War. See, here, Down 
Township, that's down where I been going 
in the schools, they paid 
a man money to go fight for the township. 
GH" "Bounty to volunteers" This is for the "Civil War of 1863" 
TB: Now, you know — you say you re a teacher? — well, 
if you 
didn't want to fight, you know this, 
if you didn't wanta fight 
and you had money you'd hire somebody to fight. Well now if 
you 
couldn't find anybody that would fight for you, you could go up 
to Philadelphia and they'd find somebody to fight for you.

GH: That's your granddaughter? 
TB: Granddaughter, 
mmhm. She's 
in — we 
went down to 
her 
graduation when she graduated from boot camp, and I got the shock 
of my 
life because when she came out she was 
in charge of her 
company. Yes, she'd already, she had made commanding, and she put'em 
through the drills and then she went up before the Admiral and 
saluted and "Sir, I turn Company 32 something or other over to you" 
and later he asked her, he said "Where did a little girl 
like you get 
such a volume of voice. And then she told him that she had sang 
in a 
group, you know. She was.. 
GH: So your granddaughter's in the Navy? 
GH: She was. She's out now. Her husband's still 
in the Navy, but 
she lives 
in South Carolina — Charleston. 
GH: You want to take us around the rest of the yard? 
TB: Yeah, we'll take you around. I'll pull this flag off, we'll go 
out that door. There. When the grandson comes home he's gonna 
wire this other one up. We can go right out this way. On the 
porch there's the old grindstones and all the different kinds of 
stuff. See my onions up overhead? 
I'll 
get 'em down now and I'll 
put 'em 
in 
GH: That's from your own garden? 
TB: Yeah. See, when I hang 'em up that way, see, now and then one 
rotted but I'll 
pull that one out and I'll hang 'em up down 
in 
the 
basement, and there's a basement underneath the other side here. 
GH: How long's 
it take to cure them up here before you can put 
them in the basement? 
TB: They'd be all 
right when I dug 
'em, pulled 'em rather. This 
is 
from the sponge bark of that tree down there in Florida. Feel 
them, 
it feels just like... 
GH: Amazing. Sponge—bark tree, eh?

corn sheiler on there. I had 
it mounted here but the nephew 
wanted to borrow it and use 
it, so.. I think I'll take you to the 
cabin. 
GH: 
Is this a particular kind of grass, do you know? I've seen 
this around. 
TB: Yeah, that's what they call Indian grass -it's a nuisance. 
These are flowers come all up here. See I kept the old farm till 
- this here, 
look how 
- this was the cactus family, yucca - look 
how high 
it was, then it has the bells, 
like, hanging on 
it 
GH: Does that yucca grow around here wild? or 
is 
it something you 
plant? 
TB: No, 
it'll 
grow wild. This 
is a hardy plant. All along here 
is 
the old farm tools setting around 
GH: Are these the tools that you used? 
TB: This is the tools that we used to use. With the mule teams. 
This plow here and that one there, my brother followed that with 
the mule team and I'd maybe five years old, I was 
in the furrow 
behind him, walking around. You know, years ago - I'm talking about 
1916 - you very seldom ever seen a deer. And now there's deer in 
practically every 
county 
in the state of New Jersey, 21 counties. 
So you can see - they brought 'em 
in 
in 1911 I think - how they 
multiplied. They are all 
over the place. 
GH: So there weren't any deer before 1911? 
TB: Now and then - but not that many, no. This here, we'll just 
take a glance in here, this 
is another one - this 
is my tool 
house. This here is cluttered. I had to store stuff in here. My 
lathe I stand here, I take pieces like this, and I cut potato 
mashers, rollin pins out and I give 'em to the school teachers, 
the classrooms I go 
into. 
It's cluttered but you know there's all 
kinds of stuff 
in here. Here - I don't touch these, I put 'em in 
here. Here.s the traps, ready for to set for fox. I got 'em 
in 
cedar bow. 
GH: Why 
is 
it 
in cedar? 
TB: Well, that there will - the scent from the cedar will kill 
any odor of handling--
GH: 
Is that the Jersey or white cedar? 
TB: 
Yeah 
that's the - no, 
that's 
red 
cedar, 
upland 
cedar. 
There's all kinds of things 
in here. There's all 
the old ice 
skates here 
GH: How about these decoys here? 
TB: There not. Did you see the ones on the floor in the middle 
room there? I was offered two and a quarter for one and a hundred 
- I think a hundred and a quarter for one and two hundred for the 
other one. 
In there on the floor. These are just paper stuff 
back here. This is a lapdesk. This is the kind of desk they had 
in the Civil War. They'd hold it on their knees. And I've got 
different things in there. The old tools - I love old tools. 
These - the cant(?) hooks and pv's as they call 
'em I used them 
when I was logging. I used to 
load logs and they wondered how I 
got 'em on, but I used a rope with a dutchman, start the log up 
the skids and then as I went up it would hook, I would tighten up 
on the rope. And that held it. 
GH: What s a dutchman? 
TB: 
A dutchman 
is what you put in a rope that works like a 
tackle. A loop, and then when you put the other rope through it, 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 30 
you re pulling and then you tighten it up as you go. Acts just 
like a block and fail. 
GH: When you did this lumbering, you'd sell the timber to the 
mill? 
TB: To the mill. Yeah, I hauled 'em 
in there. 
GH: Was that pine? 
TB: That was pine, all 
pine. 
GH: I haven't seen too much pine right around here - is there 
places where it grows? 
TB: 
I'll 
tell you, we cut the pine all 
off. And then the pine 
don't come back - the oak comes back. This was a pine here - and 
there's one log out there yet, one tree I left. You can get the 
idea. Over here 
in this cabinet here - see the grouse up there? 
That grouse was mounted 58 years ago. 
GH: Do you still get grouse around? 
TB: Oh, 
lot of grouse. There's a grouse - all these was mounted 
about 58 years ago. 
GH: By yourself? 
TB: No. Hermann Coates, Veiman. At that time they used arsenic, 
which 
is deadly poison. It got 
in his bloodstream, through his 
fingernails - under his fingernail and 
it killed him. That's what 
a kit looks like - see how small 
it 
is up there? This horse was 
given to me by my teacher in the seventh grade and I was talking 
to her the other day. She has a poem in there, where she wrote 
i 
t. 
GH: She must be getting along 
TB: She 
is 
in her eighties. 
GH: But still 
lives around. 
TB: Mmhm, 
lives 
in Milville. 
GH: So that's a squirrel, opossum? 
TB: Mmhm 
GH: That's a grouse. 
TB: Yeah. I have a book on the Civil War in there. 
JC: So have you always been a collector? 
TB: More or less. You can see the harness and the saw and the 
whole works. Now we'll 
go back and I show you the real McCoy. 
GH: Those are your rubber gloves, that you use? And these metal 
stakes are for staking them down. 
TB: Yeah, they're bolts and stakes. 
GH: The metal stakes here with his traps 
in the basket 
with red cedar to kill the scent - what are these about half, 
quarter inch bolts? -
TB: Yeah, wrought iron. 
GH: Then do you weld that on yourself? 
TB: No, they are the ones that I bought off another fellow. 
GH: A little triangular wedge goes into the ground to 
hold 
it. 
TB: Yeah 
GH: The stakes are about 18 
inches long? 
TB: Some are longer. Did you see here how I got that rigged? 
GH: And the swivel that he made himself, 
in the chain. 
(JC takes pictures) 
TB: See how that works? Don't give it chance to tangle up. 
GH: How many traps do you have altogether, that you use? 
TB: Hundred. 
Hunn-- 83 Audiocassette logs 
page 31 
GH: A hundred? 
TB: Hundreds. I have maybe a hundred and thirty of the muskrat 
traps. 
Have more'n that, I have a hundred and, maybe a hundred 
and seventy five muskrat traps, of both types. And then the fox 
traps - I don't use that many, I have about seventy-five. But you 
only put out 
maybe thirty-five, forty - what you can tend to. 
GH: 
Is that about the most you can tend to for fox, 35 or 40? 
TB: Oh no - lot of 
'em will put you a hundred trap, but I don't 
cover the area that I would otherwise. 
GH: You usually set the traps and then leave 'em 
in the same place 
for how long - all 
season? 
TB: I do - I leave 
'em for a week or so. See, a lot of the problem 
with these boys that are trapping is, 
like I tell 
'em, they don't 
catch fox because there ain't no fox there. That's the story -
it's impossible to catch an animal 
if 
he s not there. 
GH: How do you tell whether there are foxes in the neighborhood? 
TB: Tracks. Droppings. That's the thing--
GH: And the kids these days just don't know how to 
identify the 
signs? 
TB: No, they have to be trained, they have to be taught. You 
know, 
There's a lot of 
'em 
that we teach, 
will never make a 
trapper. Then there's others that you teach, will beat me. They 
are born to 
it, 
you know. I had one young man, Jack Snyder - his 
little boy that puts his hand 
in the trap all 
the time, five 
years old - but I taught Jack last year, right here. And he had 
never caught, he's had never caught fox - he wound up with 21. Talk 
about - he don't think I can make a mistake, and I tell him I 
make plenty of 
'em. He 
is a born trapper and he.s a wonderful 
hunter too. 
GH: He lives here 
in Milville? 
TB: No, he 
lives in Petersburg. 
GH: Does he do trapping full time? 
TB: No, he works there for Lennox Electric, but he's - well, he's a 
carpenter, he s only 28 years old. Got a daughter 11, daughter 9 
and a boy 5 - they were both married when they were 16. And you 
will never find a more marvelous couple than that two. They have 
their greenhouses, they have acres of shrubbery, and they work. 
It's another case of togetherness. I'll 
tell you, 
last winter I 
was under the weather a little bit, and this boy comes 
in the 
yard and drops me off two load of wood at the cellar window. Now, 
that just goes to show you what friends are. You can have all the 
money 
in the world, 
if you don't have friends, you ain't nothing. 
No way. 
GH: So if a kid wanted to 
learn how to trap, he'd go to your 
trapping organization, and you have classes or? 
TB: 
They 
don't 
have 
to necessarily join 
the 
organization - when they take their test. We have people to teach 
'em, 
and then 
if they want to they can join. But I have told 
em, 
anyone, 
if they want to come here, give me a call and I'll 
take 
'em out and teach 'em. That's more than most of 
em will do - they 
only show 'em the basics, you know, of how to trap. But if 
they 
come here I'll 
show 'em all 
kinds of different sets to help 'em 
out. 
GH: Do you think there's room here 
in the area for a lot more 
trappers? 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 32 
TB: Well, I figure there's room enough. There's plenty of 
territory - there's six mile of woods beyond the house here 
before you come into a town. Course, you're running into a lot of 
private property any more, that they have posted, see, which 
makes a difference. 
With the state and all 
I think we have 
plenty. 
GH: 
Do 
you 
trap 
on peoples. private 
property 
with their 
permission? 
TB: 
Oh yeah. Definitely. So when you get in the other place,, 
that's when you'll really see the traps - course a lot of traps 
is here and then up here 
in the yard is more of 
'em too. 
GH: So these are just a few of your traps in here? 
TB: They're fox traps. And when you get back 
in the other place 
you'll see the muskrat traps and a few fox traps. Then up here 
I'll 
show you where I wax 'em and dye 'em. 
GH: You wax and dye your traps? 
TB: Oh yeah. These are all waxed and dyed. 
GH: Do you have to do that every year? 
TB: See, 
if you notice these, they got a film of wax on 
'em. see. 
GH: Do you dip them in the wax? 
TB: First you dip 
'em in the dye, you (unintell) 'em 
in the dye. 
Then 
you take and wax 
'em and you notice - see the nail 
in between 
the jaws? That's so that they'll get dyed and waxed. 
GH: That's so they'll blend 
in and you can't see 'em? 
TB: No. They're covered. That's to keep the odor down. So from 
now on I'll handle 'em with gloves. 
GH: The wax and the dye. 
TB: Mmhm. The wax - the dye colors 'em and the wax keeps 'em from 
rusting - keeps the odor. because, with that trap buried in the 
ground, and they start to rust, the animal can scent it, 
That's the story there. 
GH: So, the black dye - what kind of dye 
is that. 
TB: Well, you don't even have to buy dye. 
GH: What do you use? 
TB: Walnut hulls. Yeah, the walnut hulls will 
do a good... 
GH: So, you brew 'em up, cook 'em up 
in a pot? 
TB: Yeah. Get the walnuts and dump 'em 
in - I got a boiler,it's 
the greatest thing I've ever used to do this. I took the walnuts 
and just dumped 'em 
in, 
but I did add trap dye - it"s a powdered 
trap dye that you buy, and I bought it while I was 
in New York 
state. The dye - the fellow was from Chelsea Idaho - Iowa - and 
he had it'so cheap for sale that I bought some and I just dumped 
a couple of them in with the walnut hull and as you can see 
it 
did a marvelous job. 
GH: 
Yeah, 
they're real nice. So the walnut hulls - you grow 
walnuts in your yard or you just buy 'em? 
TB: Yeah - it wouldn't pay you to buy 
'em, 
it'd be so expensive. 
But around in the woods there's so many old abandoned farms you 
can go up and pick 'em up by the bushel. 
GH: So these are black walnuts? 
TB: Black walnuts, mmhm. The trees, the black walnut trees is 
becoming scarce because people go right in and they'll cut that 
tree down and they'll even take the stump. 
GH: What do they use 
it for? 
TB: Lot of times they use 
it for gun stocks - and lumber.

kill 
an animal. Now he could shoot an animal, as 
long as the 
animal had a chance. 
I had a friend that was killed 
in 
the 
service - he was the same way. But if a duck got up, 
it had to 
get so far away before he would take and shoot. The same way 
if 
he pulled a pike or pickerel out of the water - he never measured 
it, 
he took one look and 
if 
it wasn't up to his standards he 
released it right away. And he was 
in the service, he was 
in 
Louisiana, and somebody tripped the bomb bay doors and dropped 
the auxilliary gas tank on him and 
it crushed him. He was killed 
in 
1950. 24 years old. But he was a real sportsman. I mean you 
couldn't believe it. Well, we might as well go back to the other 
building. 
GH: So the muskrats, they're usually drowned by the time you pick 
em up 
TB: No, the muskrat - I'll show you the killer trap. They are 
killed. If we set the steel traps they drown. But if we set the 
other, they are instantly practically killed. This 
is the four-
wheel drive. 
I'll 
use this -it's only got 23,000 on 
it - I 
bought it new, you see on the side the coon and the fox. 
GH: You mentioned possum - you trap possum too? 
TB: See this 
is one thing that the antis say, 
like the actress -
Loretta Swit I think her name? - for the Mother Earth Magazine. 
She said 
it took a hundred twenty six fox to make a coat. I asked 
the dealer, I said "How many?" He said 12 to 15. She said, and 
catching that many fox, you throw 146 trash animals away. Well I 
was subscribing to the Mother Earth magazine and I wrote and I 
asked, I said " How can can you let an 
irresponsible person write 
an article like that?" I said, "She does not understand" and I 
said "If you will, please write and tell me what a trash animal 
is, 
because in 60 years I don't know." I said "The furs is fox, 
raccoon" I named them all, right on down, I said "There's no trash 
here. The weasel, the possum, all 
have a value, so we skin 'em 
out. 
If we don't want 'em, we release 'em. That only leaves rabbit 
and squirrel, and they're game animals. They re on our list as 
game animals. So there's no trash. I d like to know what, the 
trash.." So that was 
it. They wrote and said, well we'll 
look 
into 
it, 
but I never heard no more about it. But I did drop the 
magazine. I don't take 
it. 
GH: They never presented your point of view. 
TB: No. This here 
is 1947 model. That one there is a 1943. This 
thing here... 
GH: These are the tractors you used on your farm? 
TB: Yeah. That one we only used for scraping the road. This one 
here I use for the gardening. I don't know if 
it'll go right off 
today or not. Usually she 
moves right along. Ain't gonna go 
today. 
GH: What do you have to do to get it fired up then? 
TB: She usually kicks right off, but - she may be out of gas. 
She.s not gonna start off - if she don't go. 
(motor starts) 
GH: So when did you say you bought this machine? 
TB: I bought it second hand 
in 
1966. I give 600 dollars for it. 
She runs like a charm. 
GH: When was 
it built? 
TB: 
1947. 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 35 
GH: 
It.s a McCormick Farmall International Harvester super S 
tractor. 
TB: I was surprised when she didn't go first off. Its a vacuum -
you raise your cultivators up and down. And when - with the plow 
on the back you use the lever and the plow s setting 
in here. But 
-it's supposed to be too small for the job but that's what I 
use, that double plow behind it, 
and she turns the soil 
right 
o 
v

r. 
GH: What have you got hanging from the rafters here? 
TB: That's where the onions have been. See, there's my camper. 
That slides right on the back of the Dodge in case I have to stay 
overnight. It's got two bunks 
in there and I and I have a little 
heating stove. This 
is my trapping headquarters - I got like a 
little park here. The deer go right through here, and that's the 
hunting cabin back up here. 
GH: How much land do you have? 
TB: I got ten acres. One time we had 200. But Dad gave me this 
because he said when my trapping and my turning money over when I 
worked in the sand hole, to mother, 
it took a load off of him. So 
he called me 
in one day, he said you're not the oldest of the 
five, the younger children, but I'm gonna give you your pick, he 
said 
if you want it, 
you can have your pick of a lot on the 
highway, two and a half acres, or you can have 6 acres back off 
the highway. I said Dad I'll take the six, I wouldn't want to be 
on the highway. He said I.m glad you said that boy, bein as you 
said that I'll 
give you ten. So he divided ten up amongst four 
and gave me ten back here. But that's the way Dad was. 
GH: So he had 20 to begin with. 
TB: Oh no, 
he had 200. Altogether. 75 on this side of the road. 
72 and a half. It's nice back here - you think you're miles 
from 
anywhere. This 
is the boys 
- now I don't hunt with the gang no 
more. I take the grandson and maybe another boy, or both 
grandsons, and I don't think there's ever a bigger thrill 
to a 
had than when I took 2 grandsons and I left my gun at home and I 
just brushed for them. One grandson on one side of me and one on 
the other - if the rabbit went one way one would get it, the 
other way the other one would get it. 
GH: You "brushed" for them? 
TB: Yeah. Jump 'em. 
GH: Just means you walk back through the woods and flush 'em out? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: What kind of trees you got here 
in your yard, can you tell me 
something about these? 
TB: Yeah, these here are white oak, these ones you see here. Now 
right behind it 
is a black oak - the two big ones straight 
through here, they're chestnut oak. Over here the other side of 
the white oak there's a hickory. And then I imagine around in 
there there'd be pin oaks. That dead one right through here 
is a 
white birch. These here are ponderosa pine - I planted these pine 
in here. We had a bad storm - you can see where the top 
is 
out of that one. 
GH: Do you use all 
these different kinds of oaks 
in different 
ways? 
TB: Yeah, mostly firewood. Actually, this here is about, oh 
roughly third growth, see, over the years. Dad bought this farm - 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 36 
I showed you that diary, Holmes Hann diary in there 
- in there 
is about bringing a horse from Newport and trading it to peter 
Brick. And that's the name of the man that Pop bought the farm 
off of for five dollars an acre. My nephew two years ago, he sold 
the ground to Atlantic Electric for 2850 dolars an acre. And I 
coulda bought it fourteen years ago off my brother for 90 dollars 
an acre and I didn't do 
it. 
GH: Probably be worth 10,000 an acre in a few years.. 
TB: Well, I think Atlantic City'll hold it, I don't think they 
will bother. 
(JC taking pictures) 
GH: Do you use the birch here? 
TB: No. I'll tell 
you what we use sometimes, you know you were 
talking about the dying traps - a lot of them get the maple bark, 
strip it off the tree, and they'll use that for dyeing the traps 
because that will darken 'em up (unintelligible) I think that's 
1876 that's marked on that grindstone there. 
GH: 
Is that sandstone? 
TB: That's a cut stone - I don't know what it 
is that they make 
it out of. This 
is a piece of antler. There's so much that - when 
we go back 
in the house I'll 
show you what I do with antlers. The 
antler - we had a set give to us when we got married and it was 
composition stuff, 
it crumbled right off 
So I put antler on 
instead and I had knife and so on. But we use 
'em for buttons, you 
can use 
'em for a hunting coat or something like that or you use 
em 
like this here for the door. 
GH: This is from the deer, the local deer? 
TB: Mmhm, that's a prong offa deer. See, 
it makes a good - and 
then on the back I'll show you the door handle made from the 
antlers. This 
is our group of trappers 
GH: The Southern New Jersey Fur-takers 14a. 
Is the 14 the number 
for New Jersey? 
TB: 
14 
is central New Jersy. 14a 
is southern New Jersey. We have 
the two chapters. 
We got 
another chapter and that's called 
coastal trappers association. 
GH: What s this here 
TB: That's a fur stretcher. 
That's for muskrat. 
GH: So after you kill an animal you skin 
it out, out 
in 
the 
woods? 
TB: No. Right here 
in the back. You'll see 
in here, I'll put the 
lights on. I spend a lot of time 
in here - my wife'll come back 
here and she'll - if 
you 
look overhead that's where you see the 
old license - years back, and then I have more on my - I have a 
exhibit that I set up. Here's my grandson. He's homesick. He's 
in 
Florida in a university. He's 21 years old and homesick. He told 
his mother - since he was a little tacker he's never called me 
nothing but old man - and he said tell the old man to hop a plane 
and come on down. I took him out - I saw him when he swung and 
shot at the deer and then I seen him raise up and shoot pretty 
near straight down from his stand. So then he said - he 
lowered his 
gun, come on down, come over and he 
looked up the tree at me and 
he said, come on down•old man, I got a nice small six pointer. So 
I emptied my gun, come on down., walked over and I said, boy that 
deer's not small - and 
it ain't a six, 
it's only a.five. He said 
I didn't look at the other side. 
In other words he'd only counted 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 37 
one side. Here s his antlers right here, here 
in the back room 
where I skinned it for him. 
So I had two boys out that year and 
here's the other one. By 8 o'clock they both had 5 pointers. 
GH: Do you have kind of a special party when they get their first 
d 
e 
e 
r? 
, 
TB: We have a party - we have a bad party. I'll 
tell 
you it's -bad 
for - usually, I'll 
tell 
you what they do. When they've got 'em 
hanging up they take the paunch out and they nick that paunch and 
they 
let the guy have it. That's awful - awful mess. I seen that 
happen one time and they got the wrong man - another man stepped 
in, 
instead of getting the one that killed the deer they got the 
guy behind him, and this fellow he was really shook up. All 
brand 
new hunting outfit on. 
GH: They throw the guts at them? 
TB: 
It's the paunch and 
it has all 
that green browse in 
it and 
it 
stinks to high heaven. 
GH: So they hang it over you when you get your first deer. 
TB: Yeah. They christen you all 
right. It's bad. 
GH: How much does your license cost? 
TB: I think this year 24 something. 
GH: You pay for a different license for each 
TB: Yeah. A different - at one time, my first license cost me a 
dollar sixty five. That was fishing, hunting and trapping. Now a 
trapping license - I believe it'll 
be 24, 
it was 20. But I think 
it'll 
be 24 this year. But then my hunting license I get half. 
GH: That lets you trap all the animals? 
TB: 
Except beaver and otter. They have a special permit.That's my 
grandson's first squirrel. I tanned it for him. And this is his 
first deer, this is his deer hide I fixed for him on the floor 
here. Maybe you'd like one of these here.-
GH: Do you have an extra one? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: 
It explains the rules and regulations of trapping? 
TB: 
No, 
that's 
just 
about 
the 
wildlife. 
Here 
is 
great 
grandchildren - see him holding the furs here, the rats. I won't 
let 'em touch a fox or coon anymore because I'm afraid of rabies 
I keep 'em away from those. 
GH: Have there been any problems with rabies? 
TB: Here s last weekend in Philipsburg, New Jersey - young woman 
23 years old - and the antis'II tell you 
no cases of rabies but you 
better believe it we do have. These are weasels - there wasn't no 
value on 
'em so I just tanned 'em. Put 'em up there. This 
is 
1982 out 
in front of the cabin - you might think 
it was north. See the foxes 
hangin up? 
GH: Doesit'snow like that every winter? 
TB: Not every winter, no. Once 
in a while we do. Now there's a 
fox with a trap on each foot. Now you can see he's not suffering 
- he s held there, that's all. That was November 1979 
GH: Can you tell from the signs whether you've got a red fox or a 
grey one? 
TB: Yes, definitely. By the footprints. The grey fox 
is 
like a 
cat - small.. And one foot ahead of the other. The red fox 
is the 
size of a small rabbit hound - it's 
a much bigger track. Oh yeah 
definitely you can tell what's 
who just by the tracks. 
GH: How do the two kinds of fox compare 
in their body size? Are 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 38 
they the same size? 
TB: No, most the time a red will 
be 
larger. But a fox 
is not a 
large animal. If you take a full grown fox, you got a large fox, 
weighs 10, 
11 
pound. Here s a sample fox hide. Now I'm holding 
about 700 dollars there. 
GH: Now these are reds. 
TB: 
They're reds 
and 
they're greys. These are all 
antiques. 
Here s one of the baskets more like what we were talking about, 
see, 
GH: White oak baskets? 
TB: Mmhm, that's the type 
Now you take these traps here with the 
teeth, they been outlawed for years. Here is my 
life memberships 
right here. This is 
GH: Did they ever use that kind of thing any more, even for bear? 
TB: No. 
Well, they might some places for bear, but I think 
they've went away from the teeth too. I have a friend, an artist, 
and she does the snapper she'll and the canoe paddle. Here, these 
are old fur stretchers, with the wood ducks and the deer on 
'em. 
GH: What do you make your fur stretchers out of? 
TB: I don't any more. I use all wire frames. There's the wood 
stretchers up there, see. 
GH: Were these made out of some local wood? 
TB: They were made out of odds and ends. This here was done by 
11 
year old boy, and he gave it to me when he was up here with his 
school group. And they brought me up an azalea plant, I planted 
up 
in the yard. This is back when I was selling furs to Sears and 
Roebuck. This 
is back in the 40s. And that's the tag and stuff 
here. But, this 
is something here that you don't often get a 
chance 
to 
talk 
about. 
3 granddaughters 
and 
3 great 
granddaughters. that's something, 
isn t it? 
GH: 
How 
many 
great 
granddaughters 
do 
you 
have? 
Or, 
greatgrandchildren? 
TB: Got 5. 4 girls and one great grandson. 
GH: Once they start coming they start comin fast. 
TB: Yeah. This is the oldest one - she's goin on 7 now. This is 
a early picture. When she was four months old I carried her in 
Milville Bank, with her mother, and we put a 1000 dollars, out of 
my furs, 
in her name. So 
it's been inthere now, she's going on 7 
years old. This 
is the trapper's prayer, right here. That's the 
one I recited. There's a lot of memories. Now these traps, these 
are all 
antiques. But see 
if they pass this law - this 
is 
the 
hardship--no reimbursment. Right here I got, hangin in here, these 
traps will 
run you better than a thousand dollars. And you should 
see what I got 
in the other rooms there, and on my display. And it's 
the 
law. I know guys that got 10, 
12 thousand dollars wrapped up 
in their traps - antiques, never used - and this law says you 
cannot, 
it's 
a criminal offence to own a steel trap, 
if they pass 
it. And this 
is ridiculous. 
Now here's the fur room. This used to 
be my stable. In here, this was open here, 
in here I stored my 
hay. I've put 40 bales of hay - I had burros and pony. Then 
in 
here was the, where they would come 
in out of the weather - on 
the back 
it had a big, wide door but I put all panelling and 
stuff on here. This 
is the trap most of 
'em are out round 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 39 
different places, 
but these are all waxed, these are last years 
This 
is what I take, see my gloves are 
in here, my trowel. 
GH: About a 5 gallon plastic bucket? 
TB: 5 gallon pail. Here's my trowel. See here's another one I'm 
making here. My grandson, I didn't plan on him being away this 
year, and I was making one for him 
GH: and a hatchet with a hammer head, 
leather strap, rubber 
gloves and a screen. What's the wood frame in there? 
TB: That's just for putting the dirt over the ... 
see here's the 
hatchet for hammering 
GH: For pounding in the stake? 
TB: Yeah. When I get the furs, the raccoon was so much - that's an 
otter there - that's what they look 
like, see his toes and all, 
it s an old mount - I put the coon after he's skinned, over this. 
I'll 
put the apron on. Then I take that piece of tablecloth there 
and put it'so the grease don't come through on my clothes. Then I 
take this knife, and I put paper down here and then I take the 
fat off. 
GH: That's from the inside of the skin? 
TB: Mmhm. You have to be careful how much pressure. Now this just 
goes to show you.. 
GH: 
Is there a special name for this kind of knife? 
TB: A fleshing knife. 
GH: 2 handled. 
TB: Now this here shows how much damage is done to a fox. See 
where - course the bugs got in there, but that's all 
it was, he 
was pinched right across there. You can see, see where the trap 
went across right there? 
GH: When you catch an animal, do you often find that they have 
scars from being in a trap before. 
TB: Definitely. I've caught 13 coon one year that were pegleged 
- one leg was gone where they'd escaped. That's the thing I'm 
tryin to say, 
is where they didn't tend the traps. Now this here, 
I never used to use anything like this - but now I skin the feet out 
on the fox first, and then I put him out on the gamble and hang him, 
see. 
GH: 2 big hooks on either end of a metal frame. Hung up by a 
chain. 
TB: That there you can open it up, you can make it wider. Now 
this, I usually keep this here mowed in the back - but I have so 
darn much here I can't keep up with everything. Here - now this 
is where I demonstrate to the children, 
you know, 
skinning 
muskrats and stuff. I usually keep that all mowed down and have 
grass like out 
in here, but this year it got ahead of me. I want 
to show you something here. Here's my choker I was telling you 
about?  
This deer - I.m not against bow and arrow, archery -
I am against this. I think that they should be taught to trail 
before they're allowed to have a license. Because this deer was 
laying about a hundred yards from the stand where the guy shot 
him. That's a total waste. 
JC: Guy couldn't find him? 
TB: Guy couldn't - I don't think he ever looked. He shot, figured 
he missed 
it. 
GH: You came upon the deer that had the arrow in 
it? 
TB: Yeah, that's what killed 
it. 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 40 
GH: So, normally, they'll get in the stand, climb up 
in a tree? 
TB: That's right (unintell) This 
is mine, I made this. But see 
you could put this over an animal's head, bring this up enough to 
hold him, fold this over, and he can't get away. And you can hold 
him away and walk up and step on the springs and release him. 
GH: So you use that for dogs and? 
TB: Yeah, dog or possum —well, possum you don't need it. A raccoon 
if you wanted to release it, 
you'd have to use something like 
this and then — he'd come tearing after you when you got him out 
of the trap. They re really something. 
GH: What do you do with a coon when you catch one? 
TB: 
Shoot 'em. That's the quickest. I use — you can't carry 
anything bigger than a 22 sure, but I don't take a sure, I take 
what they call a bb cap. It's a thing about this big, and it's 
plenty powerful enough to kill. 
GH: What about a skunk? 
TB: That's when I try to find a pole and I'll walk up the pole 
and then release him and then back down the pole, see. And that's 
when you get the — when they say "The old trapper never dies, he 
just smells that way." 
GH: muskrat, does it have a scent? 
TB: No. They don't have the musk till 
the spring of the year. And 
then you take the glands out, you put 'em in salt, just put a 
little salt in with 'em, and you get 35 dollars a quart for 'em. 
They use 
'em making lure. 
GH: So that's where the lure comes from? 
TB: Yeah, the sac, the glands 
in there. I had just a part of a 
quart and the fur buyer come 
in and he give me 20 dollars for it. 
GH: How many muskrats make a quart? 
TB: They re fair size — the gland 
is about yea 
long, you know. Now 
there's the way the pines were 
in here, see. That's the one I 
set 
GH: What kind of pine is that? 
TB: That's just a bull pine, we call 
'em, jersey pine. But then 
the smooth—bark, goes right up straight with no 
limbs, 
they're much better for lumber. But logs 
like that... That's 
where I set my first trap at the foot of that tree, 
in 1921. 
(unintell) 
GH: 
Is this plant here just a weed or 
is this something you 
planted? 
TB: Nah, that's just a weed coming up. This is one of the feed 
boxes, when I had the pony. We had — she made some jam out of 
some of these peaches, but you can see how the limbs were broke 
off. Kinda weighted down. Now Dad used to have this for a piggery 
back here. Had a brood sow house. I lost forty back here one 
week, put me out of the pig business. 
GH: You lost 40? They got loose? 
TB: No, they got pneumonia. 
GH: So, keeping animals like that is just too much work? 
TB: (Unintell) see this here, know what that comes from? wood 
ashes (unintell)

TXOI:GH: Beginning tape #4. Muriel put all 
her garden produce 
including peppers in the freezer - she says she's got a fortune 
in her freezer. And here's a sign of the garden "Here in my 
garden I spend many an hour, planting my vegetables and my 
flowers. The Lord sends the sunshine and the sunflowers. I 
harvest my vegetables, enjoy the flowers - here I relax and rest 
and enjoy peace and happiness." In the words of our local 
poet .... Yard full 
of eastern grey squirrels - there's one up on 
the red cedar growing here in the back yard next to an old 
antique hulk of a car or truck. Also a lot of bluejays have been 
coming in and out. And here's an aluminum skiff looks like about 
6 feet long, 3 feet across, a foot deep - that's the boat he uses 
when he goes out "trappin' rats". 
TB: 
...you know it's a long bar with a chisel on the end. That's 
what he would out the hole through. He stood 
it up, and when he 
leaned over to 
look see 
if he had a beaver, 
it hit him 
in 
the 
head and stunned him long enough that he drowned. His head was 
froze right in the 
ice under there...I was just showin' him - this 
is 
the big killer up here. You want to see the smaller one for 
muskrat? I'll 
show you. 
GH: OK. Do these have numbers too? 
TB: This here's a 110 killer trap and this 
is what we use for 
muskrats. There they are hangin' there in a bunch. 
GH: Can you stick your hand 
in this one too? 
TB: No. 
I'll 
tell 
you, they really crack your - I have done 
it, 
put a glove on though. They have cracked my knuckles and split 
'em. See here's what happens - the rat goes through here. Now you 
can set 'em in all 
different ways. What I usually do, I set 'em 
in 
this angle, put my stake down through here, catch this jaw so 
it 
doesn't wobble. I always hold my fingers on 
it (GH: It's 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 43 
vertical). This 
is what happens: rat goes in there. (snap). Now 
that's set. See back there, now they're illegal. That's the kind 
they're fightin' against. 
GH: What, the bigger killer traps? 
TB: That's the 220. This 
is the one that.. 
GH: Why are those illegal? 
TB: Because of catchin' dogs 
(unintelligible) Now they all 
are 
legal 
if you got a permit for beaver or otter. But then they use 
that one. I was showin' him the one — that one on the wall out 
there. That thing 
is really bad. 
If a man gets caught in 
it and 
he ain't got help, he's done. 
GH: That's a 220? 
TB: That's a 330. That's a big — I'll bring 
it out. 
GH: That's for beaver? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: But that's outlawed? 
TB: They're not outlawed all 
together — they're outlawed unless 
you got a permit, and they gotta be under water. You take even 
these — now look up on there are the certificates that I won back 
in the old days. They were the best fur received that day at 
Sears and Roebucks, 
in Philadelphia. And they sent me a five 
dollar check each time. They were all won on 65 cent, or 75 cent 
possum. Now these are my old wooden stretchers here, and then the 
wooden stretchers are hung up here. Now I put that thing between 
my — now these are brand new ones, I haven't even undone yet — 
GH: How much do these stretchers cost you? 
TB: Around here, these ones here'll cost you about 22 dollars a 
dozen. But I was at the convention this year and I bought these — 
same thing — 13 dollars a dozen 
GH: Do they have numbers that indicate the size? 
TB: Yeah they're different size. These is the number 5 coon and 
the others 
in the back, you can see these are longer, they're 
fox. You can see how much difference there is. 
GH: So the different shapes are for the different animals and 
different sizes? 
TB: Mmhm. Now this 
is something that you don't see much anymore. 
Now this here 
is a muskrat snare. You put that down like that, 
in 
his run. Then when his head goes through here he tightens it up. 
Like that. 
GH: And you made that yourself? 
TB: Yeah, I made it. And these are legal. There's one of my 
favorites — Abe Lincoln. This 
is somethin' new — they just come 
out with these. I have to rust 'em and go over 'em and all 
GH: By "rust" you mean to dye them? 
TB: Yeah. I'll 
rust 'em up, then dye 'em and wax 
'em. 
I'm gonna use 
these for coon. These are better yet, because they're light and 
they will hold. And another thing — a coon will foot himself — he 
will 
reach underneath a big jaw, 
like a number 2, 
and cut that 
foot off. This you can see is a ideal trap for a... 
GH: 
Is that a number 1? 
TB: This 
is a 1. The one I showed you up 
in the house was a one 
and a half. 
GH: To rust em up, that means you let the rust develop. Why do 
you do that? 
TB Mmhm. To get the wax to hold they gotta be rusty. Now here, 
in 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 44 
here, these are my tags. Here's one you can drop 
in your pocket. 
GH: Does the state issue these or do you make them? 
TB: No. These come from Pennsylvania. Stanley Hawbaker makes em 
for me. Out in Ft. Loden, Pennsylvania. 
GH: They stamp your name on there? 
TB: Stamp your name. These are the push pins — I use, 
if you 
notice the boards in between there, I hate to pull them. After 
you take all 
the pains to get a fur nice, then to put these wire 
prongs down through the tail 
or through the feet, 
it burns me up 
because you're puttin' a hole 
in there. Don't hurt the fur but the 
look. So I put these boards, and you see how I got 'em wired on 
here? And I fix all my stretchers on that way. Then I use the 
push pins. And I push them in to hold the tail and the feet. 
GH: Those are metal push pins? 
TB: Yeah. With a steel prong. So I use these and 
it makes it a 
lot better. 
GH: What's this block and tackle thing hanging up above? 
JC: For hauling deer up. Cranks it up. 
TB: Don't get none of this on. 
GH: This 
is the 
lure — this 
is fox lure? 
TB: Yeah — just take a whiff. 
GH: Whew. Amazing. 
TB: 
It's all 
ready. 
GH: How much is a bottle of that? 
TB: This here I got off of Frank Terry — 
JC: What's that smell supposed to be? 
TB: That's skunk. You can smell 
it. That's a call 
lure. Now you 
put that to call the animal 
in — you see how that's circulated 
around? And you can imagine when you got some of that hangin' on 
your hip. We had some of the kids have broke a bottle 
in the 
house — and maybe they didn't catch it. Anyhow, this I was tellin 
you about — the walkin' stick. Now this 
is a stick that the 
beaver, see how the beaver cleaned the bark off. That was a meal 
for the beaver. See how that's wore. But we carry that — now like 
I say with the dog, I put a wire noose on there, just put it on 
his nose and pushed him away. This here — when the season comes 
in, 
that'll go with me. On the trap line. These here are — these 
I make myself. These are the diving traps. The muskrat, they're 
used to pushing through the mud. Now I just found out — you can 
learn every day, you can learn something. So I found out this 
year that — see the tag fastened on — why, this young trapper, he 
takes these and he drops 'em 
in gasoline with roofing tar, and 
that puts a coat on there and they never rust. And see they go 
in 
here — you can catch more than one rat, 
if another one comes 
along — so they drown. It's a homemade, but it's a good trap. 
JC: 
Is that legal now? 
TB: Oh yeah. They're legal. These are the muskrat stretchers 
hangin' here. Usually — you know last year I loaned 'em to a boy 
and — but these traps, these are a different type from the one I 
showed you 
in the house. See these are wider. I don't like them 
as well, but I had a chance to buy 
'em reasonable so I bought a 
bunch of 
'em. 
GH: Has a wider guard. 
TB: Yeah. The wider guard allows sometimes for the rat to go 
through. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 45 
GH: Now how do you decide to set this kind of 
live trap or... 
TB: Anywhere where the muskrat has a run. In the water where it's 
run nin'. 
GH: So you prefer to use these where there's a run? 
TB: I don't use 
'em too much on the meadow, because there's not 
too many - I don't know, for some reason I use 'em 
in the ponds 
more, where there's holes, see. 
GH: How deep do you set them? 
TB: Oh, they go - sometimes you set 'em maybe 12 to 18 inches 
deep. It's accordin' to where you can see the run, how deep 
it 
is. 
GH: Do you get muskrat where the tide comes in? 
TB: That's what it's called, tidal meadow, where I trap stake.. 
GH: So you set these at low tide? 
TB: Yeah. Set all 
your traps at low tide. And then you tend 'em at 
next low tide. You want me to bring this outside? 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: What do you call 
this machine here? 
TB: Fleshing beam. I just made one for my cousin's boy - they do 
quite a lot of trapping. They never used to flesh his coon, and 
his coon was practically worthless, because - with that fat, see, 
they'll burn and taint. So anyhow I made one and, oh my gosh I 
made 
it for him the year before last, and the last couple years 
they been doin' 
really nice work on their fur. So I just made one 
the other day for the young man that caught the 21 fox, and I 
gave 
it to him, and then I did all 
his traps for him too. He"s 
the one dropped me off the two load of wood when I really needed 
it. 
You can see what the squirrel will do to a mount - see how 
they chew all 
the hide off the nose and around the eyes? 
GH: That was before you got to the animal? 
TB: No, that's after it's mounted - in the cabin. 
GH(aside) This fleshing board 
is 2 by 8, 2 by 6, 
inserted 
in a 
hole at about a 60 degree angle and tapered at the upper end. 
About 3 feet long - the upright piece, and the horizontal piece 
about 2 and a half feet, mounted on two stumps, about a foot 
high. 
TB: This - my brother got this deer had a lot of white in 
it -
see the white feet of the deer? So I made it 
into a (unintell) 
Yeah I cut a couple pieces of wood and put it on. I do an awful 
lot of, you know, makin' different stuff. I tell you, I have these 
books that go back to 1926 -this is a '36 here. In here, here's 
the traps you see up on the wall, see 'em here? Those ones right 
the re . 
GH: These are Gibbs 2 trigger traps. 
TB: Mmhm. 
GH: How old are they? 
TB: 
1919, 1920 and 1924. These here, some of these go way back. 
That one don't go back as far. Here's a home-mader - was made by 
a blacksmith - who, I don't know. Now a trap like this - see, 
here's where the chain was on here - that's wore through. A trap 
like that was used for otter or beaver. Here's a trap here, 
this'd is the most valuable one 
in here. See that's called a 
alligator. That's just a name - the jaws open up, see, 
like 
this... 
GH: And the teeth kind of hook together. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 46 
TB: Yeah. That was made by the alligator trap company. This here 
- an antique dealer came in, 
he said "Boy, I'd love to have those 
- they're the original" I said "They oughta be, I made 'em". This 
- I'll show you - we used to use the muzzle loader like this, but 
then a fire ( ). See, that's antler too. 
GH:(aside) Antler for the plug on the horn. Powder horn. 
TB: Now I have 
in that cabinet where you took the picture there, 
the guns 
in the other room - that flask 
is the original powder. 
Now that flask there'll go back to the revolution. Yup. Real old 
one. I had another one, 
in the other cabin back here, and 
it 
disappeared. That one's really - brass, you know, with the 
animals on 
it, 
and somebody got it. So then that's when I started 
takin' the traps and stuff out. This is the different 
organizations I belong to... 
GH: That little container here - what's that? 
TB: That's make your suds - that's soap 
in there, and you used to 
put it 
in 
the warm water with your wash pan and shake it back and 
forth and make your suds. You didn't have the detergents them 
days 
GH: For cleaning skins? 
TB: No, just for dishes 
GH: Do you wash the skins after you flesh 'em? 
TB: No - the only way you would wash would be maybe to wash mud -
out of a fox or somethin' that got muddy 
in the field. Now if you 
notice here, see here, the stain on 
it, 
right on each side here, 
right on here? That deer put its head down to - you know, 
in a 
clump of that Indian grass comin' up 
in the spring - and when he 
raised his head he 
left both his antlers stickin' right in 
the 
dirt. 
GH: They came off? 
TB: They came off. Now this one here... 
GH: So you found 'em, just upside down in the dirt? 
TB: Yeah, now this one up here, the granddaughter was on her way 
to school 
in 
1967, and - she's 26 now - and the deer was feeding. 
Snow on the ground, and 
it was feeding, up 
in the cedar trees -
cause when there's snow they'll feed on cedar browse, on this 
upland cedar. And when he dropped down, he 
left his antler hangin' 
in the tree. And she picked 
it up and brought it 
in and I put her 
name on 
it and I hung it up there. These are my - my boy, he 
left 
here 
in 
'69 and that was his hunting license over there. That 
skunk has been on that stretcher for thirty-some years. 
GH: That's a skunk? 
TB: Umhm - that's the way they look. on there. I put it on there, 
and 
it's held up all 
this time. I just hang it up 
in here for the 
looks, you know. I did all this stone work. 
GH: So you skin out skunks sometimes? 
TB: I used to, not no more. 
GH: No market for it now? 
TB: No. The market is 
low and I don't really need to take the 
animal so I release 'em. But you take with the skunks - at one 
time, 
in 
the winter, I skinned out 37 - and that put a lot of 
food on the table. 
At that time they were bringin' anywhere from 
three and a half to five, six dollars. 
GH: You didn't eat the skunk? 
TB: No - there 
is people that eat 'em. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs

GH: The musk

-that's to

GH: How much

root of the tail. There's a man for that 
lure. Now in back here I had 
it covered 
do you get for it? 
TB: Oh, 
it's awful high now, for that stuff you know. You get 
quite a lot. I put all 
stone up here, put this here to keep any 
fire from starting. 
GH: 
Is this the wood stove that Muriel started out on? 
TB: Yeah, she cooks out here. She comes out - you can feel a 
little heat in there, I burned paper in there this morning. Now, 
this heats nice and I have one young man, he comes out here 
sometimes when it's trappin' season and he'll stay here. And my 
two grandsons, they used to put up back here. So you wanta get 
that picture, and I'll show you the other one back there. Like I 
said, there's so much to see here. 
GH: What's the story behind this turtle here? 
TB: That turtle was a 47 pounder. 
GH: Snapper? 
TB: Snapper, and I went snapperin' with a fellow this year, and I 
really had a ball. 
Want me to get a couple traps? This 
is the 
bucket. I'll get a couple traps... 
Come back any time in the fall 
GH: 
I'd like to come back 
in December, my next trip here and 
maybe you can show me how you do 
it. 
TB: Glad to. 
GH: 
Is that your corn out there in the field? 
TB: That's what's left of the sugar corn. The dry weather hit, we 
didn't get too much but we did get some off of it, 
for the 
children. But you know when the children come here, on a bus trip 
- they've never been

ve to - and I carry a vest right with 
years of foolin' around I never learned 
up 
in May, and the water was very cold 
in the spring of the year - and we was 
we hit a, 
either a telegraph pole or a 
to the air, and 
it swerved first one 
boat, then she went over and I left 
ocassette logs 
page 48 
it. 
I didn't have no vest on (unintelligible) from here to that 
building, 
in a boat, and I thought he'd swing around and pick me 
up, 
you know, but he don't have no motor. (unintelligible) And he 
was throwin' cushions, and I told him I said ain't no use throwin' 
them cushions, I can't reach 'em. So you know I survived in that 
water from 12 to 15 minutes, just takin' a deep breath and then I'd 
go down under and then I'd come back up again. And the water, 
the cold was gettin' to me. Anyhow, I came up and I guess about 
from here to that old tractor, homemade tractor over there, was a 
boat, four men 
in 
it. He said, Catch the life—ring. I said, 
Brother I can't catch nothin', I've had 
it. When I hit the water, 
the first thing I said was, I'm dead. And as I went under I said, 
Lord help me. Well I musta had help, because at that time I was 
70, 71 practically, and to survive that long — but I didn't 
panic, I figured I was dead, what's the use of fightin' 
it? So, 
the panic 
is what does it. So I came up and, one guy on the boat 
he was off a disabled boat, he said, hold on, and I seen him back 
up and jump. Well 
he was, he weighed 245 at least. Clothes and 
all 
he came over, and I thought boy, 
if I can only come up one 
more time he'll be here. And when I come up, he's behind me and 
he said, I'm behind you and the ring's in front of you, grab it. 
I just reached out and put my arms through it. That's the first 
time I took in any water, cause when they pulled it put my head 
under. So they said, call ashore and had the ambulance waitin', 
said we got a man here that needs hospitalization. I said who? 
me? Not me, all I need's to get ahold that boat. Got ahold of 
it 
and one guy said — we's comin' 
in you know and he said, hey, we 
know you. I said, where you fellows from? And he said, up here 
outside of Camden there. He said, you got a Dodge? 77 four wheel 
drive? I said, yes. He said, Tom Brown? I said, yes. He said, You 
caught us stealin' wood — they were cuttin back there, all 
I said 
was hey boys, be careful, you get caught a little bit further 
then you're on state and you got a problem. So I told 'em, I said 
well boys, this year if you need wood drive 
in the yard, I'll 
give 
it to you. 
GH: Yeah, I bet. 
TB: 
It's funny — you know when you been around that way you, I 
don't know, I guess you're just taught to survive. That's the 
reason I tell 
the — you wanta see the other one, the other 
building? Get these lights out. Wait'll you see the other one. 
GH: What's this bush here? 
TB: That's gooseberry. 
GH: You plant those to eat? 
TB: Yeah. Did you see my doorstop? 
GH: Yeah, I noticed. 
TB: I spend quite a lot of time — if 
it's real bad and I come in 
late from settin traps then I take (unintelligible) 
GH(aside): Door stop made of an old metal wagon wheel attached to 
a pipe that goes in the ground. You can turn 
it one way to hold 
the door open, the other way to close the door. 
TB: 
...that don't have the berries on. I have one up 
in the back 
yard with the berries. 
GH: Does this holly grow out in the woods? 
TB: Yeah, oh, beautiful 
in the woods. 
GH: How do you use the berries? 
Hunn--B4 Audiocassette logs 
page 48 
TB: We don't use the berries for anything. I 'II 
tell you they 
make feed for the deer and they make feed for the grouse - all 
kinds of birds. I just want to show you 
if I can see 'em here -
here's the teaberry leaves. I don't see no berries. That's 
teaberry leaves. 
GH: 
looks like (unintell) 
TB: berries back here. I found some the other day out at the 
jamboree. If I can find one with the berries, I'll 
get you some 
with berries. 
GH: This 
is for tea? 
TB: Tea, yeah you can make tea. 
GH: That's sassafras there? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: Maybe I'll take a little bit more teaberry. What else 
is 
growing 
in here - huckleberries or blueberries? 
TB: There's the cultivated - I got a whole patch of 'em out there. 
When we come back from here, we'll take a walk. Here's one with 
one on 
it - just a small one there. That's the teaberry. 
GH: They don't call 
it winterberry? 
TB: I got one for you, got a nice one. 
GH: You take the berries to make tea, or the whole plant? 
TB: Just the leaves. Those teaberries, they're good tastin'. 
GH: So you do eat the berries too? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: 
Is this huckleberry growing here? 
TB: This is what we call Hogs huckleberry. You cook them and feed 
em to the hogs. They're not a very - they;re big seed and they 
get wormy. 
GH: So you don't eat them? 
TB: No. The small huckleberries is your best berry. Up here -
what makes your best huckleberry or blueberry, upland, 
is fire. 
The fire goes through and then after that the berries really come 
on 
GH: Has this plant got a name or do you use 
it? 
TB: I imagine 
it does. 
It has a little flower on 
it. But I don't 
know what it 
is. That's one thing I never studied much was the 
plant life. Tell you what we do have, they'll be comin' up pretty 
quick and I think they are part of the mushroom family, that's 
the indian pipes. Have you seen those, they look just like a 
peace pipe. Come up all 
over this place. Now the boys'II be 
in 
here before deer season. They'll come 
in here, clean all this up. 
This 
is where I come through with the four wheel drive and go up 
to get my firewood. You can tell that wind was powerful when 
it 
come through, cut the top out of that. 
JC: Do you eat those mushrooms at all, the indian pipes? 
TB: No, I don't think they're edible. But we do have mushrooms 
here. I never bother with mushrooms either. We have people that 
come here and they gather the mushrooms - I was thinkin' of one of 
'em this morning. He passed away this past year. This will 
be all 
raked up, 
it'll 
be clean, there'll be a 32 foot mobile home back 
there, and they'll really have 
it all 
ready for in 
the deer 
season. 
GH: So you set it up 
like that for the deer season? 
TB: Yeah, they'll have everything all 
set up for deer season. 
Like I said, I don't hunt with 'em anymore - I used to hunt out of 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 50 
here regular, but I just let my nephew have 
it. Watch your head. 
GH: So the deer hunters, they're part of your trapping club? 
TB: Well, they're my nephews, mostly, nephews and my brother with 
em. 
GH: Do they drive the deer? 
TB: Yeah. Well, not any more. I used to drive, but mostly now 
it's 
tend of side one) 
TB: I built this out of odds and ends, for my boy — I got the 
light on 
in here now. This one ain't much, too much of a light. 
But they gather here — there's more deer killed sittin' around 
in 
here talkin' than what there 
is 
in the woods. These are mine 
in 
here, these antlers around in here and 
in there. But in the back 
room, these — I don't think I got any 
in the back room. This was 
broke into one time and — you see the burn marks in here — they 
burnt the pictures right off the wall, set 'em on fire you know. 
GH: Just vandals? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: Who would do that? 
TB: Well, they were just youngsters 
I think. Now if you feel 
these, that's got velvet on. That's the way they are 
in velvet. 
This deer was shot ahead of the — when they used to have the coal 
burners. Locomotive. The train crew used to ride ouA on the cow— 
catcher with a shotgun, then they'd kill 
the deer and load 
'em up 
in 
the engine and nobody would ever know it, 
see. That was after 
waterin' died 
GH: 
Is this eight point? 
TB: That's nine I believe. I think it's nine. 
GH: What do they call this? 
TB: They're little spikes killed with a bow. 
GH: Spike—bucks. 
TB: Yeah. This 
is a forkhorn. 
GH: How old are they when they get spikes? 
TB: 
'bout first year — or second year buck, rather. 
GH: Spike—buck, forkhorn, and then you go on to 5? 
TB: That's when it's shed, yeah. See, these are mine here. 
GH: What's the most points you've ever seen? 
TB: The one — oh, 
I've seen 'em with 23. 
GH: 23 points? 
TB: Yeah, but the most I ever was the one up 
in there, the big 
rack 
in 
the other cabin — that's 11. See, this here has to be 
cleaned out, where the moisture's been 
in — but they have the 
freezer and everything. They take everything out and they clean 
it all 
up 
GH: Do you hunt deer at all 
yourself? 
TB: Oh yeah. 
GH: How many deer, say, 
in a year do you usually shoot? 
TB: Well, you're allowed, now you're allowed two, with a shotgun, 
and 
if you have a muzzleloader — actually, I think you can get 6 
or 7 deer, 
if you got all 
the different licenses. At one time, 
the meat meant a lot to us, because when we raisin the potatoes, 
but to tell you the truth any more, we don't eat much of 
it. We 
ate 
it when we had to, 
see, and that's the thing 
GH: You don't particularly care to eat the venison? 
TB: Yeah, you want to see the one that looked like a Indian, 
look 
Hunn--64 Audiocassette logs 
page 51 
here - that's my brother. He was all Indian. His father's looks, 
see. And this 
is my nephew here. And this is the beaver hide I 
was tellin' you about, that cost me the fine - that's the picture 
(?) right there. But you can see how that was skinned really 
nice. 
GH: 
Is this you? 
TB: Umhm, this's my nephew. That's 1952. This was taken 
in 
Germany. He killed that one 
in Germany while he was still 
in the 
army, you know, they was still fightin', and the war ended, he got 
home 
in 
time to kill 
one 
in season that year. This 
is the rope, 
they carried that in their coat you know for bringin' their deer 
out. This 
is 
the nephew up there with the bear. That's Vermont. 
Here's the same picture over here, taken. But here's this freak 
horn - look at this one here. Look on this side, and look - spike 
on the other. There's several freak horns here. 
GH: So do these count as a point or not? 
TB: Yeah, they would count 'em, a lot of 
'em would count 'em, but I 
don't count nothin' 
like this here. I would count here, see, but 
the others I wouldn't count. There's another freak back there. 
Now this here, I built this for my boy. They had a lot of fun 
with that, before he grew up. One night - I used to have a Jap 
sword brought back from the islands during the war, and - you 
wouldn't hardly believe it - I give 2 dollars off a guy, he 
wanted money, brought the sword back. Can you imagine sellin' a 
sword like that and my boy, I took 
it when I went to California, 
put 
it 
in a coat in the back of the car, 
in the trunk - I took 
it 
out to him cause he always wanted it. I come near takin' his life 
once from blood poisoning. Anyhow he took it to a Jap out there 
and asked him about it, 
and there was writing on there. And this 
young Japanee offered him 500 dollars for it. He said, I'll give 
you 500 any time you want to sell 
it. My boy was layin' 
in here, 
and I had muzzleloaders and everything back here till they broke 
in, 
and then I took the stuff out. So my boy was layin' 
on the 
couch asleep, and one of the boys pulled this sword out - boy, 
that thing was like this - and he 
laid 
it on his bare feet, and 
the boy never moved. So then he took up and 
laid 
it on his cheek, 
and when he did my boy threw his hand up 
like that to ward 
it 
off, and 
it cut him right to the bone. So he went into the 
hospital - he pushed his brother in 
law's car out of the driveway 
so they wouldn't hear the car, and they went up to the hospital 
and they had 
it sewed. When he told me about it the next day, I 
said, boy did you get shot? He said, no. So another day went by, 
I said, boy, get in there. I said, you're gettin' blood poisoning. 
Kid said, Since when did you become a doctor. I said, boy, 
I've 
been around long enough to know infection. And it started to pull 
the stitches, so he went in. But that -he had a bad hand on him. 
So there was a lotta fun. That's a nice stove, when they get that 
one goin' 
in here. Then they had the oil 
in the other. Sometimes 
in 
the winter time, why, rats 
is comin' 
in fast and furious, and I 
don't have time to skin 'em, 
I'll throw 'em 
in the top there and 
boy they'll freeze. 
EH: Can you freeze them, and 
it doesn't hurt the skin? 
TB: 
It don't hurt the skin, but you don't use the meat after it's 
- if they're, 
any animal that's froze with the intestines in 
it, 
I won't eat. 
Has to be thoroughly cleaned and I will 
not 
sell 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 52 
anybody 
anything 
that I wouldn't eat myself. 
No way. 
But 
you 
notice here, 
these 
is what they wrote in here. 
See, 
the 
guy's 
were 
up 
in the woods playing cards. 
Says Tom Brown's ( ), 
then 
they 
got 
"scram" 
and did you read 
this, 
what 
it 
says, 
the 
starting hour, starting time 7:30 AM, morning coffee break 3 to 
11:30, 11:30 to 1:30 lunch hour, afternoon coffee 
GH: 2 to 4:30. 
TB: 
It only gives 'em about a hour and a half gunnin' all 
day. 
GH: Hunting schedule. 
TB: Mmhm. Oh, that's it, 
that "Deer hunt" Alarm clock rings, and 
all 
that kind of stuff. They got all kinds stuff here. 
GH: So these are your kids, your nephews' wall hangings? 
TB: Yeah. See, that taxidermist there, his card right there, Bob 
Eisel. He's the one caught the record bass back here, 10 pounds 
something. Right back of the house here. Now you come down, why 
we could take a ride around the woods with the four wheel drive 
and you could really see some area here. This 
is 
right in here, 
these two bucks. 
JC: Does this thing work? 
TB: Yeah. They put it there. Look at this guy, shootin' with his 
feet, no arms. Yeah, they cut all 
kinds of things out. 
GH: This taxidermist, 
is he still 
in business? 
TB: Oh yeah. 
GH: Leesburg, New Jersey? 
TB: Yeah, he's a young man. 
In here 
GH: Phone 603-785-1505. Bob Eisel. A taxidermist — there's a 
price list effective '72 on the wall. He's still 
in business. 
TB: Friend of mine, he 
lives 
in Bridgeton. During the war, he was 
missin' 
in action. And his uncle was my brother in 
law, 
he cane 
over and he's cryin', and he said, Dutch is gone — that was his 
nickname — he says, Dutch is gone, they haven't heard from him 
and they notified he's missin' 
in action. I said, He'll show up, 
Han (?), don't worry about it. The closest the two of us was 
together, 
if 
he was dead, I'd know it. And I said, He ain't dead. 
Bout a week later, he showed up. I asked him one time, I said, 
what happened Dutch? All 
he would say — They got thick and we got 
thin. 155 — 15 lived to get back, out of a company. And he was 
one of 
'em and 
it was through, from tree to tree and crawlin' that 
he worked his way back. So that was Thanksgivin', and deer season 
was 17th then here. He got one right through here and 
it cut all 
the nerves so that he had to have a spring on his foot and he's 
waitin' to go back in the hospital now to have another artificial 
hip put in. But he's a big man. 
JC: From the war, he got shot in the leg? 
TB: Yeah. And he had to wear this spring to bring his foot — but 
he was a tractor and trailer driver till, I think he was, he's 
just turned 70 
in August, and we been friends since he was nine 
years old and I was 12. 
GH: Was this World WarI1 when this happened? 
TB: Yes, World War II. Here's another one of the soldier boys, 
here. 
It was his brother I was tellin' you about got killed when 
they tripped the bombbay doors on him. So what I usually do now, 
since they broke in, when I pull 
this switch here I take and 
loosen this (GH: the fuse). They think there's somethin' wrong 
with 
it, 
they don't have sense enough to turn that in, 
cause they 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 53 
hooked up electric plates, there's a electric plate here 
somewhere — they hooked it up right in one of these chairs. If 
it'd been juiced, why it would have gone. But there was matches 
all 
over — one thing they did do — when they started the fire, 
they turned the fire extinguisher on and put the fire out. The 
boys used to have a table here and they used to play cards here, 
you know. Here they set the TV and they listened when they come 
out. They'll be here Thanksgivin' Day, gettin' things ready. One 
boy said, I wish that darn deer'd quit starin' over my shoulder. 
He was readin' his cards, he said. Well, they're all gettin' up 
in 
years now, the youngest one of 
'em 
is I think 56, but when He was 
16 he killed his first deer with me, see, so 
GH: And they still come back here. That's when the deer season 
opens. after Thanksgiving? 
TB: 
It used to be at that time, but now I think 
it opens up the 
first week 
in December. Used to be from the 17th to the 21st 
regardless. You might even get a Sunday in on that. This is the 
path when we head for the deer hunt — see the path goes right up 
through there. I tell you, 
it's nice and quiet and peaceful back 
here, 
it really is. Here's the post office back 
in the laurel — 
the toilet. Oh, here's more — look at these. Oh man 
GH: Teaberry 
TB: Look there's a double one. 
GH: Normally they only have one berry per plant? 
TB: That's a nice big one. There, you can put 'em right in your 
pocket. 
GH: What's this clump of bushes out here? 
TB: That's laurel. I tell you that's laurel — we call 
it laurel 
here. 
In Virginia they call 
it 
ivy. I don't know how they ever 
get that, but that's what they call 
it. But that's our laurel. 
One time they had a dinner back here for some of their family — 
my nephews' 
in—laws. Well, the ladies had to go to the toilet. 
They didn't know, but there's — to keep 
it cool, they had a big 
buck deer hangin' 
in there. The men, 
if they had to go to the 
toilet would go out here, you know. Anyhow, they didn't know that 
deer was there — I guess when the women opened that door, that 
door opening caused the buck to swing right out. They never 
stopped, they come right back 
in the cabin again. 
GH: Lot of good stories from your hunting. 
TB: Oh yeah. 
GH: Are there any other plants around here, things you make some 
use of? 
TB: I don't know, 
let's walk around here. See 
if there's any 
Indian pipes comin' 
up. 
GH: 
Is this this turkey beard? 
TB: I don't know what they call that, some call 
it oyster grass, 
something like that. But they had their outside light, when that 
high wind, come off. You see the bark off the tree there, that's 
where they shoot with the muzzle loader, see, with the rifle. 
That's gonna be fire wood one of these days, I guess. 
GH: What's this bush here? 
TB: That's just — I don't know what it 
is but it grows wild here. 
GH: Any berries on 
it or anything? 
TB: No. I think it's a little early for... 
JC: Well, 
it's a little dry now too, they need it a little wet. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 54 
TB: 
I did 
see 
some 
puffballs 
comin' 
up 
here 
this 
morning 
somewheres I was walkin' around. It won't be 
long before they... 
JC: 
They're all over where we are too. 
The mushrooms now are 
in 
the pine forests. 
I don't think there's too much 
in this type of 
woods right now. 
TB: 
See, there's teaberry leaves all 
over. Sometimes, we used to 
go out and we would pick those, 
oh a pint or two of the berries. 
You 
know I got man-made soles on these boots, 
and 
if they don't 
get 
all messed up. 
In the spring of the year we'd come out 
and 
there'd be all flowers all over there. 
They were pretty. There's 
a real 
piece 
of sassafras. 
Out here I'll 
show 
you 
the 
size 
they're comin' up 
in the blueberries (unintelligible) 
GH: A depression plow - an old model A retooled. 
(Tape 
is unintelligible here) 
TB: This year we had the wet and then we had the dry weather. I 
could show you across the road. A wild turkey. 
GH: You got wild turkeys around here? 
TB: Oh yeah. 
GH: Where'd they come from? 
TB: They let 'em out here. They restocked it. See where the 
moles ... but this year we had the dry weather and we didn't get no 
crop, but I have seen some years when I'd take 700 quarts out of 
here. 
JC: What are these flowers here? 
TB: Morning glories. There's where pumpkin came up wild, didn't 
do nothing. 
GH: What's this grass you got growing? 
TB: This is wild oats. See the seed. 
GH: Do birds eat that? 
TB: Oh yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of 
GH: Hey there's a woodcock. 
TB: Yeah, a doodlebird. 
GH: Do hunters go after them around here? 
TB: Oh yeah. See this grass. 
GH: What's this flower? 
TB: Oh that's a wild flower. We have all kinds here. I have books 
on 
'em but I never bothered too much (Tape 
is 
unintelligible) .... take 
it home and put it 
in a vase, 
it'll 
last 
for years, just like this here. My wife's got it 
in the house 
from a couple years ago 
GH: Does 
it has a name? 
TB: I imagine, but I don't know what it 
is. Like I said, 
if 
it's 
a plant, I don't know too much about it. I know some, but some of 
the others I don't know. 
GH(aside): a light daisy-like plant. 
TB: 
...from the house all 
the way up to the daughter's. Then, I 
told the son-in-law, I said, plant it 
in trees. So I put it 
in 
trees (unintelligible) 
GH: Scotch pine? 
TB: Yeah. Then they got some... 
GH: Can they sell that scotch pine then, to nursery people? 
TB: No, what people go for is Christmas trees, they come 
out 
their own. Now one morning - see this hole right down 
in here?-
one morning I had a red fox there and right there where that tree 
is 
on the daughter's lawn I had one there. Over here 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 55 
(unintelligible) was a doggoned deer. When you get out here 
you'll see. Look where they're eatin' the vines, see. 
GH: The deer have been doing that? 
TB: Yeah, you'll see their tracks all 
around in here. They've eat 
these vines - see the tracks here? 
GH: What can you tell from those tracks? Can you tell what kind 
of deer it 
is? 
TB: They say you can. I usually tell 
if they spread out when they 
step. Usually the buck'II spread out. Lots of people say you 
can't tell 
and others say you can. Now, before you go, 
if you'd 
like some of them fryin' peppers, I'll 
pick you some. See them 
over here. Now that I would say was a buck - see how it spreads 
out? See over here how he's spread out when he turned? I lost all 
of my pumpkins this year to the deer. I got one under that basket 
big enough to make a pie or so. Over here is where I had the 
watermelons. There was a dozen tomatoes there - I never got a 
tomato off of 
'em. Deer eat every one of 
'em. Now this 
is a 
beautiful home here. 
GH: That's your daughter's house? 
TB: I give her an acre of ground there. 
In back of the garage 
where you see the truck they got a 10,000 dollar swimmin' pool. 
It's beautiful. They got a deck, you know, 
it's really nice. 
GH: 
Is this a weed here? 
TB: That's ragweed. 
GH: Amaranthus it 
looks like. 
TB: I had beans 
in here, spring beans, and this 
is what's came up 
from the seed. And then I had the squash here. See they're still 
bearin' squash. Now there's those peppers if you want, I'll 
get 
you some. They're fryin' peppers (unintelligible) I never picked 
beans in October before, or peppers or anything. Usually the 
frost had killed it. There's another (unintelligible) 
GH: What kind of squash 
is that? 
TB: Zucchini. I'll show you up here. I still come out here now -
I'll come out here and pick some of the green tomatoes, maybe 
like this one here, and I'll 
put 'em down the outside cellar 
there. I counted on this but then the deer got into 'em - I had 
gourds out here. This is what I made this year out of an old tank 
- I cut 
it with a saber saw with a ( )blade and that's where I do 
my traps. And that's the nicest part - when it boils it don't 
boil over - that comes right up and goes right back in. Follows 
the contour of the tank. 
GH: What do you use this for? 
TB: Boilin' the traps, dyeing 'em. I use that for dyin', and when I 
had 
GH: 
It's an old water heater, 
looks like, with the side cut out. 
TB: Yeah. Here's the traps, right here. 
GH: Turned on 
its side. 
TB: Here are the dyed muskrat traps. These here 
is my coon traps 
and my muskrat traps. This is one of my poems here: " Here 
in my 
garden I spend many an hour, planting my vegetables and my 
flowers. The Lord sends the sunshine and the shower. I harvest my 
vegetables, enjoy my flower. Here I relax and rest, enjoy peace 
and happiness." 
GH: That's nice. Inspires you when you're working in the garden. 
TB: Course there's some around here that I borrowed from other 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 56 
gardens, 
like the one here 
Come from Florida. 
GH: This bush? 
TB: No, the poem here. "Kiss of the sun for pardon the birds for 
mirth (?) you're closer to God 
in the garden than any place on 
earth" 
GH: You see that in somebody's garden down 
in Florida? 
TB: Yeah, 
in 
the Sarasota Gardens 
MB: Did you see 
it all? 
GH: I don't know if we've seen 
it all, but we saw a lot of 
it. 
TB: There's quite a lot yet, Mom. 
MB: Have you seen the museum? 
TB: Oh yeah, we went through there. 
MB: 
Isn't that buffet pretty. You know a man offered us 45 
dollars for that. And a man come here and a woman come here and 
said that it was worth a thousand to 12 hundred dollars. 
GH: That antique... 
MB: Big (unintelligible). This antique man said, my god that's 
worth at least a thousand dollars, he said 
it could be worth 
1500. He says, I'd have to look 
in my book. Why, 45.00, do they 
think they're talking to some kind of, I don't know what. That's 
beautiful. Solid oak, you know. 
GH: Sounds like they wanted to rip you off. 
MB: I would say that. They're not rippin' me off. He's got a lot 
of nice valuable things in there. 
TB: How's the soup comin'? 
MB: 
It's all 
done, 
it's finished. 
TB: ... so he headed down the track — he called the airport and 
when he come down here he come out of the woods with his 
parachute pack hid 
in the back, and so he took him on down to the 
plant and called in. But I was still workin', I run the dryer at 
that time back there. And I'm out on the platform, I heard the 
roar of the plane comin'. The stack 
is up there 66 feet, and one 
of 
'em's right on a level for that stack. I was about ready to 
jump and 
to and behold he just pulled that stick back and he 
climbed that stack just like that. Boy, he was too close for 
comfort, I'll 
tell 
you. But one of 
'em crashed in the lake and was 
killed, and one of 
'em crashed out on the upshootem road, he just 
made a big hole 
in the ground when he come down. Another one 
crashed down 
in the marsh, he went down so deep they never did 
get him. You come down 
in a power dive in that meadow, you go 
deep. We had one crashed here some time ago, and 
it had — I don't 
know, four people on 
it. 
And just the tail 
stuck out. Guy was 
snafflin' 
(?) and he seen the tail this summer. They went out 
there, 
it took 
'em days just to get the bodies, they were that 
deep. 
GH: Was that Air Force plane? 
TB: No, this was a private plane. Two couples on their way back 
to Virginia. And they crashed. This 
is the 
GH(aside) He was explaining about the smoke bomb that he used on 
his wind chime out here, said they used to drop them out here 
practicing during the war, World War II. What's that. 
TB: I said there's the wood I'm gettin' for winter. Now tomorrow 
I'll 
go 
in the woods again, see, and start cuttin. 
GH: How many cords do you use a year? 
TB: I imagine around five. Easy. We're the only place that can 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs

open the back door and heat the outside, because we burn wood. 
And 
it gets hot. I don't know whether (unintelligible) We'll just 
see. 
GH: Your fishpond? 
TB: Yeah. It's full 
of frogs, but — it's cold, I don't see any of 
them. One day, why I had company here and they said, what 
happened to the frogs, they were here a minute ago? I looked 
around, I said, there's your reason. Right over there. There was 
a black snake over there. 
GH: What kind of snakes do you have around here? 
TB: We have — I've never seen a poison snake, except once and 
that was down on the dikes where I trapped. 
GH: Was that a rattlesnake? 
TB: Mmhm. That's the only one I ever seen. I've been blueberrying 
with the wife and I said, come on, 
let's get out of here. She 
said, why? Let's go — cause I smell 
'em. I got that odor, you 
know, 
like fresh cut cucumbers. And we got out of there. 
GH: Rattlesnake smells that way? 
TB: Yeah. They have an odor to 
'em. 
GH: But the other snakes smell different? 
TB: No, they — I have these great—grandchildren, they'll handle 
snakes. They don't have no fear, because I told 'em and I let them 
take ahold of a little snake and 
let 'em rub 
it. This is, 
see here 
and here, that's pine. You couldn't blame the snake — they're 
harmless. I had him in a truck, 
in a dump truck, workin' all 
day 
and playin' around with him, I threw him on the kitchen floor and 
my wife run in and slammed the door and I went to get him and he 
grabbed me first. 
GH: How long was the pine snake? 
TB: The pine snake was six foot and a half. He was a big one. I 
have a barrel over there and the water comes out of a water fall 
and goes down 
in here. 
GH: What kind of frogs are these, just local? 
TB: Yeah, cow frogs we call 
'em. Actually, I think some call 
'em 
leopard frogs. Because they're spotted frogs. 
GH: Do you get them out in the woods or do you find them in a 
pond somewhere and bring them here? 
TB: Look at that grass, see 
'em down under the grass? You can see 
'em there. 
GH: I see them. So you pick 
'em up out in... 
TB: They come here themselves. 
GH: Oh, they migrate — when 
it rains or something. 
TB: No, they come here when the water warms up 
in the spring, 
they come here. Now underneath here, you see the plants, the 
leaves now they'll come up 
in the spring again and they'll grow. 
I got 'em 
in a plastic pot. Then I have — we can go around this 
way and I'll 
show you here — 
GH(aside) Those frogs look like a small 
(?) tree frog. 
TB• 
 Cut one over there. 
GH: So they're cutting the walnuts? 
TB: Yeah, they're takin' the walnuts. See here's another one, I 
got plants 
in that too, and I open up a valve down 
in 
the 
basement and this runs over and waters the flowers. The flowers 
are real pretty, but they're gone now. 
GH: Well, 
it's getting late 
in the season. When do you usually 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 58 
get your f 
i 
rst frost? 
TB: We usually get a frost in September. This year, no, we've got 
by. I picked up the walnuts this morning. These are the ones 
that's just fell off of that tree. The little girl I was tellin' 
you that died, her and her brother were playin' with the walnuts 
there, and after we 
lost her, the next year, that tree come up 
there, and I left it. Look where they're cuttin' 
'em — all 
over 
here. I put them in over there so that they wouldn't get 'em here 
and I picked up half a basket. 
GH: 
Is this walnut a wild tree? 
TB: No, these here are black walnuts. We had 'em over at the home. 
There's a whole row of 
'em here. They don't do nothin with 'em — I 
gather 'em and usually I have good ones. Last year they didn't dry 
and they weren't no good. They were all 
dried up when I — see I 
usually crack 
'em for her by the pint, see. And then she has 'em. 
Let's go get our soup. 
GH: Do you have some birds nesting in these boxes you got here? 
TB: Oh, I did have, yeah. You can see where the — see the nest 
sticking out?

Jim Stasz, Eugene Hunn 
2MIK: 
TX01: G-Audubon; 
GT. Jim's father originally from midwest, 
transferred out here post World War II 
to work for RCA. 
Jim 
born afterwards, 
in 1948, 
in this house, the 
local doctor was old 
fashioned, didn't believe 
in deliveries in hospitals. 
Town named 
after John James Audubon, who collected a Fork-tailed Flycatcher 
here, perhaps first or second record for North America of this 
South American bird. 
Jim's father saw another in NJ on Island 
Beach, originally misidentified as Scissor-tailed Flycatcher. 
His father was looking for something to get him away from his 
work. 
In 1950 started dabbling in plants; Jim has 3 older 
sisters, but none got into natural history. 
He went with his 
father somewhere within 100 miles of home nearly every weekend. 
Jim remembers birdwatching as early as 1957, but knows he was out 
in field before then. 
His father used binoculars, had his son 
use hand held 30x telescope; 
is odd 
in this regard among birders; 
has trained to 
look with just the one eye. 
Uses aluminum stock 
his father made. 
He and his father were less interested in 
chasing rare birds as 
in exploring area to see what was there and 
when. 
They also look at plants, fossils, rocks, everything; they 
kept very busy going on field trips with local organizations such 
as Torrey Botanical Club, Philadelphia Botanical Club, Delaware 
Valley Earth Sciences club looking 
in quarries. 
His father a 
member of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club, when an 
exclusive all 
male club; had higher standards then than now; 
needed three member references and had to be more than a casual 
feeder watcher. 
His father was accepted because he noted local 
distributions, etc. 
They used Peterson's guide and Pough's 
eastern field guide, still a favorite. 
Plant guide by Taylor, 
line drawings only and a small sampling of flora; thus more 
difficult than for birds; showed shapes of flowers and leaves. 
They probably made a lot of mistakes. 
Did little collecting, but 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 60 
might bring back some specimens in a bucket, sit on back porch 
and try to key them out 
in Gray's Manual. 
This a skill he has 
only recently developed. 
Boundaries of Pine Barrens: Difficult finding information on 
the Pine Barrens; Harshberger available, but no Wharton Tract 
bird or plant lists; not many people they knew were 
knowledgeable; nobody went there regularly birdwatching, as still 
today. 
They had impression it was "barren," name contributed to 
this impression. 
Birders haven't heard of 
its good spots, etc. 
But botanical people, however, nationwide, worldwide, have heard 
of the Pine Barrens and have a distinct impression of 
it. 
Not so 
for birdwatchers; those out of state likely have not heard of 
it. 
He tells people you can tell when you're in the Pine Barrens when 
you see pitch pines mixed with oaks; this eliminates contrasting 
roadside habitats. 
Turnpike habitats by accident of geography 
not of this sort. 
Virginia pine scrub of Delaware River, coastal 
plain zone; different geology, soils, plants, birds on inner 
coastal plain. 
Examples include jack-in-the-pulpit, spring 
beauty; a zone with a lush early spring flower display; swamp 
hardwoods such as walnut, hickory. Virginia pine belt separate 
but also of this zone; home to saw-whet owl. 
Pine barrens in 
spring nearly lacks flowers, such as a few windflowers (Anemone 
quinquefolia); shrubs of heather family flower later on, as 
blueberry/huckleberry complex. 
The heather family dominant in 
Pine Barrens in terms of extent of ground covered and diversity 
of species. 
If you spend lots of time outdoors you note that the 
Pine Barrens is colder in spring and warmer in fall that 
surrounding zones. 
Jim attributes this to effect of water 
holding 
in heat in fall but keeping soil, plants cold in spring. 
Extremes of temperature the same, but water table causes seasonal 
lag, 
in his opinion. 
Pine Barrens in 
late winter as cold as 
elsewhere. 
Lower growing species much effected, delayed in 
spring. 
March, April, early May Jim would concentrate on Inner 
Coastal Plain rather than Pine Barrens to see spring flowers; 
though the Pine Barrens does have a few early bloomers of special 
note such as the pixie moss, nice white mats in 
late April. 
For 
greatest diversity of flowers however in Pine Barrens go 
in July 
and August--when other areas are a bit past their prime. 
Other 
areas then peak again with goldenrods and asters in September and 
October. 
Seasonal patterns for birdwatching: Spring migration, don't 
go to Pine Barrens, go to Piedmont. 
For some reason birds favor 
the Piedmont all along the east coast in spring migration, rather 
than coastal plain. 
Why? 
Depends on how birds learn to migrate, 
a difficult question. 
May the best time for the Pine Barrens, 
all 
the 
local species have arrived, are singing, nest building; 
best time for sampling of all 
nesting species. 
Timing of return of breeders to Pine Barrens: Red-winged 
Blackbirds start singing around territory in early February; by 
late March females are 
in and nesting activity on; March Pine 
Warblers return. 
Pine Warblers are characteristic of any kind of 
pine stands, not just. the Pine Barrens. 
Then a flurry: 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 61 
Ovenbirds, black-and-whte warblers, blue-winged warblers, all 
nest in the Pine Barrens; these and rufous-sided towhee all 
are 
ground nesters, brown thrasher not ground nester, but low nester. 
Many of these are 
long distance migrants and now suffering 
reduced populations. 
They need extensive tracts of woods away 
from edges. 
Diversity of woods edge perhaps more apparent than 
real, because edges represent multiple habitats rather than one 
especially diverse habitat. 
Thus special value of place like the 
Pine Barrens. 
Full breeding complement of Pine Barrens birds in 
by mid-May, thus not delayed as 
in flowering of plants. 
This 
because nesting birds may feed in the warm canopy where trees 
flower early, eating insects there, etc. 
Birds and mosaic of habitats in Pine Barrens: 
One needs to 
examine all habitats to see them all. 
First, stream bottom 
habitats, with white cedar, chokeberry, serviceberry, etc. 
In 
spring you find wood thrushes, hooded warblers, prothonotary 
warblers; a good example is New Brooklyn Lake 
in Camden Co., 
in 
western extremity of Pine Barrens. 
Nice lake area in upper part 
of Egg Harbor river, coastal drainage. 
Good because its a patch 
of woods not logged for many years, few pines, many lowland 
hardwoods. 
Egg Harbor River one of major Pinelands rivers. 
Trees: Black gum with mistletoe, swamp white oak (ie., Quercus 
michauxii), swamp red maple. 
Discussion of ambiguity of common 
names. 
SIDE 2 
BIRDS associated with lowland hardwood forest: red-bellied 
woodpecker; we're near northern limit, has only recently invaded 
this area; some old hands here remember days when there were no 
red-bellied woodpeckers; likewise for red-headed woodpeckers, for 
which we are too far north and/or east for it to be common. 
Another similar southern species moving north recently 
is 
the 
mockingbird. 
Pine Barrens have a lots of hardwood swamp lands w/ 
black gum, sweet magnolia, tulip tree, particularly frequent in 
Pine Barrens, with Barred Owls and Pileated Woodpeckers, which 
latter still brings "oohs and aahs" from local birders. 
These 
two need large dead trees for nesting, thus more likely to be 
found 
in appropriate habitat in the Pine Barrens than in the 
surrounding area. 
Interesting transition in this region in 
lowland swamp vegetation from southern hardwood complex to swamps 
dominated by white cedar, a more boreal aspect. 
The ruffed 
grouse is common throughout pinelands; a northern species not 
found in pinelands at low elevations south of NJ. 
Ruffed grouse 
rarely found far from pine Barrens. 
Another northern nesting 
species that is common nester in Pine Barrens is brown creeper; 
seems to need trees with flaking bark, such as white cedar; 
typically expected in hemlock forest in mountains or 
in New 
England, or hickories in mountains. 
Another northern nester is 
the black-throated green warbler; normally of hemlock woods. 
New 
Jersey has a strange coastal subspecies, Wayne's BTG Warbler, 
found nesting in pine Barrens only about 1950; previously thought 
to be confined to cypress swamps 
in the Carolinas, etc. 
This 
subspecies isolated from bulk of BTG Warbler populations in 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 62 
mountains; distinguished in males by more extensive black bib. 
Few or none have gone into Pine Barrens to band local 
birds, 
so we don't really know where local bird populations (migratory) 
go 
in winter. 
Banders here few and far between. 
Another 
northern nester is the red crossbill, typically of Adirondacks 
and north. 
But they have nested 
in Pine Barrens after invasion 
winters; perhaps the birds thought the cedar swamps looked like 
home. 
Pine siskins, however, haven't made it this far. 
Southern species, of swamps: Prothonotary Warbler, Carolina 
Wren 
in southern swamp forests here, but not in white cedar bogs, 
no prothonotary warblers there. 
This contrast between southern 
southern hardwood swamp and white cedar swamp sharply defined 
here; sometimes within a few feet. 
Cedar shades out competitors 
if 
it gets started following disturbance; dense pure stands 
develope. 
In heat of summer it 
is comfortably cool under white 
cedar stands; no light enters. 
He and his father liked to go around and look at everything; 
had topographical maps; some recent, some from turn of the 
century. 
These old maps showed roads that were still there, 
though settlements often gone, 
leaving only a subtle contrast in 
vegetation, e.g., at Martha's Furnace. 
Suddenly it's all catalpa 
trees, you knew it wasn't the Pine Barrens anymore; grass ground 
cover rather than lichens, as 
in Pine Barrens proper. 
Such 
patches of disturbed ground too small however to support 
distinctive birds. 
But soils under old buildings enriched with 
lime from building materials to support Ebony's Spleenwort, a 
rare fern here, usually found 
in 
limestone areas of mountains 
(spores blown in). 
Go out in winter to find this evergreen fern 
as evidence of man's occupation. 
They'd explore to see what was there at a place with an 
interesting name on a map. 
Harrisville for example a good place 
for the spleenwort. 
This still a favorite place to take 
visitors; an artesian well with real, 
iron—tasting, potable 
water; an old ruin; very photogenic; native iron—stone walls; a 
paper mill where at one time they made a coarse paper from salt 
hay (Spartina); went out of business due to competition from more 
effective paper—making techniques. 
This the first gas—lit town 
in north America; used methane gas from swamp; piped through town 
to 
lights 
in 
locally made iron pipes. 
This town destroyed by 
1873 depression and subsequent fires. 
Jim recalls a large forest fire in the 1960's. 
Couldn't see 
it from Audubon as prevailing winds from the west. 
Birds 
attracted to post—fire zones include common nighthawk. 
They like 
barren ground with sky above; they would stay three to four years 
until habitat grows up. 
Fires might kill trees outright; 
leaving 
white skeletal snags attractive to cavity nesters, such as red— 
headed woodpeckers, great crested flycatchers, chickadees, 
titmice, bluebirds, especially bluebirds like combination of 
snags for nesting and open area. 
Few sparrows in the Pine 
Barrens. 
One 
is swamp sparrow: another disjunct distribution. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 63 
The swamp sparrows of Atlantic coastal marshes distinct from 
those of mountain bogs. 
New Jersey coastal swamp sparrows--on 
margins of Pine Barrens--have more in common with those of 
mountain bogs. 
Discussion of why few biologists study problems of bird 
distribution today. Jim describes himself as an old style 
naturalist. 
He's now writing up his thesis for Ph.D. at Johns 
Hopkins; has finished Masters. 
Studied evolution of snail diets 
in fossil record. 
Describes his training as very broad; strongly 
influenced by his boyhood experiences in the Pine Barrens. 
He 
always wanted to be 
in natural history but was discouraged from 
going into ornithology because "no money in 
it." So he went into 
Paleontology, though he was never primarily motivated by money 
considerations. 
Describes "paleo—ecology," his special 
interest. 
Need broad knowledge of history of 
life on earth. 
All 
this he 
learned about as a kid. 
He 
learned associations of plants and 
animals; could close his eyes and know the plants from listening 
to the bird songs.

Barrens habitat, because so much human disturbance, 
last century when population was much greater than 
of people who were disturbing the woodlands is one 
nge re. effects of fire suppression. 
I would prefer 
ocassette logs 
page 65 
to see more disturbance in the Pine Barrens: for example, the 
Pine Barrens gentian 
is now rare because there is 
less 
disturbance. 
Railroad rights of way were great places to 
look 
for rare plants in the past; not so much anymore. 
Rare plants 
particularly like treeless dry areas, damp meadows; you almost 
hope for something like a powerline right of way to break through 
the monotony of the forest. 
Pine Barrens in winter: Yes! 
To 
look for habitats then more 
readily seen, such as ponds. 
To note places to return later 
in 
the year. 
Easier to get through. 
Winter birds include influx of 
golden—crowned kinglets, red—breasted nuthatches. 
True, pure 
pine woods bird count tracts have lower diversity, but often have 
large numbers of birds that are scarce elsewhere. 
Indentifying 
plants in winter: can be done but often use a different set of 
characters, e.g., goldenrod gone to seed, look for shape of seed 
head. 
Rare Elliots Goldenrod; Jim has seen it 
in Maryland, not 
in New Jersey. 
Must key out to identify. 
In winter may find 
seed pods of rare plants such as orchids, old stalks and 
flowering heads distinctive, e.g., bog asphodel, gold crest, both 
distinctive as noted, both unusual species in unusual habitats; 
might indicate presence of other rarities in summer. 
Some bog 
areas have nothing unusual despite careful search. 
Summer and 
winter there are next to no waterfowl on Pine Barrens ponds; few 
fish for diving ducks and water too acid for plants that dabbling 
ducks like, e.g., widgeon grass. 
Occasional shorebirds may turn 
up, but only because they are flying over the barrens at 
daybreak, and see isolated pond or marshy area, then they'll 
land. 
Keeping of 
lists? 
He and his father were "too 
scientifically oriented." 
Only keep lists 
if data adequately 
scientific; casual observations led to appreciation of 
distributions of birds, such as abundance of Prothonotary 
Warbler, but he couldn't give precise numbers for it. 
Jim's 
father was an electronics engineer, specializing in antennas; he 
wrote a few minor papers, but helped build one of first field 
dish antennas for recording bird songs 
in the field, worked with 
George Renard, of Cornell project. 
His father knew the theory of 
sound recording; range of bird song frequencies; thus could 
choose proper microphone and dish size. 
Jim's father one of 
founders of Brigantine Christmas Bird Count. 
Pinelands CBC also 
central to pinelands, 
in fact circle entirely included within 
Pinelands boundaries. 
Ocean City/Brigantine CBC includes much of 
the coastal marsh habitats; Jim was on this one Saturday, Dec. 
17. 
Another count at Marmora, another at Elmer which include 
some of 
lands marginal to Pinelands. 
Jim and his father also 
would work on the Cape May CBC; 25 years ago were many fewer 
Christmas counts. 
Encounters with other field naturalists in Pine Barrens: 
Not other birders, but often botanists or reptile and amphibian 
searchers. 
Jim remembers listening at night for frog sounds, 
stopping to inspect every snake seen. 
You can go 
into the Pine 
Barrens for a weekend and never see or hear another person;

amazing given its proximity to big cities. 
Isolation. 
Generally 
they would stay on Wharton tract state lands, but often would be 
on private lands. 
Has done just a little canoeing. 
Canoe 
tourism is now a problem as anyone can now get a canoe. 
Trash 
levels orders of magnitude greater than before as a consequence. 
Every year there are articles in 
local newspapers about canoeing 
Pine Barrens rivers; has heard horror stories about trying to 
canoe these rivers. 
Now often will hear loud noise of 
canoeists; canoes banging, loud radios blasting. 
Also dirt 
bikes and off-the-road vehicles now tearing up the roads. 
They 
had an old Chevy station wagon; carried two jacks so 
if got stuck 
could jack up both ends and "leap frog" out of trouble by pushing 
car off jacks. 
Off road vehicle people 
in his view now 
intentionally destroy roads, tear up roads; now even difficult or 
impassable in four-wheel drive. 
Jim now prefers to go to Pine 
Barrens in mid week; somewhat less traffic. 
He has been known to 
confront people doing the wrong thing. 
Jim thinks local people 
have taken down old road signs indicating directions to 
discourage outsiders; slow them down; make 
it easier for them to 
get lost. 
Jim has topographical maps, memories of past trips, 
but 
it 
is still easy to get lost 
in there. 
Looking at his old 
turn of century map: Washington indicated with fields; now old 
foundations, grassy areas indicating old buildings. 
Such areas 
good for fence lizards/old foundations. 
Map originally surveyed 
1886. 
Shows places that haven't existed since 1900. 
Latest 
edition of topo maps show Quaker Bridge road as passable all 
the 
way through. 
Not sign present there now that bridge "unsafe to 
cross," but this not true; the bridge is safe, but the road has 
deep potholes, etc. 
Jim figures it 
is a tactic to discourage 
traffic. 
Opinions about Pine Barrens situation today: 
As a 
naturalist I know about the pinelands; as also people like Betty 
Woodford who gives courses. 
But information not readily 
available. 
Need a natural history of the pinelands. 
His father 
in 
1960's help establish a small group of serious amateurs and 
professionals to put together information: Pinelands 
Conservationists name of group: on the Pinelands. 
Dave Moore, on 
member, was a conservation lobbyist with the state. 
Ideas was to 
interact natural history people and politicians; concern then was 
the plan to build spaceport like jet airport, 20 mile long 
runway, support city of 120,000, for Philadelphia and New York. 
They looked at the Pines as a wasteland; we (Pinelands 
Conservationists) tried to counteract that. 
END SIDE 1. 
000 
How did this group develop: 
This group first advocated 
national scientific reserve idea for Wading River watershed and 
for Plains/pygmy forest. 
Q: Any plants peculiar to the Plains. 
A: Corema con radii Conrads G-BroomGT Crowberry, common species 
in 
Maine, Newfoundland, spotty to south, 
locally common 
in 
the 
Plains. 
Harshberger named the Plains the "Coremal," as a 
distinct forest type, recognized by International Botanical 
Congress; when met in New York they had a field trip to see 
it. 
Its a real strange experience to see it; 
good place for common 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 67 
nighthawks and grouse; acorns, bearberry Arctostaphylos fruits 
good for grouse, partridge berry, tea berry common there, also 
good grouse food. 
Breeding 
Bird 
Survey route: 
Did the route that went 
from 
Albion, near Berlin, through Berlin, Jackson Rd., through 
Clementon, up thru Tabernacle, then across toward Chatsworth. 
He 
and his father did 
it for 8 years, but may be defunct. 
Danny 
Bystrack of US Fish and Wildlife Service sometimes comes up to 
Pine Barrens to run routes. 
Few changes along this route, but 
built up somewhat along Jackson Rd. 
Used mimic thrushes 
(Mimidae) to 
indicate habitats; Mockingbirds at houses, Catbirds 
near streams, Brown Thrashers in uplands. 
Q: 
Other naturalist 
involved systematically in 
the Pine Barrens? A: Only botanists. 
Many plants are either unique to PB or would otherwise require 
long trips; e.g., for Corema, go to Maine, orchids, e.g., 
southern yellow orchid Habenaria integra must go to North 
Carolina, or the Utricularia olivacea greenish bladderwort, must 
go to Georgia; 
if you want to see Panicum hearstii Hearst's Panic 
Grass, you must go to one pond 
in the Pine Barrens, otherwise you 
don't see 
it. 
Other plants may be scarce but widespread in 
Northeast, but common in Pine Barrens, such as trailing arbutus, 
Hudsonia, yellow heather, Leiophyllum buxifolium, sand myrtle, 
if 
you 
lose the Pine Barrens you lose these species. 
Hundreds of 
people have a strong interest in these rare plants; botanists 
world wide will have heard about it; the Pine Barrens are sort of 
the Cape May or Hawk Mountains of the botanists. 
The Pine 
forests, of Loblolly, of the Atlantic coast south not distinctive 
to Jim, with exception of Pocossin area of South Carolina with 
Venus Flytraps perhaps botanically equivalent in 
interest to the 
Pine Barrens. Q: How to characterize this aspect of the value of 
the PB. 
A: Economic values being rapidly realized, e.g., 
starting with value of water resource recognized by Wharton, but 
must remain pollution free. 
A geologist friend notes that 
pollutants spilled on PB soil goes right to the water. 
In most 
of the Pinelands now 
if you're thirsty, just drink the water. 
Pinelands Conservationists established a self—guided nature trail 
at Bastso; also showed cultural features such as remains of 
charcoal furnace. 
This trail now gone, not maintained. 
Annie 
Carter is the naturalist down there; due to 
influence of 
Pinelands Conservation Committee, lobbying efforts of Dave Moore 
to get funds to turn old structure there into nature house, get 
materials for terrarium, get books. 
Died from lack of support. 
Pinelands Conservationists dying out; purpose fulfilled, but old 
time members dying out; Jim is the youngest. 
A small group with 
limited goals to begin the study to 
inspire Pinelands project. 
Jim and his father were the ornithologists; botanists; Ruth 
Patrick on diatoms; Robert Roberts from the academy did fresh 
water snails, his wife Marianne did lichens and bryophytes: 
specialists, professionals; Jim and his father the serious 
amateur ornithologists; along with Dave Fables, general 
naturalist, Lou Hand, botanist, Frank Hurt, Gil Cavalier. 
We 
were trying to distill what were the important areas, why certain 
areas of special scientific concern; had no hope of saving it 
all. 
Very satisfied with present outcome. 
But must always be 
Hunn--8S Audiocassette logs 
page 68 
able to explain why it's there; especially to the local people; 
it 
is a difficult concept. 
Most local people (in Camden area?) 
really don't know the Pinelands exists; only 
if there interests 
are 
involved, effected. 
Local naturalist society, the "Audubon 
Wildlife Society" (not connected with National Audubon), most of 
them would not know there was a Pinelands Commission or Preserve, 
same 
is true of most such groups 
in the area. 
Q: Pinelands commission role 
in 
interpretation, the PFP book 
plan: 
A: But you need more than a book. 
An interpretive center 
needed; Batsto the 
ideal 
location; capitol of the Pine Barrens; 
there is the iron furnace that made the Pine Barrens what is was; 
a glass factory; an active sawmill where state of NJ gets timbers 
for bridge construction, etc. 
A grist mill there. 
Lots of 
crafts people gather there in tourist season. 
A center of 
attraction already here. 
Should consolidate all 
expertise and 
efforts there. 
A place where people could get slide shows on 
various aspects: culture, history, plants, birds, animals, 
canoeing (but pick up your trash), shows there. 
Of course need 
money, an exhibition hall for displays perhaps. 
A self—guiding 
nature trail: yes, once set up really needs very little 
maintenance. 
His group did all the work, created brochures, 
etc., but no one else would accept responsibility for maintenance 
(plant), (animal)

(Timber rattler deadly, but only because) they would torment 
it, 
you know what I mean. (sound of his rattler rattling as 
it 
crawls around on his living room floor and he nudges at 
it with 
his boot; then he picks 
it up, still rattling, and carries it off 
down the hall!) "Rattle, come on!" We always picked them up, 
turned them loose, never killed them. 
They can give you a nasty 
bite. 
A man brought two from Florida, said they'd bite. 
I 
picked them up with no problem. 
They know you wont hurt them. 
Even this one 
if you pick up a stick he don't like 
it. 
Had a 
female, another one, he 
let her go back to her den. 
Won't keep a 
female again, they're scarce. Tell 
its a male by navel, female 
has shorter navel. 
024 
He (snake) goes all 
round house here, but usually keep him 
in 
big 55 gallon aquarium. 
People come to take pictures of him; 
state knows he has 
it, 
lets him keep it though it's against the 
law. 
Q: other animals. 
A: 
pigeons, 40-50 peacocks, chickens, 
goats, pigs, cows, but got rid of cows when cost of feed went too 
high; gets eggs from chickens, showed Hunn one oddly shaped, 
suggested it might have two yolks. 
(Screeches of "chalie" the 
(small) macaw. 
It can say a few words. 
Was getting 75-100 eggs 
out of his chickens. 
Parrot, he can say hello, goodbye, all 
that 
kind a stuff. 
I never bought him, but boy wanted him. 
Squirrels 
get on feeder, sometimes 25-30 at one time. 
Lots of birds come 
in: 
that's a titmouse and a chickadee; grosbeaks come 
in morning, 
just in winter; the Rose—breasted grosbeak comes 
in spring; blue 
jay and turtle doves here year round; squirrels don't bother us 
by eating too much; two babies fell out of nest, raised by hand, 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
9 
page 70 
got so tame would come into house and eat out of your hand; 
female electrocuted on wires, then male left; so Freeman has cut 
down the branch near the wires. 
Woodpeckers, don't pay too much 
attention to kinds, but that looks like the 
little downy 
woodpecker; get the big red—headed one, great big one, all 
blood 
red down on the neck, white wings, get 
in spring of the year. 
Cardinals come also. 
Feed them ground—up peanuts; jays feeding 
on fat; don't give 
it to them in summer, but in winter they need 
more fat. 
Mostly feed sunflower seeds. 
In winter no worms to 
feed on. 
They know when you feed 'em, they all 
come in. 
Boy at 
the (Methodist) camp, just 9 years old, 
like birds too, he says, 
"I wonder if I can get a bird feeder too," I says,"I'II make you 
one." 
Makes life interesting, just to set here and watch 'em, 
some days when it's raining. 
Nuthatches, two kinds here, Mr. 
Davis, the regular bird man called them that, thinks he moved to 
Arizona. 
Yea, a starling up 
in feeder with jays, have always 
been here. 
Big "crackles," big long—tailed blackbirds, then the 
red—winged blackbirds, the big brown thrasher, speckled all 
over 
(spring arrivals). 
Yeah, 
lots of big horned owls; Mr. White, 
owner of Whites bogs, called about it, 
thought it was shot. 
He 
went over brought it home called the state; they said bring it to 
the vet in Medford, but it ate good, seemed ok, veterinary turned 
it back loose again as 
it seemed ok. 
Born 
in Browns Mills 
in 
1923. 
I've worked in one place all 
my 
life. 
Quit school at 17, went to work at the hospital 
in New 
Lisbon, still there. 
His son works in Mt. Holly hospital. 
New 
Lisbon hospital by the stand pipe (?) at New Lisbon. 
Used to 
have 
lot of tubercular people, old people, some 95-100 years old, 
but now have some young people, 25 years old. 
Never picked pine 
cones, etc., never had to. 
I went there 
in 
1936-37 mowing grass 
in summertime, then 
in 1938 full time, been there ever since. 
Got close to 600 days sick time coming, and has 25 days vacation 
each year; takes a long vacation each winter as now. 
Robin (his 
son?) picked up deer, elk, moose, caribou horns plus plastic 
African antelope antlers. 
Bought the elk horns and skin off a 
girl 
at work. 
Squirrels: he 
likes them, never known them to get 
in the house, though 
some people say they don't like them because 
they get in the house. 
Grosbeaks arrived: called "Evening 
Grosbeak." 
He has a bird book. 
Sometimes there are so many 
grosbeaks you can't even see the ground; eat up a gallon of bird 
seed/sunflower seed 
in 20 minute. 
He buys sunflower seed by 50 
pound bag, costs $14, 
lasts about a week. 
Feeds summer and 
winter, squirrels in summer, 
less to birds 
in summer, they get 
enough bugs then. 
168 
Snakes: Corn, the hog—nosed, the coastal plain milk snake, 
looks like coral snake of florida, but not poisonous. 
Only 
poisonous ones here are copperhead up above Trenton and the 
rattler around here. 
They get under rocks. 
Had one 
in 
rock pile 
out near fish pond, but it went away. 
They den up under spring 
water, 40-50 in a den laying 
in where the water runs over them, 
to keep from freezin'. 
Where spring comes out of high bank. 
Rattlers eat rodents, rats; he had some rats around, the rattlers 
moved in and cleaned 'em out, same with owls, foxes; foxes catch 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 71 
weasels, etc., see remains at their dens, so they do more good 
than harm. 
People run the fox down, but they do a lot of good. 
Freeman used to run foxes, but didn't kill them. 
Used to have 
25-30 hounds. 
His brother Norman, keeps 20-25 deer-proof dogs, 
then breaks 2-3 puppies each year, but people got to setting 
steel traps, snares, snooses, so I just quit runnin' em 
altogether, cause you just loose a good dog, make you disgusted. 
Freeman's sister married a man named Meredith, he pays high as 3-
4000 dollars, as he's got all 
the money he needs, owns all 
the 
school buses; he don't care how much it costs, 
if 
he sees a good 
dog he'll buy 
it. 
He's got a big place down on the plains; spent 
$40,000 on the dog kennels, water faucets to drink from, etc. 
This man's father married Freeman's sister. 
220 
Freeman's father was George "Topsy" Taylor, also born 
in 
Brown Mills too, 
in a house; Freeman also born in house, mother 
never went to hospital; just 4-5 women come to the house to help 
with the birth. 
Freeman's father ran a sawmill,cut mostly cedar. 
Though never had no education he could tell just how many feet of 
lumber in a tree, he was smart that way. 
He died 
in 64, his 
mother died in 69, she was one of the Reeves', not related to the 
Whites. 
Bill Reeves the father, had a store, his mother used to 
run 
it, 
sold salt pork. 
Milton Reeves the son. 
Used to have 
barrels of salt pork, cent and a half a pound; barrels of beans. 
Cant buy salt pork anymore. 
Got fat for birds from work, from 
scrap off beef, etc. 
Doesn't trap or hunt, just a few 
cottontail. 
There's the female grosbeak, see she doesn't have 
the yellow. 
265 
Other animals around here: mink, weasel; mink live 
in cedar 
swamps, quite a few of them; beaver, lots now, make their own 
dams; beavers lot thicker now than when he was a kid. 
Around 
1930-1940 state game released them; they'd been nearly trapped 
out. 
Now there's a season on em. 
Deer got very scarce, lucky to 
seen one or two from here to Pasadena, where used to see a 
hundred. 
See lots of tracks, but lucky to see one deer a year 
around here. 
Paper claims they kill more each year, but he 
doesn't know who. 
His father told him he used to see black bear 
here when he was a kid. Deer hunting clubs sure don't kill them. 
They used to kill 20-25 deer in one drive; this past 5th of 
December they had their drive--at the gun club up toward 4-mile 
circle--about 20 "drivers" and 20 "standers." 
Killed one deer. 
Mostly from Trenton; 40 hunters. 
Used to be hundreds of hunters; 
one behind every tree. 
Very few now; they must know there's no 
deer around. 
Now have a doe day, a muzzle-loader season, 5 day 
of regular deer season, the bow-and-arrow for buck or doe. 
Freeman thinks deer have all 
gone to North Jersey where never 
used to have deer; but all 
land up there posted; have to pay 
$1000 for a week's hunting up there. 
Most of the farmers charge 
that. 
"I wouldn't give 'em $10 for all 
them deer, didn't care for 
the meat." 
Likes fried rabbit though. 
Jackin' goes on, you hear em 
shooting at night. 
Mostly people from President Lakes, new 
development since 1965-1966; mostly military from Ft. Dix. 
These 
people just want the horns, 
leave the carcass; don't discriminate 
between does and bucks, even button bucks, which would be 
legal 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 72 
buck for following year. 
Biggest ever, one killed 
in 1945 with 
31 points, 3 and 1/2 yrs old. 
Horns don't mean nothing. (showed 
me picture later) 
Red and gray fox both. 
Illegal trapping in 
Burlington co., can trap 
in Ocean Co.; traps with no name he just 
tears up and throws away. 
Steel traps, sometimes don't tend to 
them for 3-4 days; had a dog caught for 6 days. 
Must check them 
every day. 
Wild Plants: 
his sister knows all 
of them. 
Ada McCort, 
lives down 
in Birmingham. 
How learned: just went around in 
springs. 
A plant grew down 
in cranberry bogs, a little curling 
fern, good cooked 
in goose grease and put on burns. 
One time his 
brother's little boy badly burned. 
People in hospital couldn't 
help; every time removed bandages he started bleeding, needed 
transfusion. 
She knows all 
the plants. 
Freeman's phone number: 
$93-6454. 
Doesn't know his sisters phone number. 
She used to 
bring a lot of wild plants in here.

accept it, I said. Oh boy, he (unintelligible) over an artificial 
tree. I always have, he always went and bought a pine, or knotty 
pine. Cut his own, or cedar. Every year all 
the little girls 
would say, I can't get the bulbs on the tree. The they got 10 on, 
probably, cause there was no branches. Only the pine. I mean no, 
you know, 
it was hard to trim. 
GH: So when will you set your traps in the Forman City area? 
TB: That'd be the first. I got baskets of traps all 
ready to go. 
I'd say with this here law goin' through, this'll bout be 
it. 
DM: Pending — you think the law's gonna go through? 
TB: I think it'll 
go through because, I tell you, I been to 
Trenton so finally I just called it off. I said, 
look, I go up 
there, I get upset and at 70, goin' 
on 74, I just can't stand that 
upsetness. And when you see how crook the deal 
is, 
like Carser. 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 75 
Carser's from Searsdale, I think. When it couldn't get the vote, 
now 16 people had walked out on that. He went around, on the 
floor, and the trappers saw him push buttons of people wasn't 
there. And that's how.... 
it really is, 
it's 
GH: Carser, he's a legislator? 
TB: Mmhm. Riccio, he told Senator Zanes. Zanes, he was fightin' to 
keep 
it 
in his committee. Riccio, he was president of the Senate 
and he didn't have to send it to any committee before he brought 
it before the Senate. Actually, the trappers — it was really 
their own fault in a way, because they took and, they conceded a 
defeat by a set — a rubber—jawed trap that Woodstream brought 
out. And that Woodstream Corporation, they should never, never 
brought it out. Because this here head of the humane society, 
Austinberg, she had already said that it 
looks like the bill was 
defeated and it's too bad because they'd had a victory so close, 
in Zanes' committee. So we had a meeting and I think I was the 
only one that was against acceptin' this here rubber—jawed trap. I 
said, no way, I said, that's conceding that we are defeated. And 
they took it to Zanes and Zanes brought it up right away, a week 
later they put another number to the bill and shoved it through 
and they passed it. 21 to 9. 
GH: Where was this, 
in committee? 
TB: This was right in the Senate. 
GH: Does it have to go to 
TB: Now it goes to Assembly, but the Assembly gave us such a 
lacin' before, I can't see any way that we can beat it. Unless 
it's honest. If 
it's honest, we might make it. 
MB: And there's so many trappers depending on 
it. The families, 
large numbers 
GH: 
It's just a lot of misunderstanding. 
DM: I think a lot of 
it's misunderstanding. 
TB: Well, 
it's a emotional 
issue, that's the whole thing. 
Actually, I'll 
go along, but a slaughterhouse is cruel too. 
GH: All 
these people that are against it probably eat hamburger 
every day. 
MB: Wish they would go there and see. 
GH: So what's this rubber—jawed trap supposed to do? 
TB: The rubber—jawed trap 
is supposed to hold the animal and not 
be as cruel 
in cutting in, 
like the... 
GH: Do you have one of those traps you could snap on his hand, 
just to show him? 
TB: Yeah, I had 
'em back there 
in the. 
DM: A rubber one? 
TB: No, a steel one. 
DM: Oh, I thought maybe you had one already. 
GH: No, he was demonstrating that the steel trap doesn't exert 
that much force. 
TB: I have 'em back there 
in the cabin. I built a fire back there 
this mornin'. So I have the — what little fur, boy I'll 
tell 
you, 
skimpy this year. Them hooks oughta be full of furs by now. 
GH: Are you working on cleaning any animals out there now? 
TB: No, not now. But if 
it dries off a little bit, then we can go 
down to the creek, and I can show you where I used to catch a lot 
of mink. No more. 
MB: Will you come back tomorrow. 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 76 
GH: 
I'm going to be 
in Seattle tomorrow. I know, I come 
in for a 
week, and then I'm gone. But I'll 
be back in March — of course, 
the season will 
be past. What do you do 
in March? 
TB: March, what date will you be back 
in March? 
GH: Oh, about the 20th. 
TB: Probably too late because the 15th it's over. 
DM: 
I'll 
be back. I'd like to make an appointment to come down 
and see you. You said the season opens January 1st. Maybe I'll 
come back — the 2nd would be a Monday. Maybe that Monday. 
Who do you sell your furs to? 
TB: I sell, usually I sold to Dick Rule, but when Dick Rule voted 
for that rubber—jawed trap and I thought it was a mistake, I told 
him right then and there, no more furs, Dick. No trouble gettin 
rid of your furs. 
DM: I knew there were a couple people around, I just wondered if 
it was... 
TB: Tom Zander, he's a big buyer. Tom's a good guy. 
MB: Why he's been after his furs for years. He does take care of 
em. Beautiful. 
DM: What do they make of the muskrat fur? Coats? 
TB: Mmhm, all 
coats. You don't have Joe's address, do you? 
DM: He still 
in the hospital? 
GH: Last I heard. 
DM: Did he have a kidney infection or something? 
GH: I guess it's been kind of a chronic problem. 
TB: He told us his kidneys were bad. 
DM: He a young guy? 
GH: Mmhm. 
TB: 39. 
MB: He told us that his kidneys were like that, about three times 
as big as they should be or somethin'. That's bad. 
GH: I didn't know how serious this bout was. 
MB: He doesn't have cancer. 
TB: No. 
GH: I don't think so, nobody said anything about it. 
MB: Gee, such a nice fella. You know, very friendly and... 
TB: You have children? 
GH: Yeah, two girls. 
TB: How old? 
GH: 9 and 11. They expect me back for Christmas. 
MB: 
I've liked everyone that's come here. 
GH: Well, we certainly enjoyed your hospitality. Wish things were 
going better. 
TB: Well, the thing of 
it 
is, 
now, I don't really have to have 
it, which 
is a break for me. But years ago 
if 
it was this way, 
why then it would of really been bad. But then years ago you had 
no competition. None at all. 
GH: Still, 
it means a lot to you, 
it's not just money. 
TB: Well, I 'II 
tell 
you what it means to me now, 
is what the 
money can do for the grandchildren and the great—grandchildren. I 
got three 
in college, see. That's the thing now, what the money 
could do for them. I gave — I think I told you before when you 
were here, I gave my grandson, I gave him 120 dollars from some 
traps I set for him. Then I give him 500 more. I said, 
look boy, 
this 
is not towards your education. I said, when you build your 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 77 
first house, this 
is to buy your front doorknob with, cause 
that's about all 
it'll 
be worth then. 
DM: Hopefully not. 
GH: So right now how many traps do you have set? 
TB: Practically nothin'. Because I have pulled up, I got baskets 
of traps out there, but... Like I said, the first day I caught 
three, one coon, couple possums, and I only had — Joe was with me 
— I only had about a dozen traps out. So 
it was really doin' good. 
GH: When was that? 
TB: That was the 15th. Joe was with me when I set. And then he 
couldn't be with me when 
GH: of November? 
TB: 
15th of November, yeah. So Joe couldn't be with me. So the 
first day I picked up three fox. Out of the first nine traps. One 
fox and two traps was gone, that fast — and I'm there at 
daylight. But he couldn't be with me, and to and behold the next 
day, they hit me again. This time they left the trap and took the 
fox. Red fox. And all I got that day was two possum. And that's 
about the way things has run. I got a few coon after that. 
GH: How far from your house 
is your set? 
TB: I would say, three quarter of a mile. All 
the way round the 
area. 
GH: 
Is 
it your own land? 
TB: This here's on Atlantic City Electric. Most of this — it 
wasn't posted at the time I started trappin' 
it. But then they 
posted it the day before deer season. Two days before deer 
season. But you do see a lot of deer. Out back. 
MB: But they all hid at season. My daughter couldn't get over it. 
She says, mother, you can see their tracks all over. I said, 
if 
they weren't all over deer season, they couldn't even find... 
DM: Well they know when it's deer season. Those people are out 
with bows and arrows or whatever kind of 
TB: I can't say.. 
DM: Muzzleloaders. They're not even a threat I don't think. But 
the hordes — but it's not like the hordes that descend over that 
one week. 
MB: They know, they know. 
TB: I had to 
laugh the first day of the season, I's back there 
along the railroad and I couldn't get to where I wanted to go. 
And the grandson didn't fly 
in from college till — what the 8th, 
mom? 7th or 8th. The 8th he come in, cause 9th and 10th he was 
here. So one guy was ahead of me, on the railroad back there, 
where I wanted to get. I got back there I guess about a quarter 
of 7. So I guess about quarter after 7 I seen him light up a 
cigarette — it was still not light enough really to see. So then 
they disappeared. Well that made me uneasy cause I didn't want to 
move down there where they were because they could of stepped in 
the edge of the woods, took a stand. At five after eight I looked 
down there and ,like I tell 
the grandson, it's not what you get, 
it's what you see or what you miss that's the fun part — and 
to 
and behold, out steps a big doe. And she looked up and down the 
railroad, looked up towards me, she looked back and I said well, 
they're comin' out now — 210 yards away, too far. So out come 
these two big rackers, rack bucks, and they walked across, then 
two more does. They headed on down the swamp, they staid there 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 78 
till season was over 
After the season's over, then they moved 
back 
in again. 
DM: I believe it. 
MB: Oh yeah, my daughter saw it. They seen 'em, they saw 7 and 8 
out there right away after the season was over. 
DM: 
It's an annual ritual just like mating season. 
MB: She says mother, I can see my deer. 
TB: I kid my grandsons, 
like I told 'em both, I said, 
it's not 
what you get that you have the fun over, 
it's the ones that are 
missed. The ones that are killed, that's it, but the ones that 
are missed, that's the ones you really had the fun over 'em. I was 
with my grandson when — well, both of 
'em — when they killed their 
first rabbit. But Bucky, when he got his first trout I was with 
him, when he got his first rabbit, when he got his first deer. So 
I told him week after he got his grouse — I was tendin' traps out 
at Colman — so I said Buck, there's a another grouse out there, I 
said, you go with me Saturday morning, you'll be out of school, 
you'll get a crack at it. So we walked down the road and 
to and 
behold the grouse kicks up. 
It went so fast he didn't even get a 
shot at 
it. I said well, you got another chance Buck. So we 
walked around the road and sure enough, we got up 
in a clearin', 
he missed him clean. So I said, one more time Buck. So we go 
around and we get him in another open spot and he missed him 
again. I said Buck, did you hear what that grouse said? When he 
took off? He said no, but I'm gonna hear it. I said, well I heard 
what it said. 
It said, Bucky, you mighta killed my mate before, 
but you couldn't hit my rear end with a barn door. 
DM: And that's the one they remember. 
TB: Mmhm. That's the one they get kidded about. 
GH: Do you eat grouse? 
TB: Oh, yeah, they're good. Mmhm. 
MB: I love pheasant. 
GH: You have to pull 
all 
the feathers and everything? 
MB: I don't do 
it, 
he does it. Remember, I'm a city gal. 
DM: That sounds like goin' to work to me, pullin' the feathers and 
cleanin' 
'em. 
TB: Well, I'll 
tell 
you, a lot of times we'll just skin 'em. Takes 
the feathers and all 
right off 
MB: 
...right away, 
if he wants to do that, 
I'll take care of the 
house. I'll do the cooking, I'll 
raise the children, but please 
don't expect me to skin out the furs 
TB: See, we travel to different conventions. 
MB: because I do not intend to do 
it. And they open their mouths, 
like this, did you say that? I set him straight, yes. 
TB: This trapper walked up to her. And I knew Jimmy, he's Tom 
Lander's partner there 
in Kentucky you know, 
in Elizabethtown, 
Kentucky. He walked up to Muriel and he said, where've you been 
all 
my life? He's a married man, you know, kiddin'. So he was 
talking, you know, he goes on over to one of the women standin' 
there, he said, you know, the Lord only made one thing better 
than a nice bunch of beautiful women. They said well what's that 
Jimmy? And he said, me. 
MB: And he's an ugly little fella. 
TB: When he comes 
in with his furs, he said when he comes 
in his 
wife puts his slippers and pipe out there, said he drops the furs 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 79 
off 
in the shed and when he gets up 
in the morning they're all 
skinned and stretched. She does it. We have a young woman comes 
here and does the same thing, she started this year. Skinning the 
catch, yeah. That's the young fellow that I taught to trap. 
GH: Just for practice? 
TB: No, no, she's gonna do it — and now she wants to tan furs. I 
gave her books on tannin. 
MB: Now she's a pioneer woman. 
GH: Make all 
her own clothes. 
TB: Yeah, they will. 
MB: 
It's wonderful. 
GH: 
Isn't that tanning kind of a smelly business? 
TB: No, not too much. No, you would use crocks, stuff like that. 
You wouldn't wanta use metal. It'd have to be stoneware, crocks 
and stuff like that to put 'em 
in. 
'GH: What do you soak 'em in? 
TB: Well, there's a different solution, 
like acid and alum, salt, 
all 
different things mixed together. 
GH: So you buy these materials? 
TB: Yeah 
GH: Regular store? 
TB: No, most of that you would have to get from a supplier. 
GH: So when you set your traps, how do you decide where to put 
'em? 
TB: I think that'd be more or 
less — that would be 
instinct. You 
just seem to know where 
to trap. Now I know down here, most 
trappers will come 
in, would never trap where I been catchin' 
rats. Muskrat. Because the only sign there now and then there's 
stool, droppings. And that's where I been catchin' 
'em. 
GH: So the rat droppings look different from any other kind? 
TB: Yeah, they are usually just about like a regular rat, you 
know, would have 'em around the stable or something 
GH: Bigger? 
TB: Yes, a little bit, and then you can tell they're black you 
know. And damp. 
GH: So they come up these little creeks too? 
TB: They come up on 
logs and stuff, on hommocks and different 
things like that. And then as I go along I'll 
take and feel with 
my boot for holes 
in the bank. And that's where the — they're 
bank rats mostly, no house rats. When I say house rats I don't 
mean your dwellings. Down on the state meadow, that's really the 
place to see, that's where they... 
GH: What's the season down on state land? January 1st till 
how 
long? 
TB: Till March the 15th. We usually pull out before. 
DM: Pretty much done 
in, huh? 
TB: well, the reason we pull out mostly 
is because of cuts — the 
rats start matin', and when they start matin' the males are 
fighting and they get out up — oh, they get cut up bad. 
GH: When do they start mating? 
TB: Well, I would say, around the end of February. If 
it's warm. 
It might, you know, go a little longer. 
GH: Now with this last cold spell, how did that affect your 
trapping? 
TB: Well, I lost a fox yesterday, from bein' — the ground was 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 80 
froze. The trap comes up through the ground too slow. When that 
trap starts up and he feels it, he's gone. 
GH: So he got away. 
TB: Yeah. Fact it's - trappin' as I have known it 
is just about a 
thing of the past. Now we have Howard Tomlin, he's a young man, 
but he covers a lot of ground and he's usin' a lot of traps. And 
as of 
last week, he had 48, which 
is nice trappin'. Right now I 
have about - just around here - 8 or 10 fox, maybe 12 or 15 
raccoon. 
GH: Have you been catching any raccoons? 
TB: Very few, very few. 
GH: They can get to be a real 
pest, 
like 
in downtown Seattle. 
TB: Oh, right over here in Pennsylvania, they're tearin' the slate 
roof off, over here at Windmore, outside of Philly. They had 
it 
on Channel 
10 here, the other week. They're tearin' the slate 
roofs off. 
GH: 
In the middle of the city, too, right? 
TB: You can't tell these here antis that, they don't wanta hear 
i 
t. 
DM: They're talkin' about rabies here, the spread of diseases. 
TB: 
In Maryland I think, there's 478 cases and 278 are raccoons. 
GH: Do you worry about rabies? 
TB: Well, I'll tell 
you, I worry about it this way. Not myself. 
But I won't let the grandchildren or great-grandchildren touch 'em. 
I keep 'em away from them. 
GH: Have you caught rabid animals in your traps? 
TB: One. I didn't catch 
it 
in a trap - it died out here 
in my 
tractor shed. I shoulda called the state and let 
'em take 
it but 
instead of that I just dug a deep hole and picked it up on a 
pitchfork and carried it over and buried it, 
got rid of 
it. I 
warn the youngsters when I talk in the schools or like last week, 
last Wednesday I went in to the church and they had what they 
call 
the Royal Rangers like boy scouts, and I told them that when 
a animal 
is friendly, keep away from it. I had a friend, out 
spottin' deer one night, and this fox come right up to the car, 
and kept goin' 
round the car. And he said if 
he had a gun, he 
woulda killed it. Course 
if he'd had a gun and got caught it 
woulda been bad too. With the warden. But that's the uh - I don't 
worry too much, I try, 
I've tried skinning with the rubber gloves 
on, 
but 
GH: Can you actually tell from looking at animal 
if 
it has 
rabies? 
TB: No. No, 
it'd be hard to tell. 
GH: Wouldn't it have to bite you? 
TB: Not necessarily. You can get it just from handlin' 
'em. You 
take most the time, people come in contact with the animal - I 
think 
if 
they take our steel traps away from me, you're gonna see 
a increase. And you can't tell 
'em, they said there's no such a 
thing - they won't even believe this here from Georgia, where it 
comes from the health center there 
in Georgia, they won't even 
believe it, the antis won't. They just say there's nothin' 
to 
it, 
it's propaganda, and I just wisht it was. But the one thing I 
don't like, 
is bats. Because they really carry it. And I do 
remember one time 
in Virginia we were down visitin' our son-in-
law's people, we were all settin out there just the evening, and 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 81 
lot of times if they're caught up on the crops, they follow the 
shade, they just move around the tree. We're sittin' there and you 
know this bat comes across the ground. And it's asquealin' and 
comin' right towards us. And not in the air — on the ground. I 
figured it had to be sick. So I've wore boots all my 
life, cowboy 
boots or engineer boots, rubber boots when I'm trappin', but I've 
wore boots. And I just walked over and put my heel 
on him. And 
then they buried it. But I didn't like the looks of 
it, 
the way 
it was — it was just a steady makin' that noise as 
it come 
DM: 
In the middle of the day? 
TB: No, this was in the evening. 
GH: Doesn't sound right. 
TB: No. When the state opens, why the second day of the season 
would be — and that's not bad, when the tide's out that's not bad 
walkin' along 
if you got hip boots on. 
DM: Well that sounds good, I'd 
love to come down. What time would 
you go out? You'd go out. 
TB: Well, you have to go accordin' to tide. It could be 
in the 
afternoon. So you don't know. I'd have to check with the tide and 
get word to you. 
DM: Well, I'll 
be talkin' to you. 
I'll 
get your phone number and 
check with you maybe New Year's Day or before that even. 
GH: So you have kids coming along stealing from your traps — your 
traps are pretty close to the road then? 
TB: Yeah, when you set traps for fox, 
lotta times on old roads, 
that are not traveled, you set right in the center of the road. 
Where there's just like a path where the ( ) of the road's growed 
up, 
see. And that's where they hit me this year on the first day. 
Then the next day, I found the box that their spotlight come 
in, 
layin' right in the road. They'd took the light out and plugged it 
in, 
it was 300,000 candlepower. You know that's a powerful 
light. 
GH: Got one of those lights myself, but I use 
it for looking for 
owls and stuff. 
TB: Oh. Yeah, we got a pair of 
'em here. Man, I love to hear 'em. 
One'll get 
in 
the hedgerow here and he'll sound off, the mate'll 
sound off back here you know. Yeah, I really.. 
GH: What's 
it sound like, can you imitate it? 
TB: No, I couldn't, no. 
I'll 
tell 
you one thing, twice in my 
life, once it was 
in the evening and I had a Woolrich outfit on, 
with boots, and I had my trap up here 
in the stream. That's open 
territory up there yet. 
It's such treacherous walking. And I 
don't bother with 
it no more. One time 
it wasn't so bad, but then 
instead of having the old bridge there, you could trap even 
underneath it and just about 20 feet from it I caught four mink 
in four days. 
GH: There still mink around here? 
TB: A few. 
If I see a mink trap, I won't set. And another thing, 
I won't set my fields no more for fox here. 
I've caught two fox 
in one morning on this side. Because if I set, I'm gonna catch 
the little stinkers. And I like to see 
'em around. Some people 
hate 'em, but we have 'em around here and I like to see 
'em, they 
keep moles down and stuff like that. 
GH: Probably don't like to see 
'em 
in your traps though. 
TB: I don't wanta see 'em 
in my traps, no. I release 'em if 
possible in the traps. But I did have to kill 
one this year, and 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 82 
I hated to do 
it because they' 
and I had no way of gettin' 
'e 
shoot it. And I don't like to 
possum off and then kill 
'em, 
can't see catchin' anything an 
right into the antis' hands be 
they call trash animals. To me 
you take fox, coon, muskrat, s

TB: 
...course they was bringin' you know anywhere from three and a 
half to five dollars. That five dollars would feed you for a 
week. I was really trappin', just for skunk. I set for skunk. 
DM: Time's change. 
TB: Yeah, they change. Well, the fox was worthless then, the 
skunk was 
in. I caught fox just for the bounty. And I tried to 
tell my cousin the other night it was three and a half dollars, 
he says no, three. Well, he gets somethin' 
in his head, 
it's 
impossible to change him. I said, Everett, you pay the JP fifty 
cents, you got three dollars, but it's still three and a half 
bounty, because you paid him and you got three and a half back. 
GH: What's the JP? 
TB: That's the magistrate. Justice of the Peace. 
GH: 
Is that like a bribe? 
TB: No, no, you paid him to make out the papers. And then what he 
would do, he'd take a punch, and he'd punch right inside the ear 
so that if you took 
it somewhere else and they looked, they'd 
know — because a lot of times they were collectin', sometimes, 
three times on the same one. 
GH: So you could keep the skin and use 
it? 
TB: Yeah. But, there wasn't no sale. 
GH: Why did they have a bounty on the fox? 
TB: Well, for — they were getting the game birds, 
like the 
re practically worthless any more, 
m out of there, so I did have to 
— lot of 
'em set traps and catch the 
and throw 'em away. I can't see it. I 
d throw it away. Then you're playin' 
cause then you're throwin' away what 
no animal 
is trash. Because, 
if 
kunk, weasel, mink — they're all 
have a value. 
ossums? 
rim. Possum is beautiful fur. And 
that only leaves two, that's 
ame animals. There's your story. I 
agazine and — this actress Loretta 
t took I think a hundred and some 
methin' 
like that, which is 
shorty coat — and she said that in 
ed and forty some trash animals 
and wanted to know what a trash 
d now for sixty two years and I 
named the different animals, I 
d, 
that leaves squirrel and rabbit.

we'll turn it over to the editor 
ger want your magazine anyhow, 
if 
to write articles like that. So I

pheasant, quail and rabbits and stuff like that. I always said 
that the fox was blamed more than he was really doin' 
it to the 
game. Because usually if you follow a grey fox, you'll see where 
he's caught mice, moles and stuff like that. And then they like 
fruit. They like the chicken grapes, and the fox grapes and all 
this — and persimmons and different things like that. Yeah. But 
the red fox I think would get more rats and rabbits and stuff 
like that. 
GH: Do red fox take more prey than the grey — is 
it more powerful 
or bigger than the grey? 
TB: Not too much bigger, but they are really — I can't say 
they're different species hardly, but a grey fox 
is more like the 
cat, and the red 
is more like the dog. Their foot is bigger, 
their foot is the size of a rabbit hound, practically. And the 
grey fox can climb a tree, the red can't. They can really go up a 
tree. 
GH: Their track 
is supposed to be... 
TB: Their track 
is different. The track of a grey 
is just about a 
little larger than a cat. And the red fox is 
like a dog. 
GH: Same shape? 
TB: Well, not altogether. The red'll show more of the nail than 
the grey fox. I got somethin' I want to show you. 
GH: What was the story about this red wolf again, where was that? 
TB: Down below here. 
GH: Where could 
it have come from? 
TB: 
It's — well, actually, what it 
is, 
it's on a sod part, and 
they're tryin to keep it quiet for some reason. But the women, 
that he hired 
in the summer to mow the sod, they were scared to 
go down there, because three of 'em come out and practically 
challenged the girl 
on the tractor, you know. So they wouldn't go 
down there. So then the men went down there, and they saw this 
doe and fawn come out of the woods. And when they come out of the 
woods, two of 
'em was right behind it. The third one was in the 
edge of the — well 
it's where it's been bulldozed, see. The doe 
tried to get back, that one had it. Killed it right there 
in 
front of the guy's eyes. And they started tearin' 
it up. So 
anyhow, this deer season, they skinned out their deer, they had 
22 deer. And when they skinned 'em out they took all — they just 
cut the antlers off, the heads is there, and they don't save the 
hides which is tremendous waste. Cause they can get five to seven 
dollars for the hides if they take it to a buyer. So they took 'em 
all 
down along there where they seen 'em and they dumped 'em, and 
then they set a number four trap there. Well 
last Wednesday I 
think 
it was, a week yesterday, they caught one of 
'em. And they 
claim it's a pup, 
it's not the bigger one. And it weighs 44 
pounds. 
DM: And they've still got it alive someplace? 
TB: No, no, they killed. They were afraid to go near. 
GH: Have you seen the skin? 
TB: 
I've .seen a picture of it. And I looked at the picture and, 
course bein' out west at the conventions and all 
and seein' the 
pictures of coyote, 
it don't look altogether like a coyote, and 
the that's awful heavy for coyote — and they say it's a pup, 
it's 
not one of the old ones. 
GH: Couldn't be a wild dog? 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 84 
TB: Oh no, 
no way 
is 
it a dog. We all 
have had plenty of 
experience with animals. I say no... 
GH: Well you know, coyotes come right into Seattle. I saw one 
down on the railroad tracks 
in the industrial area just south of 
town. You can always tell they're not a dog, partly cause they 
have a white eye. Wolf has a white eye too. 
TB: You have any idea what they weigh? Top weight? 
GH: No, but I've got a book out in the car — mammals, we could 
look 
it up. 
TB: Well, that's the thing. This friend of mine, I know 
definitely that his was a coyote — he caught that out here in 
Bevy, but that there weighed 32 pounds. Any animal weighs 44 
pound, that sounds too heavy for — and to pull a deer down like 
that with no problem, 
it sounds more like wolf. And when she 
asked the guy out there, she said oh, what a large red fox, 
it 
was — red fox, 
lady, he said, that's a red wolf. 
DM: That's pretty unique for around here — specially three of 
them. 
Anon: Seven — there may be more, specially if that was a pup. 
TB: I don't know, I just rigged a couple traps. This boy, he's 
got permission to set in there — well he's a young man, he's been 
married since he was 16. And his wife was here day before 
yesterday. They really made a success. They had three youngsters, 
and he just built three more rooms, he already had a three 
bedroom ranch there, and he built three more rooms on 
it, 
and he 
really is a go—getter. I taught him to trap last year, and he 
caught 21. This year he's got 16 already, but he's been so busy 
workin' on his house that he hasn't had time. He's quite a guy. 
DM: How big is a number four trap? 
TB: A number four is really plenty big. 
DM: 44 pounds, that's a lot of fight. 
TB: You better believe it — and they had 
it on a drag, they had 
it on a chunk of wood so 
it drug 
it — oh I tell you, according to 
what they said they followed it, 
it drug it about a quarter mile. 
Before they caught up to 
it. 
DM: That's a determined animal. 
GH: This book's got a lot of 
information in 
it. Red wolf there, 
and grey wolf. They got real 
long, skinny legs. 
TB: This here, I'd 
like for you to've seen the picture of 
it, 
because to me 
it looked more like a red wolf than 
it did coyote. 
I've seen so many, even on the slide, the coyotes 
in a trap, and 
most the coyotes I've seen had so much grey 
in 
'em — and this was 
red, this was definitely — and this had that, 
in the tip of the 
tail, 
it had white. 
GH: Well 
it says here the coyote weighs 20 to 50 pounds, the red 
wolf 40 to 70 pounds. So 
if 
it was a coyote, 
it was an awfully 
big one. 
TB: Well, they claimed it was a pup, so that'd be 
in the — they 
said the others are the parents of 
'em, were much larger. This 
guy, right there, they didn't pay no attention to him. 
GH: Do you get any of these black or ( 
) fox around here? 
TB: No. 
I've only seen one, I've seen one 
in my lifetime and that 
was back 
in the 60s and I was ridin' down the road with a friend 
of mine, Morris Pankis, he passed away 
in 
'69. He said oh, 
look 
at that big cat goin' across the road. I said, Morris, that's no 
Hunn--$3 Audiocassette logs 
page 85 
cat. We got up there, and here 
it was turned around lookin' at us. 
It had one foot up 
in the air. I said Morris, silver fox. And he 
admitted it was a fox. He was some guy. Last time I saw him in 
the hospital, him and I both knew, we'd been together, he was 
like a father to me, he was twenty years older. That'd make him 
93 now. I think he knew and I knew that was 
it, when we shook 
hands and I left the hospital. And I think the next day he was 
gone. But at 76 years old you couldn't keep up with him. Man, he 
was gone. You'd hear the dogs a—running and first thing you'd 
know, you'd head up on the dogs and Morris'd already be there. We 
had a lot of fun, 
lot of fun. 
GH: have you ever done any fox chasing? 
TB: I never bothered. I'd go out and listen to 'em, though. But I 
never bothered too much with 'em. Lot of 
'em — they just go for the 
chase. 
GH: The sport is to 
listen to the hounds 
TB: Yeah. See whose dog's 
in the lead. 
GH: I was talking to a guy up 
in Mount Misery, real piney type — 
he doesn't do that any more but he used to. He says they would 
put out pipes and stuff for the fox to hide 
in. 
If they had a dog 
that was too good at catching the fox they'd get rid of him. 
Didn't want em to catch the fox that fast. 
TB: Yeah, that's the — we used to have trouble with the fox and 
coon and the houndsmen we'd call 
'em, but then we got together and 
we figured that if 
the trappers and the houndsmen didn't hang 
together. we was gonna hang separately. So we got... 
DM: You're still worried about their dogs getting caught in your 
traps. 
TB: Well, yes. They were — and then we have the head of the 
houndsmen now 
is Leo Galley, and Leo come forth and testified 
that he's had several of his dogs caught and released with no 
harm. He spoke right before the council 
in Brixton and they 
wanted to outlaw all 
trapping in the township of Brixton. That's 
the county seat. 
GH: What's the township your traps are 
in here? 
TB: Millville. Coleman County, Millville township. 
GH: They don't have any restriction on 
it 
in Millville? 
TB: No, not here. What I been doin', I been saving the lower jaw 
I've only got two foxes hangin', that makes me sick, just two the 
first day. Started out good. Then one gone, next day one gone, 
that was 
it. I tell 
you, I can't even find a fox track hardly, 
outside of where I missed that one yesterday — I'd seen that 
track there in deer season. Then with the track bein' froze, why, 
I didn't get him. Maybe it's just as well, because if I catch 
that one, why, have no breeders for another year. But usually 
right around this area, I would pick up 12, 
15 fox. And then that 
was 
it, 
I'd quit. Now I know I had plenty left — but see, I 
pulled up last... 
GH: So you quit for a year or so and let them come back? Do you 
rotate your areas that way. 
TB: You can. I pulled in, 
but see the thing of it 
is, 
usually at 
the end of the season — my season, when I pull up and go catchin' 
just muskrat — why there'll be plenty of fox left. But then who 
knows how many come 
in behind me, and set. And clean them out. 
But Howard is too good. He went to the trapper's college, he has 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 86 
the rating of a professional 
And when he puts those traps down, 
why, he cleans 'em out. 
MB: I don't see where you have to go to college to be a 
professional. I think you're professional. 
TB: I could argue with you, mom, I ain't gonna do 
it. 
MB: Every little bit of fat has to come off his furs, has been 
that way for years, I used to growl about it. And yet he calls 
somebody goes to college because they're professional. 
GH: They go to college to 
learn how to trap? 
TB: They go to trapper's college. He had already... 
GH: You could open up a trapper's college right here. 
MB: I know it. 
TB: But he had, he went out to Indiana to trapper's college, 
it 
was right on Purdue college grounds. So when he got done setting, 
they rated him, give him his certificate as a professional. Some 
are expert, you know, but his was professional. Last year he 
caught 126, but now when he catches 126, my 12 or 15 would equal 
what he had in a way because he's travelin' hundreds of miles a 
day and he's got 80 to 100 traps out. Which makes a definite ( ). 
GH: Who does the ratings? 
TB: ON that? Trappers. Trappers like - they're from all 
over the 
United States. Major Boddicker from Colorado and Gregorson and 
all 
these guys, and then Kermit Sterns from Pennsylvania. I think 
we even have some of 
'em from out around Michigan. 
GH: 
I'm curious about some of the other animals around here. Do 
you have any woodchucks here at all? 
TB: Around here I never saw one. Once in a while there is. Now 
when you go up the parkway, once 
in a while you'll see 
'em on the 
parkway, goin' up the parkway, I have saw 'em there. 
GH: Anybody ever trap woodchucks? 
TB: We have woodchucks, we have 'em brought in for the skinning 
demonstration, see. 
GH: There's no market for their skins. 
TB: I don't think so. I think there 
is some people that eat 
woodchuck. They kill 
'em to eat. I know a lot of our trappers get 
a permit to catch beaver, just for the meat. They eat the beaver. 
DM: Any beaver around here? 
TB: Oh yeah. I figure if we go down - if 
it breaks away and we go 
down there, I'll show you the one lodge here 
in the crick and 
three dams. And that's where I been settin' 
for the muskrat. I 
had Joe down there one day. They sent me - the biologist, he sent 
me the form to fill out to get a beaver permit, and otter permit, 
this year. I don't want it. I like to see the otter, I like to 
see the beaver. The only beaver I ever brought home was caught by 
accident, cost me 103 dollars. I don't bring 'em home. I have 
caught plenty of 
'em and 
let 
'em go. I tell you, the most gentle 
creatures, to 
let go - you talk to 
'em, they calm right down - and 
one morning I thought the darn thing was dead and I seen that 
beaver - oh, 
it was a giant. I believe that beaver - it was a 
blanket beaver, 
it was so 
immense. 
GH: They weigh about 50 pounds, too, don't they? 
TB: Yeah. We had one here 61 and a half pounds. Anyhow, I saw 
this big beaver, at first in 
the darkness I thought it was a 
coon, 
it was a coon set. And I looked and I said, Oh Lord, not 
another beaver. I was thinkin' of that hundred dollars. So I said, 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 87 
I'll 
get my trap off of his foot and get it out of here. So I 
leaned over, pulled the trap back against my knee, and 
it was a 
longspring, I pulled the spring, and away he went. I didn't know 
he was alive. Man, 
if that thing'd ever swung around, he coulda 
took a chunk out — but they don't. And then another time, just 
maybe 200 yards from there, I went down and I looked out, and at 
first I thought I had, what do you call 
it, 
the nutria? And I 
thought maybe one of them had come up there. Then I saw, no, 
beaver. And I only had just a little light stick, and he coulda 
pulled out — it was only a muskrat trap, and he coulda pulled out 
if 
he coulda got purchase. But every time he pulled, this here 
sapling would give. 
If you ever seen anybody go through water 
fast, I did. I got out there, and 
it was only a kit — I don't 
think the thing weighed over 15 pounds. And I talked to 
it, 
you 
know, and I say I could have petted it, 
it was that gentle. And 
then I just leaned down and opened the trap and away 
it went. The 
otter — I like to see those. You know sometimes 
DM: Where do you find them? 
TB: Oh, all over. I can show you where one was up 
last Sunday, 
here. Right down here where I got these here muskrat traps. But 
see, now you just comin' 
in, 
and I only trappin' about a hundred 
yards, and I think 20 rats, I just about took 'em out. 
GH: How do you keep from catching otter when you set? Just a 
different size trap, or different set? 
TB: Well, I leave that up to Mister Otter. He's smart enough to 
stay out of that trap himself. 
GH: So, you can set for rat and you won't get otter. 
TB: Yeah. Oh, well 
now, once in a while you will. I caught one 
down on the state meadow, and I had the shiniest muskrat trap you 
ever seen. Like I said, 
it couldn't get the purchase to pull out, 
so he pulled that stake up, then he got the stake all 
tangled up. 
He 
leveled that muskrat house. And then when he could get where 
he could pull, why he just pulled it right out. This trap, that 
Woodstream has now, I think I was the only one sprung it on my 
hand. They've been holdin' coyotes, otter, and all 
the different 
animals they catch. They say they been workin' on 
it for eight 
years. And Pete Askins was the Woodspring trapper was 
demonstratin' 
it. And I sprung 
it on my hand, and I took that trap 
like that and pulled my hand right out of 
it. But they said that 
with the animals, no way, they don't do 
it. 
MB: I wonder why. 
TB: The only thing is, I can see, 
is with the fur on there, where 
my finger is smooth, with that fur, that rubber on there creates 
a suction that holds. 
GH: So this is that rubber—jawed trap. 
TB: Yeah, the rubber—jawed trap. See, now if we had, 
if they 
passed the 
law and we had to replace our traps with that — 50 
dollars a dozen. 
GH: Bet the trap manufacturers are all 
in favor of that. 
TB: See that's what they were shovin' 
it for. And 50 dollars a 
dozen and then 
if a raccoon, first time he's 
in there, and lots of 
times a fox, 
if a raccoon chews that rubber off, 80 cents for 
replacement. So you take a raccoon, 
if you have to replace that — 
and 
it isn't so much the 80 cents replacement as the work to do 
it. You gotta bring the trap in, 
knock them rivets out and 
Hunn--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 88 
everything 
GH: You can't just put the rubber on your existing traps? 
TB: No, you can't do 
it. But see here's the thing, 
if 
it had 
passed, as somebody said it might work, 
is that it says "cushion 
jaws". So like one fur buyer says, put some rubber tape on 
it, 
it's cushioned. But they didn't go for it. Well actually, 
it 
wasn't too bad 
if 
you figured out it was 20 to 14, but if you'd 
had 4 votes, then that 20 — we woulda won, 
18 to 16, 
see. So 
it 
was close vote on that. But I can't see any way we can hold 'em — 
this 
is what gets me though. I got all 
those antiques out there, 
that's hangin' 
in the cabin and all, and they'd take them. They 
reimburse me fifty cents apiece. I got thirty, forty dollars in 
some of those traps. 
MB: That's terrible. 
DM: They can actualy take them — it's not like an antique firearm 
would be considered? 
TB: 
I'd say. 
like I got up and spoke at the trappers' meeting — I 
said, 
If they can pass a law to take our traps and reimburse us 
fifty cents, they can take those guns. They can pass another law 
and take the guns. 
GH: Don't you have any congressmen or senators that can fight for 
you? 
TB: we had Zanes— Zanes fought for reimbursement, but they 
appropriated 350,000 — which would amount to the state of New 
Jersey, about fifty cents a trap, Zanes said. But now you — with 
our antiques, here's what I would be willing to accept — if they 
take our traps, 
if we get caught settin' 
'em, we pay the fine, they 
can take the trap, see. But to come 
in and where we got 'em 
in a 
building hangin', I can't see 
it. No way. We're not usin' those 
traps. I can't go along with that. No way. And I don't think our 
constitution would allow 'em to come in and get 'em. The only way I 
think they're gettin' around that is by that reimbursement. 
DM: They're asking for you to voluntarily bring 
in your traps. 
TB: Yeah, bring 'em 
in. 
DM: And 
if 
you were caught using a steel trap 
TB: Or have 'em 
in your possession, that's the way it's worded. 
DM: I don't think they would get a permit to raid your... 
TB: Well, I tell you one thing, I've always set this here exhibit 
up, every year. I won't set it up no more. No way, because then 
they might come 
in and take the whole exhibit. And like I told 
you, 
I've had some of them since I was 14 years old. I gave 14 
cents, took my lunch money and paid for the trap. Had a penny 
I 
of t. 
MB: I don't know why they do things like this. 
TB: You wanta take a walk back to the cabin? We should have a 
fire back there. 
MB: Well, they can do some funny things, I'll 
tell 
you.

A: Yes, we see several different kinds... about three different 
varieties. 
There's the yellow salt (probably Spartina patens--
EH); see where it 
looks a little darker colored... that's the 
black grass (probably Juncus girardi:EH); now that'll be coming 
up first, 
in a couple weeks it'll start to show... see, 
looks a 
bit green now. 
Q: 
So that's the black grass? 
A: 
Yeah, that's what we call 
it. 
I don't know (if that's) the 
right name. 
Q: 
Are those the only two kinds...? 
A: 
No, there s what we call 
rosemary (probably Distichlis 
spicata:EH). 
And the yellow salt'll grow up (?) and then bend 
over. 
Rosemary'll grow straight up, (leaves) come off of 
it 
(describing how blades grow straight out from stem, stiffly), and 
it has a little bit of a hollow tube (stem)... 
We cut 'em all 
three, the same thing.... Then you have the sedge grass (Cyperus, 
or Scirpus ?:EH) mixed in with 
it 
in the lower areas. 
Sedge 
grass is no good; 
it'll just rot away. 
But now the salt hay... 
that'll 
last years and years (under ground); you can dig it up 
and 
it's still there. 
Whereas the sedge (unintelligible) ... and 
that's one reason they like salt hay on highway jobs, where 
there's a steep slope (to hold soil 
in place). 
We don't sell 
directly to the highway department, sell 
to the contractors that 
do the work. 
Q:: What's all 
that turf piled up over there? 
A: That's where I've been working. 
If not for the dike, the 
water would be deep on the salt hay field by now. (Comment on 
high tides and full moon.) 
Q: 
Is that yellow hay here? 
A: Yes, that's the second growth (already been cut). 
Ready to 
cut around the first of July. 
It's not like alfalfa; you only 
cut 
it once a year. 
But this water breakin' 
in, 
it's not all 
bad. 
because this is our fertilizer, get some nutrients out of 
the water. 
If you don't have a break, we might open up the dike 
in 
the spring to get some water out on the field. 
Then get the 
nutrients, and also the salt water keeps the weeds down. 
If you 
didn't have that you wouldn't have salt hay. 
Sluice it on spring 
tides. 
(tractor off as we arrive at the site of his diking work) 
Q: 
Is that your back hoe too? 
A: 
Yeah. (climbing out of the cab)

A: 
This 
is not even the bayshore, 
it's ,just off of a crick. 
But 
I go down to my bayshore. and I go home and I'm depressed for two 
days, because I see what I'm trying to do and I see how 
ridiculous it 
is (to try to keep the ocean out). 
Q: How much have the water levels come up 
in the last 20 to 30 
years? 
A: 1 would say, a couple feet. 
I know it sounds like a lot, 
but... two feet don't sound like much, but when you're working 
the 
land, two feet's the difference between workin' and bein' 
underwater. 
Only way we keep the salt hay 
is to regulate the 
water (due to 
its fine tolerance). 
Let it 
in 
in spring, etc. 
Q: 
Is there kind of a band of salt hay between where it's too 
sal ty, etc. 
A: 
If 
it wasn't banked, yeah, as a natural, 
it's own elevation, 
even 
in this flat marsh you can see three or four varieties 
strictly from, when you're talking elevation out here your 
talking inches, and you still have you're different crops in that 
couple of 
inches. 
You have your black grass on the highest 
elevations, then comes your rosemary and 
your salt grass, then comes your sedges. 
Like I said, 
inches of 
difference between the grasses. 
When you go below sedges you're 
under water. 
Q: And above, you have Phragmites? 
A: Well that phragmites'll adapt. 
It'll start on the higher 
ground, but then that root systems'll spread, grow right out into 
the water. 
That's the bad thing about that, 
it'll adapt. 
Anything that's no good'I1 adapt. 
And the higher you get, 
like 
over by that island, you get elder bushes, they'll grow up on the 
banks higher. 
Then you get into your blue bent (grass sp., 
unidentified:EH) and y'ou 
go to your upland type of vegetation. 
Q: 
So you can really read the landscape. 
A: Yeah, 
it's funny, when you live with something, you don't 
think much about it, 
but when you see 
it through your eyes, when 
you're studying something. 
Q: What kind of trees are (those out on the islands)? 
A: Your maple and your gum, 
is what's out there. the main thing. 
Q: Do you see people come around here to cut plants? 
I know they 
use phragmites in floral displays... 
A: Not commercially they don't, no. 
You may see some women stop 
along the roadside to grab a handful, something like that. 
I did 
have a weed a friend of mine whose a florist was coming down 
cutting it and dyeing it, 
red and blue, using it 
in floral 
arrangements, christmas time. 
He'd cut about a small truck load 
of 
it. 
He was selling it for 2.50 a little bunch. 
Q: Do you have any cattails out here? 
A: 
No, they grow in fresh water; you find it further up, not here 
in 
the salt water. 
Q: I understand there are two kinds of cattails, the narrow— 
leaved one growing in brackish water. 
A: Close to the upland you can get it, 
out here it's too salty, 
too brackish, out there you see 
is the bay. 
On your way out look 
at that one home I was showin' you, you see how far out 
in 
the 
bay that one home 
is; and the bay shore was well beyond that 
before 1950. 
Well there's out 
in the bay here--they still hit's 
it occasionally if they know where it's at--year's ago a fella

Q: What's the life of a salt hay f 
the seasons of work? 
A: This time of year now is mainly working on banks. 
But we 
Still have some market occasionally I can get in the marsh and 
hay. 
Well week before I got three loads out. 
The beautiful 
thing about salt hay 
is we can stack it, just put plastic over 
it, 
can stack 
it 
in July, ship 
it out 
in January. 
It just don't 
rot. 
July, August, September, October (do most of the harvest). 
Then 
if we have good weather, and we work right, by the end of 
October, November we've got (unintelligible). 
But can harvest 
year round. 
Main market is 
in the winter, starts in October, 
November, & December; dies in February when it (the weather) gets 
too bad. 
But that's when we sell 
the most of 
it. 
When the 
weather turns too bad construction stops. 
Q: How many miles of dikes do you maintain? 
A: 
My own self, I'd say, fifteen. 
Built all himself over the 
years. 
Q: 
Would there be any examples of the different kinds of grass 
that would still have their seeds on them? 
A: No... (unintelligible). 
Now this is your black grass, see how 
soft that feels. You can feel 
the difference. 
This is your 
yellow salt, just a little bit heavier stem, a different quality 
to i

Q: I guess you can't sort them out (sell each kind separately).

it.

Little leaf, stem like, 
that comes of 
it, 
then that has little bit of a hollow core to 
it.. 
If my eyes were better I could see. 
But you can see the 
difference. 
I imagine there are scientific names to them, but... 
Q: Everybody has to have there own names for things. 
Scientist 
may have there names for it but often don't know much else about 
it 
A: 
Yeah, I've been trying to get (a campground started--on a 
piece of his property), something to get my family into 
it.

there were seven endangered species of grass there, you know; one 
of the people 
in the audience asked him what they was, and he 
said he just knew the latin names. 
So he started to name them. 
So (the person in the audience) asked him what they were in 
English. 
Well, he's so worried about them and he didn't even 
know what they was! 
Them kind of things kind of destroy the 
credibility of environmentalists. 
They want to stop you just to 
be stopping you, 
they don't even know what they're worried 
about. 
Q: 
(EH comment) 
how rare plants 
in Pine Barrens do best on 
disturbed ground, need human disturbance 
A: Proved the same thing about burning; after they studied found 
they had to burn to get some plants to germinate. 
I guess that's 
one reason I (dislike?) this DDT so bad (unintelligible). 
They 
come out here (spraying DDT) and killed every natural enemy the 
mosquito had. 
But they (mosquitos) were able to adapt. 
They 
wiped out everything else; thank goodness they quit. 
Q: How are the mosquitos out here? 
A; 
Oh, they grow! (laugh) part of 
life. 
If anybody says they get 
used to 
'em, they's a big liar. 
But you learn you just have to 
live with them. 
I guess you do get used to them. 
They're not as 
bad out here as when you get into the edge of the uplands. 
Cause 
out here you normally (unintelligible, wind). 
Q: I didn't know mosquitos bred in salt water. 
A: 
Oh yes, you've got the salt marsh mosquitos, they breed 
in the 
swamps, here. 
Where we keep meadows dry for haying, the 
mosquitos are still 
laying their eggs; then a big storm comes in 
and wets the meadows (they all hatch); what can you do? 
You got 
to choices (to stop them): you either flood the whole meadow and 
leave 
it completely under water, or you never let 
it get dry 
in 
the first place; I mean you never let 
it get wet. 
(unintelligible) 
They (tourists, vacationers...) move in here 
for what we've got, but then they don't want everything we've 
got, they don't want the mosquitos... 
Q: Are there a lot of people just come out here for the weekend? 
A: Like you're Iookin' out down there (pointing to beach front 
cabins near East Point light), but the bay has gone so bad it's 
even chased most of them away. 
But down along the seashore, 
seashore beaches is where your campgrounds, etc., are. 
Q: What do you sell your salt hay for? 
A: 3.50 a bale, plus freight. 
Q: How big 
is a bale. 
A: Baler is 14 X 18 inches, then we set it for 3 foot lengths. 
Q: 
Do you dry 
it out first? 
A: 
yea, just like any other hay crop. 
When we're hayin' 
it's not 
that wet out here. 
In the winter we can hay pretty wet meadows. 
I just raise the mower up just a little bit, cut and the hay'll 
fall 
on the stubble, then I come with my baler and leave that set 
up, 
and I can bale 
in meadows that are pretty damp and get dry 
hay. 
But in the summertime, 
like any other hay, 
leave 
it a 
couple of days to cure, and the meadow's dry at that time. 
(taking pictures) 
Q: Do you know how many bales you get off of an acre? 
A: 
No, 
it varies all 
over the place. 
Just like upland, you got 
meadows that grow good crops and meadows that grow good crops. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 95 
It'll vary from year to year. 
About three years ago we had an 
excellent crop (No, 
it 
isn't deteriorating.) 
It varies, weather, 
and 
it's according to... we're here 
in brackish water, but you 
need a certain amount of fresh water in the spring to get a good 
crop. 
I guess (fresh water flushed out salt). 
Q: Can you just look at a meadow and tell how good it's going to 
be 
A; No, not until the season gets pretty well advanced. 
Naturally, you have some meadows that always raise a better crop 
than others, just like upland. 
Some of the soils is better than 
others. 
Sometimes when a meadow's not doing well, we 
let 
it go 
two years. 
We call that double crop, very simple. 
You can do 
that again simply because it doesn't rot. 
The crop will stay 
there until the next year. 
Q: Does it grow up better if you cut it every year? 
Doesn't it 
tend to choke itself out? 
A: No, 
if you 
let 
it go two years, the second year's actually 
better. 
Of course you can't let 
it go too many years because 
then it'll 
start to bog up. 
It'll turn into a bog. 
It'll go 
softer. 
With several crops underneath, the meadow'II soften up. 
It's a little more expensive than regular hay (Joe Czarnecki 
comment). 
Fresh hay (price) fluctuates quite a bit, whereas salt 
hay (prices) don't. 
We sort of set the price and stay there. 
Q: 
(Joe Czarnecki) 
What do people use 
it for mostly? 
A: Cement work, sewer work mostly, mulching, septic systems. 
You 
put down your stone bet, then you put your salt hay on 
it. 
All 
of your ordinances calls for either salt hay or untreated tar 
paper; but see your tar paper don't let the bed breathe, they 
keep the (unintelligible) from goin' down in 
it. 
You put salt 
hay on, 
it 
lets moisture come up through the ground as well 
as no 
(moisture?) going down in. 
So your salt hay (is better). 
END SIDE ONE. 
Q: 
How many bales do you cut in a year, approximately? 
A: Thousands... I guess we ship 180 trailer loads, this year; 420 
bales per load. 
(=5040 bales, or about 1000 cu meters!:EH). 
Q: That's a lot of hay! 
And Ezra Cox (whom we briefly met when 
we first arrived at the hay field) 
is the other main salt hay man 
here? 
A: Yeah, but he 
lost a lot of his meadow over to Moore's beach. 
The banks got out on him till 
it just got to the point where he 
couldn't save them. 
Q: How do they decide who's meadow is whose? 
A: 
We have ownership out here just like you do on the uplands. 
Q: So 
it's not state land then? 
A: No. 
But the state bought this. 
I don't know what's going to 
happen in 
'85, I think the state's going to start claiming a lot 
of 
it. 
Well the state bought this from a family named Cadwater, 
years ago they owned thousands and thousands of acres around 
here; they (the state) bought it from the estate. 
Q: What were they (the previous owners) doing with it? 
A: I don't know; that was back before my time, back in early 
times when they had 
it. 
I think they got it on grants and 
things; 
it goes way back. 
I understand that back on the farm where I 
live, back 
in colonial times, they grew wheat out in them

around there by putt

Q: 
Is there much pressure for development around here? 
A: No, never been that much down here. 
Q: 
Is there any market for the wild rice here. 
A: No. 
And there's not as much of that 
around here as there 
used to be, cause the salt is getting up the rivers, further, and 
it's killing it out. 
(Joe Czarnecki: asking about red color of 
mud 
in puddle) 
I think it's just iron oxide that's been leached 
out. EH: comment, 
like 
iron bog ore. 
(noise) 
Q: 
Is there hunting out here? 
A: 
Yeah, over there out back 
is where your duck hunting is 
(on 
the sea side of the dike, using boats). 
Q: 
Can you tell me some more about the effect the geese have on 
the habitat? 
A: Well, they don't effect me (salt haying), but in the outer 
shore area, when they are plentiful, they come into a meadow and 
they eat the root, they destroy them; when they leave you just 
got a mud flat. 
Q: 
Are there a lot more of them than there used to be (Snow 
Geese). 
A: Yeah, thousands. 
The white, not the blue kind. 
Q: Do they have a hunting season on them? 
A: Yeah, they didn't used to, they were supposed to have been 
near extinct, but they've come back now. 
Q: But they (the snow geese) don't eat salt hay? 
A: No, they eat the sedges. 
(sounds of feet sucking muck and climbing up through phragmites 
grass onto top of old dike for view of channel and sedge grass 
marsh.) 
Q: 
That's the sedge grass (out there). 
A; 
Yeah, and the phragmites'll grow out there as well 
as 
in 
here. 
Q: 
Is that where the ducks 
A: Yeah, 
in the sedge, they'll 
nd a little higher spot. 
Q: Mallards? 
A; Black (black duck 
blacks are just black mallards. 
Q:

marsh (sedge marsh) where they go rail 
gunning? 
A: Yeah, for your sora rail.

Q:

(identified another heron) 
(pointed out how

Q: Are those pines out there or cedar? 
A: Cedar. 
It'll grow in pretty brackish area but your pine won't 
put up with it. 
No, 
it's not your good white cedar (EH:red 
cedar). 
Q: How do you get to those houses way out there? 
A: There's another road; that's East Point. 
You've seen pictures 
of the East Point light house, I'm sure. 
That's pretty. 
Pointing out the top of 
it. 
That's Maurice River mouth just 
beyond it. 
Oyster business out in the bay (not clamming). 
Q: 
I understand the oyster business here's hard hit, by that 
parasite. 
A: Yeah, very hard times. 
They (oysters) came back just a little 
bit, not that much. 
Q: 
Do you mix your salt hay business with bay work? 
A: No, but a friend of mine has. 
Barry (?) over at Port Norris, 
he's 
in the oyster business, but I never have. 
Q: You don't have any Snow Geese around here. 
A: Yes we do, 
they just aren't up and flying about now. 
(Where 
were the one's the pheasant hunter at his house had mentioned?) 
Go down Moore's Beach rd. 
Dikes are out there and the meadows 
are flooded, you can see what happens when you let the dikes go. 
Q: I note the tide seem to be about 10 feet above the 
level 
of 
his field now. 
(noise walking) 
Q: 
So how did you learn the business, from your father? 
A: Yeah, (identified coon and deer tracks; horseshoe crab shell 
in mud). 
It just grows between your uplands and your meadowlands 
(that is, 
the "blue bent" grass). 
I like it on the farm because 
it makes good pheasant cover. 
The winter weather don't take 
it 
down, 
it stays up all winter, makes excellent cover. 
It won't 
survive 
in the salt water , though it can take some of 
it. 
You 
can see it's covered with salt water, but in the growin' 
season... 
Q: 
Is that bayberry out there (shrub growing on the old dikes)? 
A: Bayberry. (not myrtle) 
That don't normally grow out in your 
salt marsh, but because it's higher (on the dike)... or on 
land 
like a little island. 
Also your "elder bushes" (unidentified low 
deciduous shrub:EH). 
Little white flower, no fruits. 
Horseshoe 
crabs come 
in here 
in the millions, used to grind 'em up for 
fertilizer. 
(milk them for medicine?:EH) 
There's good meat in 
there, cut a strip out (near junction of fore part and thorax). 
Even though there's millions of them out there they're on the 
endangered species list or something. 
Can't stop 'em. 
I cut 
this off, and that off, and steam it, 
cut it with a knife, split, 
there's two pieces of meat there 
size of your finger or your 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 98 
thumb. 
Then you saute that, tastes just like your blue—claw 
crab. 
I'd never heard of anybody eating it, 
but I just got 
curious and had to try 
it. 
It was good! 
I offered some to my 
daughter. 
I said, "is that good..." 
She said, "yeah." 
When I 
told here what it was, she set the plate down! 
Those things now 
(horseshoe crabs) there weren't nearly as many of them this year. 
The year before there were so many they did an awful 
lot of 
damage. 
They come in onto the beach, an on the crick, and claw 
in there to lay their eggs. 
And they would just cave the whole 
crick bank out. 
They cave my whole bank 
in. 
And so I had to go 
back 
in and build new banks in. 
This year I'd say there was only 
about a third as many; evidently they got to be so many that some 
disease went through them. 
I think it's same thing they do wrong 
in spraying them gypsy moths. 
I feel 
if they'd just let em went, 
let nature create a disease 
in 
'em, we'd be better off. Because 
sprayin' they just kill enough off to keep em multiplying. (EH 
commentary...) 
Because I'll 
tell you another thing, been about 
15 years ago now, something called the army worms, come 
in our 
marsh, an every thing I let go--what I call two—crop--they ate 
everything. 
It looked like a fire had gone through. 
They ate 
everything green out there. 
Well, we didn't have the political 
pull 
or the money or anything to start spraying, so there wasn;t 
anything we could do about it. 
Two years they was here; then a 
disease or something came 
in here and wiped 'em out. 
We haven't 
seen 'em since. 
I think the same thing would've happened with 
the gypsy moth. 
If they hadn't gotten in there and started with 
all 
the spraying. 
Sometimes I think us humans is too smart for 
our own good. 
Used to grind them for fertilizer (horseshoe 
crabs) and used them a lot in chicken feed, now the only thing I 
know is they use them for eel bait and like that. 
Q: 
There's some kind of, they milk them, for some kind of 
medicine. 
A: 
Yeah, I guess they're related to scorpion or something like 
that. 
I guess they're the oldest living creature on the earth. 
Q: 
What time of the year do you see them most often? 
A: Well 
they come 
in 
in April to 
lay there eggs.. You can tell 
when they come 
in down at my place cause you hear the seagulls 
down on the beach, they go 
in there and start feeding on their. 
Just a little tiny white egg. 
If you dig 
in the mud with a 
shovel 
it seems you get more eggs than mud. 
Q: 
Do you have snapping turtles down here? 
A: 
Oh yeah, diamondbacks and your big snappers, and all 
that. 
In 
summer your diamondbacks (Northern Diamondback Terrapin, 
Malaclemy terrapin, a salt marsh—loving species:EH) and your 
snappers (Chelydra serpentina:EH) they all 
come up on our roads 
and things and 
lay their eggs. 
Diamondbacks were commercial 
years ago, then they got scarce and they were outlawed (i.e., 
harvest for flesh:EH). 
(Joe Czarnecki asking about big hole 
George dug with his backhoe to get material for the new dike: to 
patch a whole broken 
in the old dike). 
(George explains how he 
has to work, over new d 
i 
ke twice when the mud of the f 
i 
rst 
building effort "runs on you. ") 
So I have to 
let 
it firm up a 
bit before I finish it off. 
Q: How did your father do this before they had backhoes? 
A: Well, before '50 we didn't have to do this. 
We had natural 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 99 
banks and the tide wasn't so high. 
I think the tide 
is up more 
than the two foot, but I hate to tell 
you what I think (you won't 
believe it?). 
(noise of wind) 
When you stop and consider that 
we didn't use any banks (then) and you see how high the water is 
right now, that's real evidence (of higher sea levels). EH: 
comment on 
land sinking due to oil 
drilling in Los Angeles.) 
Well some--I don't go along with the theory--some claim South 
Jersey land 
is down cause we're shipping so much sand, but I 
can't go with that theory cause (its too local a phenomenon). 
I 
think its the displacement of water (by silt runoff out of 
rivers). 
I'll 
run you up (to your cars), then I gotta come back 
here and work. 
Q: You've got cedar poles on your wagon. 
A: Yeah, I was thinkin' I was gonna go out here and try to fix 
(the whole 
in the old dike), and then I got lookin' at 
it and 
backed off of 
it. 
(All 
his current efforts are 
in order to out 
off the water coming 
in through the break in the old dike.) 
Q: 
Those old dikes, when did you make them? 
A: That one there's been there quite a while, probably done late 
60's. 
(trees and shrubs have grown up on 
it --including a cherry 
tree) 
See that's your progression; you have your salt marsh, 
black grass, your blue bent, and then you get into trees and your 
bayberries. 
(climbing into tractor, pictures...) 
(tractor noise) 
#315 
(unintelligible) 
(George explains that he's still fighting for the permits to 
build his campground--it's in a rare spot, a bluff overlooking 
the river--but that a wealthy man downriver from the site 
is 
blocking it because he doesn't want people boating down past his 
plane. 
The wealthy industrialist named is Wheaton. 
He then told 
about the Wheaton industries, here and overseas.) 
Wheaton 
grandfather started it, Father continued it. 
Companies in China, 
in Colombia, South America. 
Q: 
Do you think that tourist business might be a good one to get 
into around here? 
A: Well, where I have this site is right up on the river, a 
beautiful, beautiful site. 
There not that much of 
it 
in this 
area (places like this site), 15-20 foot bluff overlooking the 
river and a lot of meadowland. 
Beautiful spot. 
I was going to 
incorporate it with fishing, boating„ camping. 
(about renting 
canoe business) 
Too much tide 
in the river for canoeing. 
OK if 
the people knew what they was doing, but most don't. 
They'd be 
drownin' themselves. 
(Pointing out the taller, coarser variety 
of yellow hay; says 
it has the same kind of seeds.) 
It looks 
just like 
it 
'cept it's a little bit coarser. 
Black hay comes up 
first. 
It's funny, 
if 
you don't out that one why it'll 
lie, 
it'll 
all 
sort of turn dark, 
it gets greasy, just lays down and 
disappears. 
You don't get much of a crop out of 
it. 
Yellow salt 
is 
the mainstay. 
Used to have an Osprey nesting near Port 
Maurice. 
On my farm I've got about 30 deer. 
They're not 
afraid; they just walk around the (pheasant) gunners; they don't 
leave. 
(He had also noted presence of a Bald Eagle about his 
place this winter, despite the hunting.) 
(We both comment on how 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 100 
some people think wild animals can't tolerate human presence; not 
so, 
if you don't harm them, they learn that they're safe.) 
Q: When do you see those turtles, those diamondbacks? 
A: 
July. 
(Joe wants him to stop at the makeshift bridge/culvert 
we had crossed on our way in--constructed on small 
logs--for a 
picture.) (I continued my question about the turtles, where they 
are 
in winter:EH) 
Yeah, they're (turtles) out in the bay 
(hibernating) 
Q: 
Is that a sluice box over there (in the ditch bank)? 
A; No. 
If we put a gate on 
it, 
it'd be a sluice box. (humor) 
So you like my fancy bridge, huh. 
Well, we hauled a 68,000 pound 
crane acrost it. 
But there's some sleepers under, you can see 
the ends stickin' out. 
Q: Are there any bales left 
in your shed (back at the house)? 
A: Down the road I had some. 
(EH commenting on baling hooks for 
bucking bales) (Apparently he used the same) 
Q: How much does a bale (weigh). 
(50-75 pounds)

TX01: WALKING IN WOODS NEAR G—Warren Grove; 56GT 
JC:Sharpening 
axe. EH; Do you sharpen your axe every day. JC:Yes, every day, 
it 
pays. It's a lot easier to work. EH: 
Why two chain saws? JC:AII 
depends on what size tree you're cutting. 
If you're cutting 
smaller trees, stuff like this, you use the smaller chain saw 
(14" bar:EH). 
If you cut bigger trees use the bigger one (16" 
bar:EH). EH: Asked about birds in area. 
JC: There's a series of 
islands 
in there (behind the bog), and right now all 
the ducks 
are breeding. 
(noise) Mallards and Black Ducks. 
Used to have a 
lot of Wood Ducks nest in these dead trees here, but don't see 
many the 
last couple of years. 
EH: Any idea what's happened to 
them? 
JC: Yeah, they're getting people with young boys here. 
With 22's. 
See, the old timers, they'd protect 'em. 
These new 
people come in, 
they don't know the difference. 
EH: So where are 
these young boys from, stay 
in some of these retirement 
communities or... JC: 
Well we had two families that moved 
in 
from the city here, had children, and even some of the old 
natives (kids). ( EH: What's that pole for 
in back of truck.) 
JC:It's my measuring stick, to show how long the bean poles are; 
eight feet (long). 
EH:What kind of beans are they growing? 
JC:Limas, pole beans. 
EH:Where are most of the beans grown 
around here? JC:Well, these poles are for a farmer in South 
Jersey, 
in Woodstown, way down towards Delaware. 
One of the 
farmers was here two weeks ago, took all 
that I had; now his 
neighbor found out about where he got 'em, 
he want's them; that's 
how it goes. 
EH: How much do you sell them for? JC: Fifty cents 
a piece. 
EH: (Cedar) that's the best kind of wood? 
(noise) 
(will 
last for a long time.) 
EH: 
What kind of bushes grow out 
in 
the bog there? 
JC: 
Well, you got maple comin' up. 
We call 
that (pointing to Chamaedaphne calyculata or Ieatherleaf:EH) "hef 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 102 
brush," biggest nuisance we have. 
1 don't know if that's the 
right name for it, 
but that's what we call 
it, hef brush, h-e-f 
brush. 
And that keeps spreadin' and spreadin', and it covers the 
whole bog, don't know if you can see it. 
It starts off a small 
patch, course 
if you were working cranberries, you'd be pullin' 
it, 
takin' 
it out 'o there. 
No (fruits on 
it 
). 
EH: What's that tall 
reddish grass out there? 
JC: That's 
what they call here savannah grass. 
Ever hear of savannah grass; 
you find 
it (growing) right out in the middle of the ponds. 
Great big patches grows from the bottom; 
its clay bottom, nothing 
else grows there; a scrubby little pine, a little something but 
savannah grass. No(not good for anything). 
(In response to 
question about Andropogon sp., but thinking of some sort of 
sedge, I believe, perhaps a species of Scirpus:EH) 
JC: This 
is 
maple, yes (the swamp maple) (in contrast with the "upland 
maple":EH). 
EH: 
Where's the upland maple grow around here? 
JC: 
There isn't too much of 
it. 
Only in some areas. 
(noise) 
EH: 
Are there some berries around here that people, that are worth 
picking. 
JC: Oh yeah, this place... and huckleberries, 
in July 
it's all 
blue (here) with huckleberries. 
EH: So, people like to 
pick wild huckleberries? 
JC: Yeah (old timers), the young people 
don't know too much about it. 
Old timers, they like a 
huckleberry pie rather than a blueberry pie anytime. 
Cultivated 
blueberry, cultivated blueberry's nice lookin', but it just don't 
have the taste. 
Well that's where I'm gonna out these bean 
poles. 
EH: What's the name of this place right here? 
JC: No, 
this 
is the little dam, then we got the main dam over there goes 
all 
the way crost the swamp. Then there's another dam that 
separated the open bottom for a reservoir. 
There's two dams 
going all 
the way across the swamp. 
They call this the little 
dam cause 
it only goes that far to the end there. 
Then there's 
another dam (unintelligible) 
EH: So did you build these dams yourself? 
JC: No, they were 
built before my time. 
See this dam goes all 
the way across to 
the main dam over there. (unintelligible) 
EH: 
Long time ago? 
You had to build a dam around a cranberry bog (as these were 
originally:EH) so you could flood the bog during the winter time 
so the roots don't freeze up. The roots freeze on the cranberry 
vine, 
it won't bear it. 
EH: 
Is this bush with the red twigs, 
is 
that some kind of... JC: 
It's a huckleberry bush. 
EH: That's the 
kind people like to pick? 
JC:In a couple months there'll be 
berries there. 
EH: Does this huckleberry have a lot of seeds in 
it? 
JC: Yeah, 
it has seeds in 
it, 
yes. 
EH: Different from the 
cultivated blueberry? 
JC: Well, the cultivated blueberry has 
seeds also. 
This area's full 
of blueberry (huckle?), this 
is all 
huckleberries in through there, all 
that brush is. 
EH: That's a 
real 
tall huckleberry, I thought the huckleberry was shorter? 
JC: Well there 
is short ones also, the upland blues (blue 
huckleberry??) 
is short. but the swamp blues are shrubs, great 
big shrubs. 
This 
is a swamp blue(berry?) right here. 
This'll be 
all 
in bloom in a couple of months. 
The whole area'll be 
in 
bloom. 
(swamp blueberry hucklelswamp blue huckleberry, or 
whatever, 
is apparently Vaccinium corymbosum, wild source species 
Hunn-$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 103 
of cultivated blueberries:EH) 
CZ: (unintelligible, asked why he 
used axe instead of chain saw to cut bean poles) JC: The small 
stuff, for bean poles, 
it's a lot easier for me (to use axe). 
CZ: 
It only takes one or two whacks. 
JC: Yeah, you just give it 
a little whack on each side and you cut. 
EH: Jack's in cutting 
some bean poles from a stand of small cedars a couple inches 
in 
diameter. 
EH: 
Is this that "hef brush." 
JC:No, that's not 
huckleberries, not hef brush either, 
it something else 1 don't 
know the name of 
it. 
That's this one right here. 
There's 
something like this we call 
"sheep laurel." (But he was 
indicating Ilex glabra or inkberry:EH) 
EH: 
Is that sheep laurel 
right there by your axe blade? (Indicating Kalmia 
angustifolia:EH) 
JC: This is, 
yeah. 
EH: What about this stuff, 
what do you call this? 
(Indicating Smilax sp. probably S. 
glabra:EH) 
JC: That's briar. 
EH: You have to be careful of 
it 
or 
it'll bite you. 
JC: A boy about six years old. He and another 
boy were playin' horse; he was the horse, the other fella was 
ridin' him, you know, he was imitating a horse where he'd walk 
along side and chew brush. 
He chewed that darn stuff (sheep 
laurel) and it killed him. 
EH: 
Is that sheep laurel? JC: Yessir. 
That'd kill ya. 
EH: I guess not too many people eat it though. 
JC: I guess not! 
EH: So he didn't have to eat too much of 
it 
either? 
JC: I don't know, how much he had, but he got sick and 
died. 
EH: I guess you got to know your woods plants or you could 
get into trouble. 
JC: Yeah, and another thing about... 
EH: 
Is 
this a cranberry vine here? 
JC: Yessir, they're cranberry vines. 
EH: That's the wild cranberry though? 
JC: No, this was a 
cultivated bog. 
So (here) that's where I'll 
be this week weather 
permitting; I gotta out a hundred of those (bean poles). 
I love 
this work! 
I love this. 
When I first come 
in (here) and smell 
this (cedar), 
it's really beautiful! 
EH: Telling about Yellow 
Cedar, relative of White Cedar, of Washington State mountains. 
JC: Grows up 
in the mountains?? 
EH: What's that tree back there? 
JC: 
It's a maple. EH: That's a pretty good sized one. 
JC: I cut 
all 
the big ones around here for my (fireplace). 
EH: How old 
would you say that tree (maple) is? 
JC: I don't know, but it's 
older than I am. 
You know, talk about age, 
there's a pine tree 
down cross the way from where I was brought up down there, down 
the old homestead, and that's since 1915, to me that tree don't 
look as though it's any different in size today. 
It's one of 
them old pines, you know. 
CZ: recalling maple tree where he grew 
up. 
JC: 
Well these big trees, I can understand how there's an 
awful 
lot of material that has to grow to make it (grow), 
it 
takes a long time. 
And you take some of them little skinny ones 
over there (noise) that one's that are left, you know, and that's 
the truth. 
EH: (That tree) about 15 inches 
in diameter. 
JC: I cut this, and 
it was all 
cedar, about 25 years ago , and 
that tree (the one indicated) looks the same to me as 
it did 25 
years ago. when I was cuttin' here, you know. EH: So you figure 
that (cedar) 
is about 300 years old? JC: I figure it 
is, at 
least. 
And some of those "bull pine," they call those pine that 
grows in cedar swamp, that's a different kind of a pine than the 
upland pine. 
And that has a nicest grain of all 
the wood we have 
Hunn—$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 104 
around here, the bull pine. 
EH: How do you tell 
it from the 
"upland pine"? 
JC: 
It grows 
in the water; 
it grows in the swamp, 
yep. 
There's one over there, see. 
EH: Does 
it have a different 
shape (than the upland pitch pine)? 
JC: Nope, 
it's the same 
needles and all 
but its a harder wood and when you saw it, 
the 
grain--you know what North Carolina pine grain looks like--well 
they used it most for stair treads (the North Carolina pine). 
Well you seen the grain 
in stair treads? 
Well, that's what that 
bull pine looks just like that North Carolina pine that they use 
for trimming. 
Only thing 
is that we don't have enough of 
it here 
to make a business. 
EH: Maybe the pines that grow in the swamp 
grow slower?? 
JC: 
May be a different mineral 
in the swamp than 
you have 
in the upland, course your upland (noise) don't have 
hardly any grain, any real nice lookin' grain to 
it. 
EH: 
What 
do they use the pine for? 
JC: The pine 
is a valuable wood. (You 
frame a house with pine.) 
Pine is used where it don't get wet. 
Now, that's what for years pine was used to frame a house, for 
floor beams, for ceiling, two—by—fours, rafters, but it has to be 
covered away from dampness. 
Because the drier it gets, the 
harder it gets. 
For the outside wood they used cedar, for clap 
board, cedar shingles, that withstood the weather a lot better 
than pine. 
All the old homes 
is built that way. 
Cedar frame and 
covered with cedar. 
Cedar lumber. 
EH: 
What kind of pines do you have around here? 
Bull pine, 
any other kinds. 
JC: 
Well we have a little two—leaf pine 
scattered around, we have short—needle pine, but not too much of 
it. 
EH: I wonder what this bush 
is here? 
JC: Well 
it looks like 
huckleberry to me. 
This 
is mostly huckleberry. 
EH: So the 
huckleberry is different from the swamp blueberry? 
JC: Every 
berry that grows in the woods 
is huckleberry. 
No blueberries 
No blueberries grow in the woods. 
It has to be cultivated. 
It 
becomes blueberry. 
Mrs. White, you see, when she had picked off 
some of the larger berries in the swamp, had em marked, then when 
the season was right to transplant them, she took them and 
cultivated them. 
She crossed them with different berries, so 
that's how you got the blueberries. 
Its a cultivated process, 
yes. 
Mrs. White, she's the one that started it. 
EH: 
When did 
this all 
begin. 
JC: 
I imagine about the turn of the century. 
There were no blueberries when I was a young fella. 
Is she 
livin' yet? 
EH: I don't think so. 
Talking of Whitesbog center 
near Browns Mills. 
JC: I was 
in there a couple of times. 
EH: This bush here with the leaves on 
it, 
is 
it something 
different? 
JC: This 
is bayberry (Indicating Myrica or Ilex 
glabra: EH). 
That's bayberry, that's green all 
year round, 
(noise) 
EH: People cut that for decoration too? 
JC: Oh yes, 
sure,yeah. 
CZ: Are there any circumstances (?catching fish?) 
JC: Some of that has some deep holes in 
it, 
right in the middle 
of the swamp, they get some nice pike (apparently, pickerel: EH) 
out of that. 
That's a little rough gettin in. 
Some of the boys 
get 'em and bring 'em to me because their mothers won't cook 'em 
they look too much like snakes. 
But I love 
'em, boy they're 
good. 
CZ: How about over 
in the pygmy forest (pine plains:EH), 
are there any of these ponds. 
JC: Well there ain't too many 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 105 
ponds or anything 
in the pygmy forest. 
CZ: Well I found one sort 
of a pond there today, I don't know what it was, a swamp... but 
it 
looked like a pretty good sized place. 
JC: Goin' 
in to on 
Bond's (?) place? 
Goin' 
in the bombin' range? 
CZ: You know 
where that Gulf station is on the highway there? The gas station 
highway 72 there? JC: OH,oh,oh,oh. CZ: There's that big wide 
nd, I know ... 
you 
the right hand side 
ready at the edge of 
e ... that's a 
pringy bottom"? JC: 
r name is, 
she lived 
me one time, asked, 
I say, yeah. 
I'd 
said) 
You know 
on 
sand road there. 
JC: Yeah, you 
in Peacock Po 
might find something (i.e., fish) there. 
On 
goin' down? Yeah, Peacock's Pond. 
But you al 
this ? Plains, further south over on that sid 
popular place, Candlewood is, EH: That's a "s 
Conservation society, woman, I forget what he 
in Tom's River, now she 
live 
in... She called 
Mr. Cervetto, you know where Candlewood is? 
like to come down and you take me there. (she 
that woman's pretty near as old as I am, but she could jump that 
brush and go through the woods as well 
as I could. 
Boy, she's a 
tough old lady. 
So the next time she called up she was talkin' 
to some of the Lakewood people, and they come across the name of 
an old sawmill 
in Burlington Co., called Chase's Mill and nobody 
knew where 
it was. 
So she called up again, says Jack, no one 
seems to know where Chase's Mill was, 
you know where 
is 
it? 
Yeah, I know where it 
is? 
We're comin' down, want you to show it 
to us. (she said) 
You ought to see those people; they get down 
on their knees; take pictures of 
little ... And the next popular 
thing with the society up there. 
EH: What society 
is this? 
JC: 
The Conservation Society? There's two of 
'em up there, and then 
there's one, the one're interested in grasses, 
in flowers and 
stuff. 
See, we have a gentian, a blue gentian that grows here 
and that's 
is 
real scarce, and so 
in the last few years the most 
popular grass 
is wire grass, so they wanted to know if I knew 
where "wire grass" was, since I just happened to read about "wire 
grass," I didn't know nothin' about it, 
and I said, yeah, I know 
where "wire grass" 
is. 
Well, 
it must have been 30 or 40 of them 
came down, and I took them out there: There 
it 
is right there (I 
said). 
EH: This is wire grass? (indicating Hudsonia 
erecoides:EH) 
JC: 
It'll only grow where man has disturbed the 
area. 
This grass right there (as above). 
That's wire grass. 
EH:Does that have a flower on 
it? 
JC: 
Yeah. 
They get down 
there on their knees and they take pictures of it and, oh my 
gosh. 
Yeah (excited). 
Wire grass. 
That only grows where man 
has disturbed the area. 
Where the seed comes from I don't know. 
But out here where the government has a station and firelines 
it's just covered with this stuff. 
EH: 
Is this your short—needle pine? 
JC: No, that's the 
regular, the three—leaf pine. (Indicating an individual of Pinus 
rigida:EH) 
There's no short—leaf pine here. 
EH: 
What oaks do 
we have right around here? 
JC: 
Well there's a "turkey oak" 
right there (Indicating Quercus prinus or Q. alba:EH). EH: This 
white one? JC: Yeah, that's turkey oak, the big one over there. 
EH: That's different from the white oak? 
JC: That's a black oak 
right there, the twin, that's black oak. 
Turkey oak has a rough 
bark where your white oak has a smooth bark. 
There's some white 
oak over there. 
The big trees over there. 
EH: Does the turkey 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 106 
oak have a leaf like the white oak? 
JC: Yeah, their leaves... 
This 
is the,what do you call 
this, the oak that grows down 
in the 
dwarf pines. 
The seed comes 
in a great big ball with white 
powder into it (acorn:EH). 
I can't think of the name of the 
doggone thing. 
The leaves are different. 
EH: Is 
it the 
blackjack oak? 
JC: The old timers here had another name for it. 
Can't think of 
it. 
EH: Shall we go on?... (JS showing oak twig 
in cab of his truck.) 
Why do you always carry a branch of pin 
oak? 
JC: I don't know, I always do 
it. 
(laughs). 
EH: Comment: 
Jack apparently misidentified the bayberry for 
Ilex glabra. 
Turkey oak probably is chestnut oak (Quercus 
prinus). 
Black oak of his is probably Quercus velutinus, the 
black oak of botany books. 
Clethra alnifolia not recognized, 
perhaps misconstrued that I was indicating a huckleberry next to 
it. 
EH: 
Explaining paucity of oaks in Washington State. 
JC: We 
have more types of vegetation than any other part of the world. 
We have over 200 species of vegetation that don;t grow anywhere 
else 
in 
the world. 
Hershberger (Harshberger, the Vegetation of 
the New Jersey Pine Barrens:EH) book's where I got that 
information. 
I didn't figure that out myself. 
I just take his 
word for it, I don';t know. 
Size of chain saws noted: 14" and 
16". 
EH: Do you have measuring sticks for each size of thing 
back at home? 
JC: Well, 
if I want a ... for a dock piling I just 
take this (8 foot pole) and give two measures; see this 
is a 
four—footer there (cut marker) 
in the middle (of the 8 foot 
pole)... EH: Nothing ever changes? (referring to roads) 
JC: Every woods road that I remember, all the holes are just 
the same as they ever was when I was a kid. 
It's amazing how 
they hold up. 
EH: You could drive them blindfolded? 
JC: Well, I 
don't know about that. 
EH: This tall shrub along here, 
is this 
the regular laurel? 
JC: That's laurel, yeah. 
This area here, 
just full 
of 
laurel. 
EH: 
Is 
it poisonous too? 
JC: Well, I don't 
know. 
I don't know how poisonous it 
is. 
EH; Are there any other 
poisonous plants out here you have to be careful about? 
JC: Yes, 
yes there is, 
... The only plant that we watch out for the most 
is sweet fern, 
in the summer time, boy that thing is just full 
of 
sand fleas. 
Boy , if you walk through some of the fern brush, 
that fern brush, there's something in that fern brush they like. 
It's covered with 'em. 
You walk through there, you get legs full 
of 
em. 
You got a problem. 
EH: 
Are they the one's that burrow into your skin? 
JC: 
Yeah, and they itch. 
You can't see 
'em. They only thing I use 
for em, 
if I got 'em, and I do every year, 
is alcohol. 
If you 
catch 'em right away with alcohol, you'll kill 
'em, before they 
dig 
in. 
EH; And do you have poison ivy around here. 
JC: Yes, 
... EH: Are you allergic to that? 
JC: Now here's where I got a 
bunch of cedar poles last week. 
(unintelligible) 
EH: 
What's the name of this place again? 
JC: Candlewood, 
that's where the sawmill was. 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 107 
(Indicated hillock which he says 
is sawdust pile from sawmill?) 
EH: 
1745, Candlewood Sawmill. 
EH: JC identified this cedar 
bottom as "springly bottom," showing location of spring. 
EH: 
How many "bottoms" are there? 
JC: There's "clayish bottom," 
"seedyous bottom" (?), 
it's a clearing where Indians or White Men 
have clearly done something with it, you find a lot of that kind 
(of stuff indicating it?) 
in the woods, I don't know if 
I'm 
pronouncing the word right but it's something like seedy—us, 
something like that. 
And "sand bottom," "savannah (?) bottom," 
"oak bottom," "pine bottom," 
it all depends what's growin' on 
top. 
Now, this 
is a "cedar bottom" 
in here. 
It's "springy 
bottom" 
in a "cedar bottom." 
EH: 
Is that a bull pine that's 
growing out in the middle (of the cedar swamp)? 
JC:Yes, 
it 
is. 
EH: 
Is there any demand for that kind of pine anymore? 
JC: 
Well, there would be no trouble selling it. 
I couldn't handle 
(cutting down such a large tree). 
I cut quite a little of 
it 
in 
my time. 
EH; 
Is 
it dangerous cutting down the cedars? 
JC: 
Dangerous? 
There is things that you have to (look out for, know 
about?) 
END OF SIDE ONE. 
BEGIN SIDE TWO. 
EH: 
(How did you learn) how to cut down trees? 
JC: 
It looks 
simple to go 
in there and cut a tree down, but to cut a tree 
down, to cut it right (unclear). 
EH:... they never seem to go 
where you want them to go.... 
JC: 
The main thing 
is that you 
got to watch the breeze. 
I've been up there to cut... I cut them 
pilings for that marina, I've been up here when I couldn't cut 
that day cause the wind was blowing 
in the opposite direction. 
It was blowing away from where I was wanting it to fall when I 
cut. 
You have to 
look for an area where the wind.... You see, 
the wind controls them if the winds blowing. 
That green top up 
there, 
if a little winds blows that, you couldn't hold it no how. 
I always watch that wind and then get to cutting where the wind 
helps you drop 
it where you want to. 
That's a big maple on the 
other side of that cedar, see 
it? 
(unclear) 
EH: 
What kind of 
oak 
is that? 
JC: Black oak. 
EH: 
Does the pin oak have a 
different kind of bark? 
JC: Yeah, pin oak has smooth bark. 
EH: 
This little plant growing here on the ground...? 
JC: That's 
"teaberry." 
Yeah, you can chew it, 
you can taste it too. 
The 
leaves've got just as much taste as the berry itself. 
EH: Do 
you make tea from them or do you just chew on them? 
JC: No, I 
just chew on them. 
That's what teaberry gum's made out of. 
EH: 
It keeps it's berries all 
year around? 
CZ: 
Are the berries good 
too? 
JC: Yeah, sure. 
JC: We used to gather that. 
EH: "Lump 
moss"? (Indicating a green ground—cover moss so called by JC) 
JC: I went where it was nice and thick, and cut it off 
in slices. 
They'd dress a showroom with it, first the bottom, then put the 
other stuff (on top of the moss?). 
That was a popular thing. 
(unclear) 
EH: So a little crick like this, they call a "branch"? 
JC: 
No, they call 
it Candlewood "run". 
EH: And what does 
it run 
into? 
JC: 
It runs into the Oswego. 
Oswego pond, Oswego swamp, 
on the Wading River there, Oswego Lake. 
You know where the dam 
is there on the west side? 
Some of the maps call 
it the upper 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 108 
end of the Wading River, they don't call 
it the Oswego, I don;'t 
know why. 
Oswego's the old Indian name. 
(unclear) 
EH: And 
what's this little brush here, 
is that more huckleberry? 
JC: No, 
I don't think so. 
(unclear) 
EH: 
It's pretty nasty in here, 
is 
this what they call 
the "bull briar"? 
JC: Yeah, bull briar 
alright. 
It has great big white knobs underneath, the Indians 
used for medicine. 
EH: 
Is that under the ground? 
JC: Yeah, on 
the roots, yes. 
The Indians used to make, to boil 
it, 
then 
drink the (juice?). 
It's good for ya, I imagine it's good. 
I 
don't know for what ill. 
Urinary canal, I think (laughs). 
There's nothin' wrong with that. 
(JC indicating "rotten" cedar 
someone had cut down and discarded. 
EH: So what causes 
it to rot 
like that? 
The water comes up too high? 
JC: 
That's rotten 
inside (indicating cedar growing in standing water) 
All 
of 
them's rotten inside. 
But you take that one right straight back 
there now, 
it's healthy. 
EH: Cause 
it grows so straight? 
JC: 
Yeah. 
EH: That one (the rotten one) has got a little kink 
in 
it. 
JC: 
It's survivin' but they're not... 
EH: OK, what's this oak? 
JC: 
That's turkey oak. 
It has a little different leaf (Looking 
at dried leaf of Quercus prinus or chestnut oak). 
EH: 
Turkey 
Oaks get pretty big? 
JC: Yes, they grow real tall. 
(unclear) 
EH: When does 
it start to have its flowers (indicating a gum 
tree, Nyssa sylvatica)? (unclear, but early) What is 
it (why 
is 
the gum a poor tree?), 
is 
it .just too soft (the wood)? 
JC: 
There's no grain to 
it. 
It rots 
in six months (unclear). 
CZ: 
How do you get the trees (when cut) out of here? 
JC: With a 
winch. 
Take a cable 
in there and hook on three or four of 
'em, 
and winch 'em right out. 
EH: Do you do 
it all 
by yourself? 
JC: 
No, I hire, I have a fella do that. 
I do the cuttin', and he ... 
got a four-wheel drive. 
Well, I got a jeep. 
A four-wheel drive 
jeep that I use when I go 
in to get, to cut poles. Use the jeep 
to drag 'em out. 
EH: What kind of wildlife do you have 
in a place like this. 
Birds, mammals, etc. 
JC: Well, the thing you have most plentiful 
is 
raccoon. 
You got a few foxes, rabbits are very scarce, 
red(?) squirrels, (unclear)... 
EH: So that's where your father-
in-law went to school? (Indicating remains of chimney where 
building had stood) 
JC: Yes. 
Candlewood School. 
Took care of 
the kids from Cedar Bridge, quite a few people in Cedar Bridge 
here. 
In fact there were two taverns at one time here 
in Cedar 
Bridge. 
EH: So Cedar Bridge is no more? 
JC: Nah, they don't 
call 
it Cedar Bridge no more. 
Well 
in the 1830's they built--
this 
is Barnegat Township--in the 1830's Barnegat was under 
Stafford, and they built what they called a halfway schoolhouse 
down here at the (?) Road, down there where 539 joins this road, 
on swamp (?) side, and it's still there. 
I've talked to people 
that attended that school, and 
in 
1878 (?) came down to work the 
school, and the Adams, she attended school there, they walked 
them home from school there to Warren Grove. 
It's a mile or 
better. 
Then they had to build another school; well 
in 
1846 
Barnegat separated from Stafford, so Barnegat had to build their 
own school, and Warren Grove built one 
in town there. 
So this 
school (ruins of which we were contemplating) was built in 1878 
or 1879. 
Fire burnt that halfway school house. 
Made the kids 
Hunn-84 Audiocassette logs 
page 103 
walk half way to school. 
Boy, that must have been rough. 
Live 
way back 
in there and have to walk school. 
(unclear: talking 
about how there used to be a town. Now a few families living at 
the site). 
These families new to the area, just moved in, 
live 
there all 
the time, one 
is retired, just died 
in fact, widow 
still 
lives there. 
Her daughter built her place on the same 
property. 
And then there's a fella name of John Hall, a real 
estate man, 
in Waretown, his son lives there. 
EH: Ask about how he got his revoked firewood cutting permit 
reinstated. JC: With all kinds of threats. 
First of all I had to 
get a permit in Barnegat Township. 
EH: 
Is that (permit 
process) just something new? 
JC: Oh yes. 
EH: How much do you 
charge per cord when they cut it? JC: (unclear) (talking about a 
"deer stand" CZ just noticed about 8 feet up on a nearby tree. 
You stand up on 
it and wait for a deer to c

JC explaining how he goes deer 
of 
14 guys, too few for a real drive, ("the

We got four deer, with fourteen men, that's

here, they must have brought some of that shrub 
in from I don't 
know where. 
But it's scattered all 
over there. 
It's a cripply 
thing, something like your dwarf stuff (perhaps he 
is referring 
to the red cedar, Juniperus virginiana?:EH), a worthless thing 
for lumber. 
(unclear) 
If you find a bunch of pine in oak 
bottom, man has been there. 
EH: Will the oak bottom come back 
after a long time? 
JC: No, that pine takes over there and that's 
it. 
I'm talking about when they clear the stumps and all 
out. 
If you just cut down the oak wood it grows right back up again, 
in thirty years it'd be big enough to cut oak again. 
It grows 
back from the stump. 
See that stump there (with lots of suckers 
growing up from it), half of that'll die off... 
It reproduces 
itself. 
All 
of the oaks come back like that. The old oak 
stump'II rot away and feed the new shoots. 
EH: 
You don't have 
to worry about anybody coming along and stealing your logs? 
JC: 
They steal, they stole a lot of cedar off of me. 
EH: About being 
lost. 
About Oswego Lake bridge being out and detouring around. 
EH: Pine bottom here?

up to pine

continued to wood cutting spot. 
EH: Savannah bottom is open, 
maybe same as clayish bottom or a kind of 
it. 
Pines 
in oak 
bottom are not "pine bottom," 
in fact, most have names, 
like X's 
place,... as such pine groves are made possible by people pulling 
the oak stumps out in clearing the 
land. 
Parked 1/10 mi 
north 
of junction of 539 and 532 link 1 mile north of Warren Grove on 
east branch. 
(noise) 
JC: You're talking about the state permit 
(for cutting wood), the Pinelands Commission, that's (permanent), 
unless they revoke it because you're not following Somes' 
regulations, whatever his name 
is. 
See now that's where I cut 
the clam stakes. 
(chain saws of wood cutters in distance) 
EH: 
So what size are your clam stakes? 
JC: 16-18 feet long... 
In 
three or four years this (cedar growing up) will make good clam 
stakes. 
They'll grow faster too, now that they can get air (on 
benefits of thinning or periodic cutting of cedar) and sunlight. 
EH: How many years to grow large enough for clam stakes? 
JC: 
About 20, 25 years. 
See, they're just the size now that they'll 
grow fast. 
And by cutting a lot of that bigger stuff out, 
... 
EH: What kind of a bottom is 
"spong," does anybody use that term 
around here? 
JC: A "spong" (pronounced "spung") 
is a low piece 
of swamp that works out towards the upland. You notice that, on 
the west side of the swamp there are quite a few spongs. 
EH: Are 
they kind of open? 
JC: They're kind of open. 
No, this 
is the 
main swamp here (not a spong), the main creek. 
A spong 
is a 
branch of the swamp. 
It's usually formed by a big hills off of 
the swamp area, and the valley as the years drained, the water 
drained, 
it causes that hollow. 
EH: Does a spong usually have a 
lot of sphagnum moss 
in 
it? 
JC: 
No. 
(unclear) 
EH: Does this 
kind of stuff got a name? 
JC: Savannah grass. 
You'll find it on 
the upland, acres and acres of 
it (Indicating possibly a Scirpus 
species:EH). 
It's called "savannah bottom" because it's covered 
with grass like that and little crippled pine about that high 
scattered here, that's about all 
you see there. 
(speculating 
that that "savannah grass" was used to make paper, 
like salt hay) 
(unclear) 
EH: Do inspectors from the Pinelands Commission come out and 
check up on you? 
JC: Yeah, they come around and check. 
EH: Do 
they know anything about the woods? 
JC: They know the woods, but 
they don't know the operation of 
it. 
As I said before, the guy 
cuts some fireplace wood out of there and they seen the remains 
there and they thought I was going to 
leave 
it. 
They didn't ask 
me or nothing. 
Sent word down to stop work on 
it. 
EH: Here are 
some acorns on this one; 
is 
it pin oak or black oak? 
JC: That's 
your black oak. 
That's black oak. 
(Indicating Quercus 
velutinus, black oak.) 
Turkey Oak 
is next after swamp maple (as 
best fire wood). 
EH: Is this little brush here (Gaylussacia sp. 
or Vaccinium sp.) your upland berry? 
JC: Yeah, thems the 
huckleberry, the round, black ones. 
Real seedy; nobody bothers 
with them. 
(probably Gaylussacia baccata:EH) 
If I go out into 
the woods to get huckleberries, I go after the swamp blues (not 
the upland stuff). 
EH: 
Is this hair grass again? 
JC: Yes, 
it'll 
only grow where man has disturbed the ground. 
EH: What does a 
Hunn -84 Audiocassette logs 
page 111 
"sand bottom" 
look like? What grows on a sand bottom? 
JC: You 
take, down 
in the Plains, there's hills there, that if you drive 
up there with a car, you get stuck in em. 
That's "sugar sand." 
That's called "sugar sand bottom." 
EH: So you get little dwarf 
pines growing there? 
JC: Yeah, and they don't grow too high. 
No 
moisture and no food there much. 
And 
if 
it does rain it goes on 
down because it's so sandy. 
(Sand bottom and trouble travelling 
roads.) 
Now before they improved Tuckerton Rd., the sand bottom 
between my house and, there's three hills below my house goin' 
to 
Tuckerton and two of 
'em's sugar sand. 
So an automobile or even 
in horse and wagon days, they'd never go to Tuckerton on account 
of that. They'd cut right down 
in that sugar sand, of sand 
bottom. And you'll find pieces of 
it 
in different old roads 
through the woods. 
EH: 
It could be dangerous if you got stuck 
in 
it? 
JC: Yeah, 
it's bad a clay bottom. 
It dries like concrete. 
Gets wet and 
its like mud. 
Go right down to the axel. 
EH: So 
what grows on clay bottom? 
JC: Savannah grass, that's all, and a 
few dwarf pieces of brush, that's all. 
EH: There's not much 
worth collecting there 
in savannah bottom? 
JC: 
No, year's ago I 
don't know what happened to them, but there was a huckleberry 
called "grouse berry." 
And, when I was a young fella we used to 
go down 
in them savannah bottom where the area'd be black with 
grouse berries. 
What happened to 
'em? 
You can't hardly find 
them (anymore). 
I don't know if 
it's the fires that killed them, 
but you had fires years ago the same as they did now, but you 
couldn't go out and find grouseberries anymore. 
EH: Was this grouseberry good like the swamp blue? 
JC: No, 
it had a taste of 
its own. 
And on the bottom (of the fruit) 
it 
had a ribbon around there that the others don't have,. and 
it 
growed in clusters. 
And 
it groomed only on brush that high. 
I 
have scoops at home that we used to hit the huck, pretty well 
shattered but we make our own scoops to bang. 
The scoop was 
rounded and with a rim onto it and you bang into the bush and the 
berries'd all 
fall 
into the scoop. 
Yeah, that's what we used to 
here, and we'd have the women... We'd scoop the berries and bring 
'em 
in, 
and the women would sort 'em and cup (?) 
'em up. 
EH: So 
(there's) grouseberry and your big swamp blues. 
JC: The bird 
called the grouse, you know what that is. 
They used to feed on 
them. 
Why they call 
it the grouseberry. 
EH: Do you have grouse 
around here? 
JC: 
Yeah, plenty of grouse, yeah. 
EH; Do you hunt 
them. 
JC: 
I used to but I'm not fast enough now. 
Now I 
wouldn't even try. 
You got to be fast. 
There good eatin', 
That's the best eatin' bird 
in the woods. 
I'd rather have that 
than a pheasant, that is 
if I were to have a choice between a 
grouse and a pheasant, 
I'd take a grouse anytime. 
Yessir. 
EH; 
Are there bobwhite quail 
in here? 
JC: We have a lot of coveys of 
quail here, but us boys 
in Warren Grove, we made a resolution, an 
agreement between us, about 20 years ago, that we wouldn't kill a 
quail. 
And we haven't since then. 
I have 'em right around my 
house. 
EH: Why was that? 
JC: 
Well, they were gettin' extinct. 
Whitey and 
I, 
fella I worked with me for about 35 years, had a 
heart attack here about 5 years ago, never come out of 
it. 
We 
were crazy about hunting, we always had our guns. 
We'd stop 
there just before you get to my house on the right hand side, a 
Hunn—$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 112 
covey of quail. 
Doggone if we didn't both get out there and we 
fired into them, emptied our guns... got every last one of them 
except two cripplers. 
Fella from Tuckerton just happened to come 
along with a dog and said, "What the hell are you guys doin'?" 
And I said, "Oh, we're just gettin' a couple of birds." He said, 
hey Chet--his name's Chet Driscoll--Chet, take your dog out here. 
There's a couple of cripplers in here, 
let your dog go get 'em, 
and he got 'em! 
After that I like to see around the house. 
I 
feed 'em now all winter. 
We got a couple of young boys that 
kill 
'em, that shoot into 
'em. They're around the cranberry bog 
where I got the bean poles. 
In there, 
is a nice covey. 
EH: Do 
you know a berry called a pillberry or a pinberry? 
JC: Bell 
berry, or bilberry? 
It's the latest berry we have, 
it ripens up 
in August, 
it's a big blue berry, and 
it's much larger than the 
others, and it's got a big seed in 
it, 
and it's got a taste of 
its own.

A quick recap. 
Definition of Pine barrens: stream flow 
patterns. 
Pine Barrens streams flow into the Atlantic or 
Delaware Bay; nonPine Barrens streams drain into middle Delaware 
R., Raritan Bay, or Upper Delaware R. 
This due 
in part to 
topography; due to NESW trending ridge in the western part of the 
state, 
in part also due to sub—surface geology affecting what is 
and what isn't the Pine Barrens. 
Stop at "G—Wading River; 15GT Bridge" (aka Evans Bridge over 
W. Branch Wading River on SR563): THE Wading River bridge is now 
under reconstruction. (on 542) 
For me this 
is the "Wading River 
Bridge" because road 563 from Green Bank heading up to Chatsworth 
is THE major highway of the Pine Barrens and here 
is where it 
crosses the Wading River. 
Describing Wading River bridge stop. 
A diversity of wild 
flowers there in a small area. 
Has long been a mowed roadside 
thus has good variety of the species that require a damp soil, 
not bog conditions, but damp all 
year, plus plenty of sunlight. 
There's pyxie in there, sand myrtle (Leiophyllum), Gentiana 
autumnalis (Pine Barrens gentian), we just saw winter leaves of 
Polygala lutea, (now right toward Harrisville). 
We saw 
Lycopodium alopecuroides (the foxtailed Clubmoss) indicating it's 
a damp area all 
year round, plus interesting things like Scleria 
minor (the small—fruited nut—rush), 
a relatively uncommon or 
rare species in the area (Cyperaceae). 
Also 
in stream there you 
find goldcrest, one of the nice endemic sort of things. 
Q: which 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 114 
tree? A: Red maples with bark pale splotchy with lichens (note 
they are on north side of tree). 
Bearberry noted along roadside 
in passing, but we'll see it 
in 
the Plains (that's Arctostaphylos). 
Also a couple of 
Habenarias, H. cristata, H. brevariaglottus (?) (still speaking 
of Wading River stop). 
It's a nice, 
little spot right beside the 
road. 
Nice for tour groups, 
if there are older people, they 
don't need to go very far. 
It's so busy there's little chance 
for people to dig out orchids (re. problem of plant collectors). 
Return to general characterization of Pine Barrens. 
Talked 
of the ridge tending from roughly Sandy Hook area to Delaware 
Memorial bridge, sort of a small continental divide. 
The soils 
are mainly glauconite greensands (west of divide) Eocene & 
Cretaceous age, rich 
in nutrients, high 
in phosphates and iron. 
TX02: This is the G-Harrisville; 26GT stop. 
We'll get a nice 
sample of spring water, a must with tour groups I bring 
in here 
in July and August. 
Well has been here over 100 years now, water 
is always flowing, always about 52 degrees, and you can see the 
nice iron color flowing out of 
it, 
the bog iron (note deposit on 
pipe mouth. 
Reddish color is deposited on 
it, 
iron precipitates 
on exposure to air. 
And there's the wall, patched a bit here and 
there. 
This was the Harris' bros. paper mill, like rice paper, 
from basic material of Spartina off the salt marshes of 
Tuckerton. 
They chose this location because dam in place at 
existing mill with water works needed for power. 
A nifty area, 
Harrisville. 
Identified wax myrtle, not bayberry (they're 
different). 
A town here at one time. 
Vegetation indicates 
that: 
it's not a Pine Barren. 
Red cedar indicates that, also 
catalpa trees (eerie at night, especially if you go to Martha but 
now need a better car. 
Interesting plants: Chrysopsis falcata 
(sickle-leaved golden aster) which 
is native Mass. to NJ. 
This 
is one of few locations for it 
in 
the state. 
Needs dry sandy 
soils and lots of sunlight, due to all 
the old fields right 
around here at Harrisville. 
And here's Polyginella 
articulata 
(the sand joint-weed), a knot-weed. 
You also find Monarda 
punctata, the horse mint, here. 
The first city ever lit by 
gaslights. 
The pipes from Batsto, gas collecting station 
collecting methane gas from swamp gas. 
This 
is wax myrtle, resin 
dots only on 
lower surface of 
leaves, whichever one that is. 
I 
lead bird groups, botany groups, or just a few people from out of 
state who come up and want to see the Pine Barrens. 
This 
is the 
one stop everybody sees pictures of, a must stop. 
(Identified a 
woodcock that just flushed from underfoot.) 
It might even be 
nesting right here; one of the common nesting shorebirds of pine 
barrens; start courting in 
late January. 
To hear them at night, 
find a nice field like near Batsto, go there at dusk. 
But we 
come here looking for odd plants. 
Walls built out of 
ironstone. 
Got lime from seashells to make their own mortar. 
The lime 
is 
contradiction in acidic pine barrens soil. 
So you find here the 
Maiden-hair Spleenwort, an evergreen fern, a limestone cliff type 
fern, and perhaps a Woodsia (fern). 
Let's not hop the fence 
today. 
When I was younger there was no fence here, but too many 
people are into collecting artifacts 
Also the wall 
is a bit of 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 115 
a hazard. 
So 
in this limestone wall you see non—native species 
which spread here naturally, for example, nobody in their right 
mind would intentionally introduce a maiden—hair spleenwort, 
rather the spores blew in here on the wind from the Appalachians. 
You also find a nifty orchid, the fen orchid (Liparis loeselli), 
loesel's Twayblade, found here and around other old city sites 
with limey soils. 
Q: When do first recall coming out here to Harrisville? 
A: 
In the 50's, my father brought me out here. 
There's one of the 
weedy things, the moth mullein. 
Another sign of civilization in 
here, of course, 
is the poison ivy. 
Oh that's one of the 
clovers, a Lespedeza, one of the bush clovers (identification for 
tiny trifoliate leaves just appearing). 
When you look for odd 
plants, you look first for odd habitats. 
That's one reason to 
come to Harrisville. 
You got all 
this lime 
in the soil. 
You go 
to Martha because you've got this old lake bed. 
It floods often 
enough that the trees don't come in, but stays open enough that 
you've got a lot of bog plants growing in 
it. 
And you look 
along road shoulders because they are always mowed: that's an odd 
habitat to have an open natural field. 
See right here, one of 
the natural things about the Pine Barrens, what do you see? 
Sands, talking about soil types. 
Go on 
into one of these areas 
that's nicely grown over: you know plants have been growing there 
for years, though there's no soil 
to speak of, though you might 
see a darkening of the soil for the top few inches. 
If you did 
an analysis though you'd find no phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen. 
A soilless area. 
There's no A—zone. 
There's no A—type soil 
occurring in most of the uplands. 
The other extreme is what you 
find 
in the cedar bottoms, that are all 
humus with no minerals. 
Almost nothing for a plant to grab onto, 
it's like growing in a 
compost heap, no nitrogen, extreme nitrogen poor soils, and 
nitrogen is exceptional for stem and leaf growth. 
Definition of 
compost heap 
is pure humus, almost no nitrogen. 
Q: Why acidic soil 
in the Pine Barrens? 
A: There are no 
buffers 
in the soil. 
In west Jersey you've got green sands full 
of shell materials plus natural feldspar minerals, glauconite, 
etc., and with lots of clays it absorbs the acid materials. 
They 
buffer it. 
If you take the soil 
and mix 
it with water it may 
have a natural ph of about 8. 
Drop rainfall with ph of 5 on 
it 
the result is near neutral (ph=7:EH). 
In this area you start 
with very pure, weathered sand, having residuals like quartz and 
heavily minerals like titanium oxide, elmenite, ruilite, maybe 
tourmalines, things that don't dissolve. 
The sands here already 
so heavily leached by atmospheric waters, there's nothing left to 
buffer additional rainfall. 
Don't store your egg there too long 
(in this acid water, rain) the shells will just dissolve away. 
To top it off, there's added ph from organic acids from pine 
needles, tanic acids from oaks, plus acid rain with nothing to 
buffer it. 
So you've got extremely acid water, nothing to buffer 
it, a natural area with no nitrogen, phosphate. So you start here 
with something that no plant likes. 
Pinelands sits on top of 
younger sands, Miocene and younger. 
All highly weathered. 
Three 
hundred feet of sand with no buffering. 
In West Jersey you're 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 116 
talking about in weathered areas maybe a foot or two of sand, and 
then maybe a hundred feet of glauconite greensands. 
So almost 
any natural percolation brings nutrients up to growing surfaces 
of plants. 
That's why the great distinction between East Jersey 
and West Jersey in the southern part of the state. 
West Jersey's 
got that nice rich woodland floras, hickories, walnuts, beech 
trees, not just riparian, even all 
the uplands too, nice rich 
hardwoods. 
The under—story has things like showy orchid, Orchis 
spectabilis, 
it's not common but it's there. 
It's absent from 
the Pine Barrens. 
TX03: Now we're coming to Hog Wallow, Jenkins Neck, Duke's 
Bridge, G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
Jack—in—the—pulpit (returning to 
description of West Jersey under—story flora contrasts), 
in 
stream bottoms you find Caltha palustris, the marsh marigold. 
You did get a small fringing pine barrens area along the Atlantic 
coast. 
Q: Ah, an abandoned blueberry field, would you get 
anything much 
in 
it? 
A: No, 
it's too young for native species to 
have gotten in. 
Once again, 
it's a matter of age (aside on 
island biogeography theory) 
EH: Mick's Canoe Rentals. 
Jim 
Stasz: 
When I was young there were no canoe rentals; today there 
are too many canoe rentals. 
(aside on robin's tail pattern) 
Our 
breeding robins are black—capped with gray backs, northern one's 
are capped with almost green backs. 
Delaware River pine barrens fringe described: 
running along 
old Eocene beach area. 
A pine woods, but almost pure Pinus 
virginiana with broom sedge growing among them (Andropogon). 
Impoverished flora, but with interesting bird distribution 
pattern, as 
it 
is the primary saw—whet owl wintering area. 
Some 
winter on the coastal barrier islands, but not in the Pine 
Barrens in between. 
Q: Any theories as to why? 
A: I have an 
extreme theory: that saw—whet owls evolved 35-40 million years 
ago, and they then wintered along (then existent) coastline. 
The 
coastline moved, but the birds wintering distribution did not. 
(this theory no doubt controversial) 
We're now coming up on the agricultural giants of the 
pinelands: hog wallow—friendship bogs area. 
Q:Crows, what kind? 
We were looking at cranberry bog area, at an area where flooding 
had killed off all 
the trees, 10-12" 
in diameter, a good area for 
hole nesting species. 
Tree swallows, red—headed woodpeckers. Q: 
And bluebirds? 
A: This was a major wintering area for bluebirds, 
but April 
icestorm in the mid'50's froze all 
the berries (food 
supply for birds) and sealed birds in 
roosting boxes. 
Since then 
habitat destruction has prevented bluebirds from returning in 
numbers. 
Though I bet if you put bluebird boxes up all 
around 
these cranberry bogs they'd come back. 
Q: 
An old abandoned 
blueberry field, what birds there? 
A: Field sparrows, towhees, 
chats, but not this time of the year. 
This is a real 
dull time 
of the year. 
Nothing has really arrived, wintering species are 
few. 
But now a good time to go out to 
listen for grouse drumming 
(noted rarity of our earlier sighting of three grouse by 
roadside). 
(Continuing north) Now this 
is area between Duke's Bridge 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 117 
and Chatsworth that is 
(real) Pine Barrens, no houses. 
(aside 
discussion of sedge bottoms) 
Some of these (bog areas) are 
extensive Carex walteriana 
END SIDE ONE. 
BEGIN SIDE TWO. 
The population has dropped considerably in the last 100 
years. 
You see all 
these names on the maps of places that no 
longer exist. 
But I have maps dating back to about 1830 and the 
roads on those maps are the same as on maps today. 
Those old 
roads still exist, they get traveled often enough, that with 4— 
wheel drive you can get through. 
Without that continuous travel, 
in just 10 years you might get a pine through the roadway that 
would prevent passage, but it would take maybe several hundred 
years for all 
signs of the road to disappear. 
Even walking through an area you can find where the old 
roads used to be. 
It's easy to find where the old towns were 
because you look for the odd plants. 
We suddenly went through a change, going east from 
Chatsworth (on 532). Now this 
is an old burn area, hit by the big 
Chatsworth fire (the pines are only about 20 feet high) of the 
'60's. 
It had a crown fire with exploding trees. 
Most of these 
pines are about 20 years old, a few older. 
But this area was 
burnt flat. 
This 
is still one of the high frequency burn areas. 
We've 
got the shore road, highway 70, 
running through to the 
north, 
Of course people come along, drop a cigarette butt out of 
the car, and bang. 
Now, this area (a bit further along) was 
burnt two years ago. 
(not a dwarf pine plain are) 
Those taller 
snags 
in the back probably date from the Chatsworth fire (of the 
'60's). Note in this are the fire was so hot there's nothing 
above 10 feet high. 
It was such a hot fire it just stripped 
everything. 
They're coming up. 
In the back are some 30 foot 
pines still sticking up or remnants of such (thus it's not true 
plains). 
Q: Any unusual plants appear after a fire like that? 
A: No, but you get some nice birds like Common Nighthawk nesting, 
which need open area. 
Common Nighthawk has actually been decline 
with fire suppression, but this is still one of the best areas; 
also good areas are urban areas with gravel topped roofs and 
beach areas. 
Rockefeller Highway (US70). 
You could drive it with your 
eyes closed. 
Come up here to 
look for turkey beard, bearberry's 
a little bit more common, and along rte 70 here are a few old 
bogs where you might find red—headed woodpeckers nesting. 
But 
you're heading east and 
if you'd been driving east all 
the way 
from the Philadelphia area, one thing you'd notice 
is how flat it 
is, 
and suddenly up ahead 
is a hill. 
It's quite a shock. 
That's 
a sign you're just about to hit the plains, the west plains area. 
Right now we've got normal sized (almost) pitch pines 25-30 feet 
tall, even though it's been burned. 
And 
it 
is actually 
pretty 
easy walking under the pines. 
But out on the plains, 
if you 
don't follow a trail you'll struggle every inch of the way. 
Q: 
Why 
is the transition (to the plains) so abrupt? 
(as at mile 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 118 
post 10 on SR70) 
Does it date back to some giant fire? 
A: Now 
your're getting back to the origin of the plains. 
It 
is sudden. 
That's an observation you can make, but as to figuring out 
exactly why, people have been working on that for years. 
Some of 
the experts that have come in hear say the soil doesn't have 
enough aluminum, others that it has too much aluminum. 
One says 
fires are too common, another study shows that fires are no more 
common on the plains than anywhere else. 
TX04: We'll turn off up ahead opposite the old road to red oak 
grove down to G—Oswego; 56GT. 
We call 
it the Oswego turnpike, 
because it's really a major sand road. 
It's almost four cars 
wide! 
And hard packed. 
It 
is one of the major non—paved roads 
of the pinelands. 
But look at the pines here, 
it's all 
short, 
bearberry covering the ground. 
A nice variety of oaks, plus 
hybrids too. 
Oaks include post oak, blackjack oak, some white 
oaks, some chestnuts (oaks), some dwarf chestnut, bear oak 
(ilicifolia), also found in Maryland on well drained, gravelly 
soils. 
Post oak just about everywhere along with white oak. 
White oak maybe 
in slightly damper conditions. 
Just opposite the 
store up here we'll turn right. 
Oswego parkway, Plains parkway, 
takes you on down to Oswego Lake. 
But there's a maze of roads 
in 
Penn state Park and none of them have signs. 
They were paved 
during the depression and since then have worn away so sometimes 
you're on paved road, sometimes on sand, usually on cratered 
road. 
I brought a group up here 
in October in a chartered bus... 
Q: 
Is this sugar sand? 
A: No, 
it's not sugar sand. 
Sugar sand's 
got the texture of sugar; 
it's like driving in powdered snow. 
This 
is actually a very hard sand. 
Sugar sand is very deep and 
very loose, 
like powder snow. 
You don't get it much on the 
Plains, on the plains it's hard packed, very gravelly. 
Sugar 
sand occurs throughout the Pine Barrens, and it's getting more 
common due to four wheel drive vehicles. 
Right now we're doing 
the great hunt for Corema conradii, Conrad's crowberry. 
A native 
of the tundra and the arctic. 
Q: 
The very first native spring 
flower? 
A: Yes, and hitting its southernmost distribution. 
Well, the first with a somewhat showy flower. 
We want to go on 
down the road to the highest spot on the road. 
Q: 
What's the 
highest point in the Pines? 
A: 
Don't know exactly, 100 feet? 
108' comes to mind. 
And here's where we want to stop, right 
about here. 
There's been so much written and said about the Plains that 
I can't add anything to 
it, except that nobody's explained why 
it's the plains, but it certainly is different, a completely 
different experience. 
I've done extensive travelling across the 
country... There's nothing that looks like this. 
We just decided 
not to go to Webb's Mills, a stop to save for later in the year. 
It 
is a fairly accessible, open bog situation. 
You walk on out 
there and there's several 
inches of the typical acid muck, of 
black sticky goo that gets all 
over your sneakers. 
It's very 
open, you're talking about pockets of vegetation maybe two feet 
tall 
and areas of just barren sand, a it's all a big spring 
zone. 
Curly grass fern 
is 
in there, three species of sundews, 
Arethusa bulbosa, the dragon orchid, 
that'll 
be out, the last one's 
in mid—June, 
it's a Memorial 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 119 
weekend bloomer. 
Then later on 
in 
the year bog asphodel and lots 
of pretty endemic Pine Barrens bog plants. It's right next to the 
road and 
several years ago a group built a board walk, and 
people use 
it rather than buck through the bog and churn 
everything up. 
I have no 
idea who built the boardwalk but it's 
something that should be maintained. 
It's now state land. 
It's 
off of Route 539. 
TX05: G-Manahawkin Woods; 56GT was one of the early preservation 
Green Acres program. 
It was discovered 
efforts of the New Jersey 
covered 
I believe by Dave Fables, 
botanist, herpetologist, 
ecker.) 
y, 
an all 
around naturalist 
Dave was from North Jersey, 
Iso 
knew the insects. 
He pas 
a found

and 
that caused quite a stir,

Black-throated Green, whi

have 
gone out and started look

it 
in many white 
Pine 
discovery 
TX08: Oceanville bog, 
it's own Great Bay Rd., about 1/4 mile west 
of the town of G—Oceanville; 09GT. 
A favorite area for many groups 
to stop because in a small area just off the road 
is a high 
diversity of typical bog plants found in more interior, 
less 
accessible Pine Barrens bogs. 
On the north side of the road a 
nice pond with water lilies, purple bladderworts, fringed on 
its 
east side by a quaking sphagnum mat sometimes fun to walk out on. 
On the south side of the road 
is a stunted cedar swamp with open 
bare patches and thin sheets of mud on top of sand plus the 
typical thicker humus deposits. 
So 
it's got a lot of variety of 
different habitats, and one of the big features is that there is 
really no solid upper story, no shading, so once again you get a 
spring fed boggy area with no canopy to shade out a lot of the 
more unusual species. 
This area is currently... the Nature 
Conservancy is trying to purchase the 
land 
in the area. 
I 
believe they will easily be able to acquire the north side of the 
area from a local developer, since he knows that he can't develop 
due to the springs being right in that location. 
The south side 
of the road belongs to several different owners, so negotiations 
will 
be a little more difficult there. 
The spring area is also 
somewhat important to Brigantine Refuge because 
it 
is part of 
the short but very small watershed area of Dowdy Creek which 
feeds fresh water into the refuge water system. 
It's important 
to try to keep that clean.. 
One of the more interesting mammals 
found in the area at 
lily 
lake and along Dowdy Creek that you can 
see right from Route 9 is the River Otter, which is not a very 
common species anymore in the state. 
The plants 
in the bog are 
the real highlight with curly grass fern, Lycopodium 
carolinianum, the Carolina clubmoss. There are at least a half 
dozen species of the bog orchids, 
including Arethusa, Rose 
Pogonia, Calopogon, Habenaria blepharioglottus, Habenaria 
cristata, and Habenaria clavulata. 
Another interesting thing is 
that in the early 1950's a scientist was examining the hardiness 
of the Venus Flytrap, so he transplanted it --a number of 
individuals--from North Carolina to Oceanville Bog, and just 
today we saw one of the very few survivors. 
For a number of 
years they were breeding, they were flowering freely and 
producing viable seed and spreading, but apparently in recent 
years collec ors have come in 
and started to extirpate a very 
unusual 
introduced species. 
Just the one plant apparently is 
surviving. 
The other species are surviving; there's very little 
signs of digging. 
Not many people go wandering around through 
the bog. 
They restrict themselves to the one trail at the east 
end of the bog, and just go 
in about 50 feet or so and then turn 
around. 
And just from that access point and just from alongside 
the road you can see many, many of the species of the New Jersey 
Pine Barrens bogs, that's why it's so popular. 
It's such an 
accessible spot. 
I recall one time showing people purple 
bladderwort through my telescope. 
You could set it up on the 
side of the road and focus in on the flower that was out in the 
pond. 
TX09: Heading back route 561 from the Oceanvi Ile area toward 
Hammonton, we pass south of the old Egg Harbor race track area 
where G—Camp Kilmer; 12GT was located during World War II. 
The 
only real 
interest in that area is that a lot of the old masonry 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 121 
works for the buildings had fallen down and provided habitat for 
pine snakes and skinks and fence lizards. 
It's a place that 
perhaps too many of the 
local herpetologists know about, but it's 
one of the few reliable area where you can go and reasonably 
expect to still find both skinks and pine snakes. 
We just passed 
the Camp Kilmer area and 
it's north of 561 and just a little bit 
west of the town of Elwood.

That one there with the corrugated bark 
in the back, I think 
it 
looks like a sassafras. 
It think it's just a blackbird flying 
by. 
I hear an amphibian calling in the back there. 
Right now 
it kind of dull 
in terms of bird life, a few residents are still 
around, and we just had a nice flock of fox sparrows (migrants). 
But in breeding season this 
is got sort of stagnant water pools 
sitting 
in 
it, without a flowing stream, so 
it's not quite right 
for Prothonotary Warblers and you don't find them nesting right 
at this spot. 
But 
you do find things that like the thick 
understory and the wet conditions like Hooded Warbler. 
And 
towards the fringes where it's not so wet underneath but still 
nice and thick and on the damp side, Kentucky Warblers will nest 
along 
in here. 
This 
is a little bit damp for catbirds, but 
Louisiana Waterthrushes... 
You can see right here 
in this 
stream,... we're so far up here in 
the headwaters,... and this 
is 
slightly different,... 
it doesn't have quite the tannic acid, 
it's not quite the coffee color you expect from a Pine Barrens 
stream. 
(There's a woodpecker working.) 
Right now it's the 
season for all 
the woodpeckers to be getting to work and nesting. 
Acadian flycatcher nests 
in here, and when you get into the dryer 
parts of the woods you start picking up the more typical Pine 
Barrens things like Blue—winged Warbler, Pine Warbler, Prairie 
Warbler, Ovenbirds, towhees. 
In the field and scrub areas Brown 
Thrasher and maybe an occasional chat, Indigo Bunting, Great 
Crested Flycatcher, and this 
is one area since it's toward the 
west end of New Jersey, you pick up a few more unusual things, 
probably the most common being the Worm—eating Warbler. 
Which is 
not really common throughout the pine barrens itself. 
We're sort 
of 
in the southeastern part of the range for this species. 
It 
occurs in a big island, cypress swamp sort of habitat in the 
Delmarva Peninsula, a very isolated occurrence. 
Normally you 
associate it with piedmont hillsides with scrubby oaks on a dry, 
rain shadow side of a hill. 
Swainsons Warbler has been recorded 
only about three times 
in the state, all definitely migrants. 
Right here we just changed the elevation a few feet and the 
whole character starts changing. 
Green briar starts 
disappearing, though it 
is still nice and thick and shrubby with 
shad bushes and clethra. 
It's one of the shads here; 
look at 
the pattern of the branches; 
it gives a sort of a hawthorn sort 
of appearance to 
it. 
Picking up some bracken ferns, 
little bits 
of fronds still sticking up, hung up 
in the limbs. 
(sound of 
"pishing" to attract birds) 
Red—breasts (nuthatches). 
Just a 
few miles southwest of here 
is a heronry, exclusively Great 
Blues, and I think last year there were 53 nests in 
it. 
A little 
patch of woods surrounded by farm fields. 
Now you get an 
idea 
why they sometimes call 
it yellow pine (a tall Pinus echinata 
showing yellowish red bark on higher portions of trunk). 
Here's a pitch (pine) and right over here Virginia 
(pine). 
Sweet gum showing corrugated cork like on branches (Liquidamber). 
The problem with Nyssa, you probably get two species 
in here, but 
they are very hard to distinguish, that's my experience with 
them. 
Nyssa aquatica is the more southern, the one called 
tupelo. 
(and Nyssa sylvatica, the sourgum, or black gum).

Juncus (junco) singing; goldfinch. 
No. 
Pine Warblers 
pretty much move out (in winter), only a few old males stay 
around. 
But by this time of year there should be a few singing, 
and I have seen nest building this early. 
Wood duck; wood duck's 
in already. 
They get back and get to nesting right away, they're 
one of the earliest ones. 
They don't have any boxes in here so 
they're all nesting 
in natural cavities (wood ducks). 
I remember 
seeing one back 
in here pop out of a cavity about 40 feet up 
in a 
tree. 
A strange sight to see a duck pop out of a tree. 
You really have to hunt around here to find the little 
patches; there are a few ponds indicated on the topo maps but 
aren't obvious from the road. 
But if you hike on 
in you find 
sundews, pitcher plants scattered through, gold club (Orontium 
aquaticum), which is sort of a Pine Barrens pond sort of thing. 
Q: 
So all 
of these things indicate to you that you're still 
in 
the Pines? 
A: Yeah, 
in fact later on we'll see a nice patch of 
Atlantic White Cedar and nearby is an area with Helonias bullata, 
swamp hyacinth. 
That's one of the... Q: 
Is there any white cedar 
at all along the Delaware? 
A: 
There a few scattered locations 
in some of the swamplands along the river, but nothing you could 
call a cedar stand; more like isolated trees. 
This was probably 
the dominant forest type all 
the way across (to connect with 
contemporary pine barrens, prior to colonization). 
This 
is a big hunting area; state of New Jersey state 
hunting and fishing area. 
Q: What are they after? 
A: Deer, I 
don't know if 
the do woodcock in here; small game would include 
such things as squirrel, maybe grouse. 
(Listening to chickadee 
song.) 
This time of year as you drive on through you can 
actually look back into the woods 50-60 feet, but when you come 
here 
in May you're in an area where 
if 
the bird isn't by the side 
of 
the road you don't see 
it. 
The understory is ten-15 feet high 
and very thick now, and that's just the twigs we're seeing, so 
when 
it all 
leafs out it forms a very dark, deciduous woods. 
Birch is 
an early succession (growth) and they don't live 
long; 
and of course its a bit damp under here or the birch wouldn't be 
here at all. 
In terms of the water table, the high spot in the forest is 
probably only 10 or 12 feet above the water table. 
Then there 
are great tracks at or just inches above the water table, so with 
the heavy rains you get these tree islands, where each tree 
is 
an 
island. 
(Discussion of cedar growing on hassocks in marshes.) 
Here's a different variety of transect; this 
is a gas 
line that's 
cut through, and they keep it clear. 
So you get these swales, 
(swaths?) these nice straight patches that go through different 
elevations, but they keep 
it mowed so you get once again the open 
wet meadows and open dryland effects, so you get a lot of habitat 
variation. 
You get different plants than you would see 
in 
the 
woods otherwise. 
The other thing 
is you get an access path 
through these generally inaccessible woods; so you walk along the 
edges of these things and look into... you get more perimeter of 
woods to 
look 
into. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 125 
There's a couple of Mallards in the back. 
This 
is one of 
the typical 
little ponds you find 
in the forest. 
This ones got 
nice white cedars by 
it. 
Leatherleaf coming all 
around the 
shore. 
And there's Clethra. 
But here the water does certainly 
look more tea colored. (Discussion of winter shrub 
identification.) 
The leatherleaf, yeah, when we get back to New 
Brooklyn we'll see there's a big area (of it) down there. 
It's a 
typically northern species, Leatherleaf. 
A red squirrel just 
ran across the road, back into the woods. 
I don't see any signs 
of the gold club as yet, 
(it grows) right out of the water. 
You 
might see some hiding back in the edges. 
Look how thick the Ilex 
is 
right here. 
(Discussion of Maryland forest structure and role 
of Ilex opaca.) 
You've got to remember only the female trees 
will have berries (thus the apparent scarcity of holly trees with 
fruit) 
Leatherleaf once again, Decodon cristata, once again. 
Starting to fill 
in this once open area. 
Decodon flowers all 
occur in whorls, 
it a July sort of flower, lavender purple. 
One thing we haven't noticed is weeds. 
Where is the 
dandelions, the honeysuckles. 
One thing about the Pine Barrens 
is that it's so harsh in terms of 
its environment that weeds 
won't grow there, unless you've really come to a disturbed area 
that's really changed its character, you don't find 
weeds. 
So 
that's a way of 
locating old house sites, old villages. 
Andropogon (grass) 
is a native (not a weed). 
As the maples get older they get these vertical, 
long 
stringy, 
it gets sort of corrugated in a way, but when it's fresh 
and young they're nice and smooth and gray, kind of like a beech. 
(In the Pine Barrens) you find just the one (species) of maple, 
You really have to move up into the mountain areas to pick up 
more than one or into suburbia where you start finding lots. 
We've just stopped at the Helonias bullata location, and one 
things always intrigued me, 
is that I've talked to other field 
botanists, and they all 
seem to think that Helonias needs 
sunlight. 
But I've always found it thriving here 
in these very 
thick woods. 
This is supposedly fairly common throughout the 
Pine Barrens 
in the cedar swamps, but I've never run across it. 
I've only found 
it 
in this one patch of woods. 
Right now this 
is 
a candidate for the federal endangered species list because it's 
been extirpated in much of 
its range. 
I don't know if 
it was 
extirpated in the pines or if 
it just naturally vanished. 
As I 
understand it, 
it grows in places where people don't like to go, 
and 
it certainly doesn't seem to be... short breeding season... 
it's got pink flowers with blue stamens with yellow pollen and 
extremely aromatic. 
The (stamens) are sort of baby blue, and 
since its extremely aromatic, when 
it blooms you know it. 
I 
don't think it's a matter of people digging it up and moving it 
out. 
If 
it occurs in these big cedar stands, there're so many 
cedar stands, 
it doesn't seem like 
it could be due to habitat 
destruction. EH: It may never have been that common. JS: That's a 
possibility. 
Everybody learned about those (few) locations, and 
so 
it was common knowledge. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 126 
Back 
in December I mentioned the southern type hardwood; 
that's the character of a large part of Glassboro woods. 
It's a 
southern coastal plain hardwoods, so it's got a very rich 
diversity of birds. 
It's still got a lot of the typical Pine 
Barrens flora, but the ratios are all 
switched around. 
There's 
not much cedar, but there're at least a few pockets of the denser 
stands of cedar. 
The tulip tree 
is a southern species; you won't 
find that in a cedar swamp. 
As you head on down the Maurice 
River system, 
it begins to seem more and more like a typical 
pinelands area 
in which you do get extensive cedar swamps 
bordering the creeks, but it occasionally opens out into the 
southern type hardwood. 
The Maurice River is the most western of 
the Pinelands drainages.

None of which 
olerant. 
You start seeing things like Mirey Run, and 
which indicates that many of these ponds were once marl 
they used to mine the phosphate and potassium rich 
for fertilizer. 
Another change is the ground starts 
re, 
it's no longer just a nice flat plain, as you head 
e further west it just rolls and gives a little more 
the topography. 
And of course with all 
the vegetation 
ere's a big change 
in the bird life. 
This 
is one of

The stream valleys are very steep sided, almost vertical 
because of undercutting. 
The woods have remained (as a result). 
The upland areas are all 
open fields, but then the stream 
corridors are very mature--all second growth wood, there's 
nothing resembling a virgin forest around here--but these long 
narrow corridors of mature woodland provides enough habitat for a 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 127 
lot of these nesting species. 
It 
is an interesting situation. 
Old Man's Creek starts inland and runs at least 15 miles with 
good woods to tidal flats, before emptying into the Delaware 
River. 
It was 
in this area the home of the 
last Bald Eagle 
nesting; 
in fact the tree still remains, and the character of the 
woods has not changed. 
If the eagles return to the area, they've 
still got a nesting site available. 
This was one of the last 12 (bald eagles nests) 
in south 
Jersey, the last surviving one 
is 
in Cumberland County. 
Discussion tree species occurring along the stream valleys in 
west Jersey. 
Often people in referring to tree species in Pine 
Barrens stream valley, they assume a white cedar type of swamp, a 
biased viewpoint. 
If you go down and look along some of these 
Pine Barrens rivers you will find these typical southern 
hardwoods flora. 
Since the white cedar swamp complex is the most 
common, you get a biased view (of the variety of species present 
in the area). 
For example, one might claim that this type of oak 
is 
rare 
in 
the Pine Barrens, but it may be quite common 
in 
the 
right sort of habitat (in the Pine Barrens region). 
You can see the Piedmont now across the Delaware River. 
That's the Fall Line. 
The river now parallels the front between 
the Piedmont and the coastal plain. 
So when you're in south 
Jersey you're always looking up to Pennsylvania.

TXOI: G—Warren Grove; 56GT That's the triple oak, that's my west— 
southwest corner of the track here, of the cedar swamp. 
It's 
marked with three dashes and a couple of carves. 
Those marks 
have been there since 1904, that I remember. 
They may have been 
there before that, but I don't know. 
There again 
is a tree that 
when I was 8-9 years old, the trees looked the same size to me 
then as they are now. 
A triple white oak. 
I always worry about 
the highway crew coming along, cutting it down. 
(indicating 
direction of Sims Place) 
And this 
is Beaver Dam Rd., originally 
built by beavers. 
The beavers had a crude dam across here years 
ago. 
(name of this place?) 
It's just Oswego, you see, Oswego 
comes down and 
it crossed Beaver Dam Rd. here, and there's the 
main stream up here where these pipes are. 
We passed one stream 
down here where the lake 
is, 
comes through. 
(explain about 
"branch") 
Now here's the main stream of the Oswego, 
it goes all 
the way to Oswego Lake through the Sim's Place and into Oswego 
Lake. 
From Oswego Lake it goes on down into the Wadin' River. 
It parallels 539 going out to 72 (toward the headwaters), 
it 
crosses the road before you get to 72 and goes up to an area 
called Howardville. 
And the head of this Oswego swamp is between 
two hills in Forked River mountains, and they called the head of 
it Coffin Board Hollow. 
I don't know why they call 
it that, but 
that's what it's called. 
This 
is the start of Oswego River, 
that's what it 
is. 
Q: What's a branch? 
A: 
It's the drainage 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 129 
basin of all 
the area. 
Every branch or every slough and any 
drainage of any other waterways around all flows into this. 
This 
is the main drainage basin for the whole area. 
Low branches 
where no water--other than when you have heavy rains, there might 
be a little water into 'em--but there's plants, food, that grouse 
likes 
in 
an area at that time, and also for protection. 
They go 
into those briars and they know they're pretty safe. 
We made 
deer drives, I know I've been on deer drives, where they drove a 
grouse out and he jumped right up and landed right in front of 
me. 
And I had the gun 
in my hand, you know, before I could 
straighten my gun out he disappeared. 
I don't know where he 
went, never seen him. 
Now this 
is a, when they first put this operation in here, 
they had diamonds with 90 foot poles with antennas representing 
different parts of the world, you know, and ... but since that 
time they've improved on equipment. 
Poles weren't necessary 
anymore. 
They have more sophisticated equipment to take care of 
that receiving stuff, you know (explaining a FAA installation in 
Penn State Forest near Warren Grove). 
So they done away with the 
poles and they found themselves with more property than they 
needed. 
So they --I don't know whether it's a regulation or what 
it 
is--the state has the first preference at taking up property 
that the government doesn't need anymore, that's what I 
understand. 
There's the installation there. 
FAA. 
They have 
three of them. 
They have one up here they call the Ship Bottom 
station. 
Up near 72. 
And then they have one up 
in the West 
Plains there. 
This 
is the main... 
That fella you just seen, he 
takes care of 
it. 
There's two technicians that take care of the 
equipment. 
We just crossed over from Ocean County to Burlington 
County now. 
That's part of the West Plains. 
That 
green stuff, 
yeah, that's "uversi." 
That's good for medicine. 
You turn right 
here and I'll 
show you... Now the state took the property over, 
but they had to 
limit themselves to a campground of 15 spaces. 
See here's one here, there's one there. 
They had tables here, a 
pump over there, a nice hand pump. 
Had fireplace boxes. 
That's 
where the pump was, right over there... 
Well first thing you 
know they busted the pump, or stole the pump, and don't know what 
it was. 
And then they would take and.... what I'm getting at is, 
that's what we're saving this stuff for, future destruction! 
Three Cranmer brothers, one was George Cranmer, 
lived just as you 
crossed Beaver Dam Rd., 
in the old house on the right, that's one 
of the oldest houses 
in Warren Grove. 
It was built around 1800. 
And John Cranmer had a place over here, and the other was over in 
Brookville. 
This fella settled here around 1790 or 1800. 
Raised 
18 children I understand. 
Used to be a house right here. 
Q:What's this grass right here? 
A: That's Indian Grass (Panicum 
sp., perhaps 
in error?:EH). 
We used to come over here and burn 
it. 
They had the house here, to protect the house. 
Now ... 
If 
you turn right you come out on 72, Stevenson Rd. 
That's going 
north. 
See where they steal cedar off me. 
They cut two or three 
trees down. 
They want you to 
leave a hundred feet (referring to 
required buffer along roadsides of county regulations:EH). 
All 
you're Join' 
is 
leavin' a hundred feet for the thieves. 
That's 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs

"blue bent," they call 
it blue bent, got th e tasse l 
on top . 
When it's growing it's kind of bluish (indicating Andropogon sp., 
perhaps 
in error?:EH). 
Oh that burns, oh does that burn! 
It 
makes a blue flame when 
it burns. 
Some of 
it grows along the 
edge of the fields; when 
it (a fire) hits that, 
it's a beautiful 
flame, but boy 
it goes up 
like gasoline. 
Now this 
is called Plain Branch, dumps into the Oswego at 
Sims Place. 
It all dumps in; here's the creek right here. 
And 
it flows into the Oswego and on down. 
Q:Who steals the cedar? A: 
These young fellas, they go and get half—a—cord of cedar, take 
it 
to the sawmill. 
... 
That's Indian Grass there (Panicum again?). 
Oh that one. 
That one's the same as the other, the blue bent 
(for a Scirpus sp.?:EH). 
I thought you meant this clump right 
here. 
Now this 
is 
as far as my property goes, down through here, 
there's my 
line there. 
Now there's a fella from Morristown, New Jersey, made 
himself a lake here and built a pretty nice place here. 
It's 
right in woods there. 
And he got everything out of building 
planks, beds, tables, ... 
and everything. 
... The brush in 
there're huckleberries, the 
low brush, they're the sweetest berry 
we have but nobody bothers with them anymore (=upland blue 
huckleberry:EH). 
Yeah, they have little seeds in em, 
but they're 
blue, they're really light blue color. 
Q: 
Is that what they cut 
for the brush ("sugar huck," cut for decorative use:EH). 
Yeah, 
for decorative purposes. 
The bilberry's something else, the 
bilberry's black. 
It has a decorative ribbon on the bottom (of 
the fruit), looks pretty. 
Has a taste of 
its own. 
There's 18 
different varieties of blueberries..of huckleberries in the 
woods, according to Hershberger (=Harshberger:EH). 
I've seen a 
good many. 
There's the big blues, the small blues, the big 
blacks, the small blacks, the medium blacks, medium blues, 
there's bilberry, grouseberry, the upland blue, and I believe 
there 
is 
(18 varieties). 
Then there's one has black berries, 
real small, and the whole bush'd be 
loaded with 'em, but the 
they'd be so small that no one even bothers with them today. 
(Noted failed tree, pitch pine 
in swampy ground) 
Oh yeah, 
it's 
wind blown. 
Excess water softened that ground and the wind 
toppled it over (apparently the night before). 
Almost blocked 
the road. 
Knocked that other one down too. 
Now that would have 
some pine knots onto 
it, 
once that one rots away. 
(referring to 
discussion of value of pine knots as "candles" and use by Indians 
to burn out dugout canoes). 
Now this was clear field here at one 
time. 
Fella by the name of Gilpatrick settled here. 
Way back 
in 
the early 1800's. 
He raised a family, made a living here all his 
life. 
Well, this could be "seedious bottom", that there, right 
in there, yeah, you see little stuff grow here and there. 
Those 
big pines, they probably were there when he was here. 
The 
Gilpatrick place. 
My mother—in—law said that when she was a 
young girl, two or three of the girls from Warren Grove would 
walk over and visit the Gilpatricks. 
And they walked that far! 
(This brush growing in here) 
is a mixture of different plants, 
small plants in there, I don't know the names of all 
of them. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 131 
Now that Papoose Swamp 
is right over there, not too far, 
we're going to cross it down here after we get there. 
But all 
the way up here, the head of 
it 
is way up here. 
That's where the 
Indians came when they were taken out of Sim's Place, they came 
down here along Papoose and settled. 
Our historical society had 
a dig there and we had an archaeologist with us, 
and we found 
half—a—dozen pieces of stuff. 
Like clay stuff, and even part of 
a clay pipe. 
I started the (historical society) 
in Stafford. 
I 
was it's first president in 
'65 and '66 and now I'm president 
again. 
Stafford Township historical society. 
Warren Grove, 
where I live 
is 
in Stafford Township. 
We got several townships 
in Warren Grove. 
This 
is that same scrub thing (pine) that don't amount to 
anything. 
This is Pine Barrens, that's what they are. 
Now this 
takes you into Sim's Place; you can't go 
in there, they got it 
blocked off. 
They got the whole area blocked off; no one can get 
in there. 
Because of thievery. 
There's a couple of families 
that has charge of 
it. 
They produce a lot of berries there. But 
they've been going in there, stealing parts of tractors. 
They 
have over a thousand acres of cranberry. 
No blueberry. 
They 
have blueberries but they only about 5 acres of that. 
They've 
been abandoned. 
(Name of grass there?) 
That's Indian Grass. 
That's all 
you'll find here along the dry bottoms, 
is 
Indian Grass. 
Well, 
it's Pine Bottom, but it's DRY Pine Bottom. 
There's pine bottom 
in edges of savannah bottom too. 
I'm trying to figure out where 
a piece of savannah bottom is here (to show to EH). 
Q: 
Is 
savannah bottom always wet? A: Yeah. 
Usually wet. 
Usually clay. 
See this 
is not clay, this is sand. 
Most of your pine bottom is 
sand bottom, other than the one that's grows along the sloughs. 
Q: But there's no oak bottom around here? 
A: Nope, not in 
this area. 
You'll find your oak bottom around Warren Grove, 
that's all. 
I think I mentioned the other day that people 
settled on oak bottom. 
Yeah, someone cleared a piece of oak 
bottom and took the stumps and all 
out, and first thing you know 
you have a clump of pine growin' there. 
Q: 
So, 
is that 
"seedious bottom"? 
A; 
Yeah, No, 
it could develop into pretty 
good pines. 
Q: What happened in this open area here? 
A: There's 
a survey line right there. 
They cut firewood out of here. 
They 
cut the pine out of here. 
(Discussion of pulp cutting) 
That's 
for pulp wood. 
They cut all 
the pulp wood out here. 
This 
company here wouldn't sell them this. 
They cut most of your big 
pine out for pulpwood, for paper. 
Well there was years back (a 
lot of pulpwood companies working), there was three or four 
outfits 
in here cutting. 
But we don't have anybody in now. 
Yeah, all 
this pine 
is good for pulpwood. 
Anything 4 inches up. 
If 
it's too big, they have to split it. 
Don't even bother with 
the big stuff. 
They take it up 
in the city somewheres. 
I don't 
know where. 
They carry about 15-16 cords (on big logging trucks) 
on there, take long trailers. 
Now here's your "seedious bottom", scattered pine and mostly 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 132 
cleared bottom, that's all clay in here. 
THE seedious bottom. 
That was... 
they may have had cranberries in there at one time 
or something (it's wet). There's man—made markings in there like 
ditches and stuff 
in there. 
There used to be, cleared off of 
something there, you see. 
Several types of brush grows 
in there. 
Nothing grows that's worth anything. 
Now if that was grassy. 
There's a piece like 
in there, that would be 
like savanna bottom. 
But savannah bottom is usually grass, and there is a piece of 
it 
right in there. 
There's a piece of savanna bottom goes right 
down through in there, the grassy spot there. 
That grass 
(savanna grass) 
is just like wire. 
Now there's a cranberry bog 
over there, see 
it? 
It's the 18 acre bog, at Sim's Place. 
This 
is 
all Sim's Place. 
Now we're going to get into the Papoose 
(pronounced pop—oose) bogs here. 
There's a 60 acre bog on the 
east end of this plantation here were savannah bottom, and they 
cleared it off and put cranberries into 
it. 
There's a strip 
there of savannah bottom I know. 
...lived 
in there, there's the 
remains of a shack 
in there yet. 
An Indian family lived in 
there. 
They called 
it the Indian farm. 
They used 
it (the "uversi") for something (medicine), I don't 
know what... 
The Indians, they used it for that. 
Q: They smoked 
it for tobacco? 
A: I don't know. 
I don't know if 
it's poison or 
not. 
No, uversi don't have no berry. 
(sic.:EH) 
It has a real 
rich leaf 
like to 
it, deep green. 
Now here's your Papoose Bogs. 
That's the road we used to take to Warren Grove, a short 
cut, now they out it right off. There's two cranberry bogs here. 
I was over here and got some cranberries here last fall. 
I 
called them up and asked if I could get a little, and he said, 
"Go ahead." 
I've gotten them for (70?) years now. 
Yeah (I pick 
my own cranberry supply), I scoop 'em. 
In the winter time they 
have to flood them. 
to protect the roots. 
(They'll keep the 
water on them) until April, until frost season is over. 
the 
ink 
berry 
is altogether different (from bayberry, examining specimen 
of 
inkberry, Ilex glabra, with some fruits & leaves still on, 
identified by Jack as bayberry, apparently in error?:EH). 
They 
look exactly the same, but the inkberry 
is a briar, 
it's got 
stickers like briars, but it's loaded with these indigo berries 
or inkberries. 
Q:What do they use bayberry for? A: I don't think 
they use 
it for anything. 
Oh yeah, sure, yeah (ducks nest in here). 
There's a couple 
of ponds back there, Poles (?) Pond, there's Peacock Pond up 
there, 
... 
About the last pure water left 
in New Jersey 
(indicating a stream at crossing) cause there's no pollution into 
it from here to the end. 
Right in driest weather, now that's 
only a narrow swamp,Papoose Swamp, and 
it gets narrow as it goes 
up through the Plains, then 
it dies out up there. 
Where all 
this 
water comes from ? There must be some pretty good springs cause 
this 
is flowing like that all 
the time regardless of the 
condition of the weather. 
It all 
goes down here to the main 
stream that you seen 
in Warren Grove that goes into Oswego Lake. 
We'll go as far as the lake, then we'll turn back. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 133 
Oh yeah, (you can just drink the water out of the streams). 
That water, you don't have to worry about anything. 
Not here. 
No human beings that live up there (upstream). 
Now Bear Swamp 
Hill 
is down here about two miles. 
Well the CC boys was there, 
the CC camp. 
They cleared the hill off on top, built a wooded 
cedar deck about 50 feet square, about 14 feet above the ground. 
And you get on that deck, you could see as far as you can see, 
you can see the Plains, you can see the tops of the trees as far 
as you can see. 
And then they decorated their parking area with 
laurel, made 
it nice. 
That was back in the 
'30's when they had 
the CCC camp, yeah. 
They're the ones that made the 
lake here 
too (Lake Oswego:EH). 
That was cedar swamp and they cut the 
cedar swamp off and built a dam and made a lake. 
One of the 
nicest recreation areas... 
They (vandals) destroyed everything. 
They come from all 
over. 
You couldn't get in there on a weekend 
Saturday or Sunday, during the week too. 
Nobody destroyed 
anything for years, only here 
in the last few years, man, I tell 
you, there's something wrong somewhere. 
Youngsters. 
That's the 
main fish (you catch here, the "pike"), catfish and pike. 
The 
biggest pike I see was about 24 inches. 
That one was caught in 
my bog, 
in my swamp. 
This was a farm here, the Penn farm. 
My wife's ancestors, 
they worked here. 
They settled over here (the Penn family?). 
That's why they named the forest after them. 
Yep, William Penn 
(Q: Did Jack's wife, Pearl, can berries?) A: Not in the last 
few years, she hasn't. 
My mother used to . She canned an awful 
lot of blueberries, cranberries, and all 
that. 
Only thing Pearl 
does 
is make some grape jelly, from Concord grapes. 
Q: What are the kinds of woodswork? A: There's, you can 
pick pine cones, there's a ready market for pine cones. 
Now, 
if 
you work for an outfit like there is up 
in Whitings (Allyn 
Co.:EH), 
if you up there they might give you a job to pick 
certain brush, pay you so much for it. 
Then you have your laurel 
stalks, this 
is where they buy laurel stalks. 
And 
in the fall 
of 
the year are these people that make blankets for cemeteries, use 
the pine needles. 
You go to where they're cutting cedar wood and 
you just cut the branches off and 
pack 
it off. 
You can get a 
good days pay there. 
Oh yes, there's ... 
A man wants to go out 
in 
the woods and ... 
(can earn enough?) to get something to eat. 
Yeah, you can go pull moss. 
Of course the demand isn't there 
like they're used to be, still there's sales for it. 
Q: How much 
could you make 
in a day 
if you worked hard? 
A: Well, you don't 
make no big money, of course. 
Now back when I picked pine cones 
we were only gettin' fifty cents a thousand for them. 
And we 
picked 10 -12 thousand a day. 
So that was a better day's pay than 
there was 
if 
you worked for anybody. 
EH: That's a lot of pine 
cones. 
JC: Yeah, but they were there. 
You can pick a thousand 
cones an hour, no problem. 
There's the bridge I wanted you to 
look at (under repair, at 
Oswego Lake:EH). 
That really gripes me. 
1 can't understand 
that. 
It was a very popular place. 
It's got shallow water for

TX01: G-Warren Grove, 56GT GH: What you could do, 
is 
if you have 
something you want to talk about, turn 
it on and turn it off when 
you're done. OK, you're on. 
JC: That's the triple oak, that's my west-southwest corner of the 
track here, of the cedar swamp, and it's marked with three dashes 
and a couple of carves. 
GH: When did you make the marks here? 
JC: Those marks have been there since 1904 - that I remember. Now 
whether the were there before that I don't know. There again 
is 
the tree that when I was 8, 9 years old those trees looked the 
same size to me then as they are now. 
GH: That's an old white oak, huh? 
JC: A triple white oak. 
GH: You don't see the triple like that very often. 
JC: Yeah. I always worry about the highway crew coming along there 
and cuttin it down. 
GH: So Sim's place'd be down... 
JC: And this 
is Beaver Dam Road, was originally built by beaver. 
The beavers had a crude dam across here years ago. 
GH: What's this place here? Is that a lake or a river or? 
JC: No, that's just a oswego, this 
is where you can see the 
oswego comes down, and 
it crosses Beaver Dam Road here and 
there's the main stream up there where these pipes are. We passed 
one stream down here where the lake 
is. 
GH: You want to explain in the microphone about branch again? 
JC: Now here's the main stream of the oswego - Goes all 
the way 
to Oswego Lake. Through the Sim place and on 
into Oswego Lake, 
from Oswego Lake goes down into the Wadin River. 
GH: How far up does 
it start? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 136 
JC: Well, 
it parallels 539 going up 72. 
It crosses the road before 
you get to 72 and goes up to a area called Howardville. And at 
the head of this Oswego swamp 
is between two hills and Forker 
River mountains, and they call 
the head of 
it Coffin Board 
Hollow. 
GH: Coffin Board Hollow — why was that? 
JC: I don't know — why they call 
it that, but that's what it's 
called. Part of Oswego River this is. 
It's the drainage basin of 
all 
the area. Every branch and every slough or any drainage of 
any other waterways around all 
come into this. This is the main 
drainage basin for the whole area. 
GH: Before you were saying how a branch is a real good place for 
grouse. 
JC: Well, 
low branches with no water other than when you have 
heavy rain — there might be a little water into 
'em . But there's 
plants, the food that the grouse likes, 
in an area of that type, 
and also for protection, they go 
into those briars and they're 
pretty safe. We been on deer drives — I know I've been on deer 
drives where they drove a grouse out and he jumped and come down, 
landed right in front of me. Had the gun 
in my hand, you know, 
and before I could straighten the gun out he disappeared. Don't 
know where he went, never seen him. Now this 
is (unintelligible) 
where they first put this operation in here. They had diamonds 
with 90 foot poles, with antennas representing different areas of 
the world, you know. But since that time they've improved on the 
equipment — the poles weren't necessary anymore and they have 
more sophisticated equipment. That receiving stuff, you know. So 
they done away with the poles and they found themselves with more 
property than they needed. So they — I don't know whether it's a 
regulation or what it 
is, 
but the state has the first preference 
of taking up property that the government don't need anymore, 
that's what I understand. There's the installation there. 
GH: What was this installation called? 
JC: FAA. They have three of 
'em 
here. They have one up there 
called Ship Bottom Station up near 72, 
and then they have one up 
in West Plains up there. But this is the main one. 
GH: Does anybody work here anymore? 
JC: That fellow you just seen this morning takes care of 
it. 
There's two technicians that take care of the equipment. 
GH: This for controlling the planes coming across the ocean? 
JC: We just crossed over from Ocean County to Burlington County 
now. 
GH: And that's the plains right there, right? 
JC: Yeah, that's part of the plains, part of the west plains. 
GH: A lot of pursy out there? 
JC: That green stuff on the ground? Yeah. 
GH: That good for anything? 
JC: That;s good for medicine. You turn right here I'll 
show you — 
now the state took the property over. They had to commit them— 
selves to a campground of 
15 spaces. Here's one here, there's one 
here. They had tables here, they had a pump over here, a hang 
pump, a nice pump. Had fireplace boxes. That's where the pump 
was, right over there, you can still see the ( ) back there. 
Well, the first thing you know, they busted the pump, or stole 
the pump, I don't know which it was. They were taken — what I'm 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 137 
getting at is, 
that's what we're saving all 
this stuff for, future 
destruction. Three Cranmer brothers, one George Cranmer, live 
just as you cross Beaver Dam Road, that old house on the right. 
That's one of the oldest houses in Warren Grove. Was built around 
1800. John Cranmer had a place over here, and the other one was 
in Brookville. 
This fellow settled here around 1790 or 1800, 
raised 18 children, I understand. Used to be a house right here. 
GH: What's this kind of grass all 
through here? 
JC: That's Indian grass. That's called Indian grass. We used to 
come over here and burned it when they had the house here, to 
protect the house. Now it's... 
GH: 
Is 
it good for anything? 
JC: This is - if you turn right you can follow 72. Stevenson 
Road. 
GH: That;s going north? 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: 
Is this Indian grass too? 
JC: Yup, that's Indian grass. See where they steal cedar off me 
They've cut two or three trees down, and they want you to 
leave a 
hundred feet - all 
you're doing is 
leaving a hundred feet for 
thieves. Specially back 
in here. 
GH: Now here's another kind of grass. What's that? 
JC: That's uh bluebend - they call 
it bluebend, yeah, 
it's got 
the tassel 
on top. 
GH: Kind of reddish poke at the top. 
JC: Yeah. When it's growing it's kind of blueish too, when it's 
green. That burns, oh does that burn. It makes a blue flame when 
it burns. 
GH: 
Is that a problem with the forest fires? 
JC: Oh yeah, some of 
it grows along the edge of the field, and 
when 
it hits that boy they - it 
is a beautiful flame but boy 
it 
goes up 
like gasoline. This 
is called plain branch - this dumps 
in 
to the Oswego in Simplace. It all dumps in. Here's the creek 
right here. It flows into the Oswego and on down. 
GH: So who steals the cedar, 
is that local people? 
JC: Well, these young fellas they go and get a half a cord of 
cedar, bring it to the sawmill. That's Indian grass there - see, 
the Indian grass has no tassel on 
it. Oh, that one 
is the same as 
the other one, that's the bluebend. This is the Indian grass - I 
thought you meant this one. Now this is as far as my property 
goes, down through here. Now there's a fellow from Morristown, 
New Jersey, made himself a lake here and built a pretty nice 
place on the outside right in the woods there, and he got every-
thing out of building planks - beds, tables, built in everything. 
(unintelligible)little brush 
in there where there's 
huckleberries, there's low brush. There the sweetest berry we 
have, but no one bothers with 
'em 
GH: They have big seeds? 
JC: Yeah, they have little seeds 
in 
'em . But they're blue, they're 
really light blue. 
GH: 
Is that what they out for the brush? 
JC: Yeah. Decorative stuff. The bilberry's something else - the 
bilberry's black. Yeah, with decorative ribbon on the bottom of 
it, 
it looks pretty. Has a taste of 
its own. There's 18 different 
varieties of huckleberries, 
in the woods, according to 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 138 
Hirschburger. I know, I've seen a good many. There's the big 
blues, the small blues, the big blacks, the small blacks, medium 
blacks, medium blues. There's the bilberry, grouseberry, the 
upland blue - I believe there is. Then there's one has black 
berries that's real small, real small and the whole bush'II be 
loaded with 
'em . But they'll be so small that no one even bothers 
with 
em . You go by that bush. That's windblown - excess water 
softened that ground, the wind toppled it over. 
GH: That might have just happened, with this storm. 
JC: Yeah, just happened. Almost blocked the road. Knocked that 
other one down too. That would have some pine knots onto it, 
once 
that rots away. This was clear field here at one time. Fellow by 
the name of Gilpatrick settled here years ago - way back in 
the 
early 1800s. He raised a family, made a living here all 
his life. 
GH: 
Is this your seediest bottom. 
JC: This could be seediest bottom. Yeah - you see the little 
stuff growing in there - those are pines there, they were probably 
there when he was here. Gilpatrick place. My mother-in-law said, 
when she was a young girl, 2 or 3 of the girls from Warren Grove 
would walk over here and visit the Gilpatricks. And they walked 
from ( ) to here. 
GH: 
Is this the bilberry or 
is 
it a sugarhuck, or? 
JC: There's a mixture of different small plants in there. I don't 
know the name of all 
of them. Now that Papoose Swamp is right 
over there, not too far over there. It's across and down there, 
comes all 
the way up here - the head of 
it 
is 
up here. The 
Indians came - when they were taken out of Simplace they came 
down here along Papoose. We had a dig there, I was starting to say 
- we had a dig there, we had a archaeologist with us - and we 
found half a dozen pieces of stuff. 
GH: 
Indian stuff, 
like arrowheads? 
JC: Yeah. Like clay stuff - even part of a clay pipe. 
GH: Are you part of the historical society? 
JC: Yeah, I've started it 
in Stafford, up - I was its first 
president in 
'65 and 
'66 and now I'm president again. Stafford 
township. Warren Grove, where I live, 
is 
in Stafford township. 
We've got several townships in Warren Grove. Where I live 
is 
in 
Stafford. 
GH: What would you call these pines - is this upland pine? 
JC: This 
is that same scrub thing that don't amount to anything 
The pine barrens, that's what they are. Now this takes you to 
someplace - can't go 
in there, they got it blocked off, the whole 
area blocked off. Because of thievery. 
GH: There's still houses 
in there? 
JC: Oh, yeah, there's a couple families that has charge of 
it -
they produce a lot of berries there. They been going in there a 
stealing parts off of tractors. 
GH: So that's a cranberry bog? 
JC: Oh yeah, they have over a thousand acres of cranberries in 
there. No blueberries. They had only about five acres of them, 
but they've been abandoned. 
GH: What's this one that's kind of tall and straight - just 
grass? 
JC: That's Indian grass. That's all 
you'll find here along dry 
bottom. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 133 
GH: This isn't pine bottom? 
JC: 
It's pine bottom, but it's dry pine bottom. Pine bottom and 
savannah and the edge of the savannah bottom too. I was tryin to 
figure out where a piece of savannah bottom is here. 
GH: 
I'd 
like to see one. 
Is the savannah bottom always wet? 
JC: Yeah, usually wet. Clay - you see, this 
is not clay, this is 
sand. 
GH: So the sand bottom and the dry bottom are.. 
JC: Well, most of your pine bottom is sand bottom other than the 
one that grows on sloughs. 
GH: There's no oak bottom around here? 
JC: Not in this area, no. You find your oak bottom around where 
it grows, that's all. I think I mentioned the other day that 
people settled in oak bottom. 
GH: And that's where you find a stand of pine 
in the middle of 
oak, where somebody built their house? 
JC: That's right. Cleared a piece of oak bottom and took the 
stumps and all 
out, first thing you know you 
have a clump of 
pine growing. Pine seed... 
GH: So is that cidious bottom, then? 
JC: No, 
it could develop into pretty good pines. 
GH: Now, what happened here? This open area in here? 
JC: There's a survey line right there. Somebody cut cranberry 
survey line, cut firewood out of here. They cut the pine out of 
here 
GH: Yesterday I noticed a big firewood cutting operation down 
near Green Bank and they had a big semi-trailer and they were 
cutting the logs about 12 feet long. 
JC: Yeah, that's for pulp wood. They cut all 
the pulp wood out of 
here. This company here wouldn't sell 
'em 
this. They cut most of 
your big pine out for pulpwood and paper. 
GH: Are there a lot of companies that are doing that here? 
JC: Well, there was a few years back. There was 3 or 4 outfits in 
here cutting. But we don't have anybody in now. 
GH: Will this be any good for pulp wood? 
JC: All 
this pine 
is good for pulpwood, all 
of 
it. Anything from 
4 inches up. 
If 
it's too big they have to split it. They don't 
bother with the big stuff. 
GH: Then do they haul 
it off - where do they actually process it? 
JC: They take 
it up 
in the city somewheres, I don't know. 
GH: I saw one truck loaded with wood... 
JC: Oh, they carry about 15, 
16 cords on there. What they used to 
around here - big, 
long trailers. Now here's your deciduous 
bottom. 
GH: cidious? 
JC: That's scatter pine and mostly clear bottom - that's all 
clay. 
GH: What was the name of this bottom again? 
JC: Vicidious. That's vicidious bottom. They may a had cran-
berries in there at one time, or something, cause there's man-made 
markers like ditches and stuff. 
GH: So, cidious 
bottom is coming up from what used to be cran-
berry bog. 
JC: Yeah, there used to be - cleared off with something. See the 
scatter, several types of brushwoods in there. Nothing grows 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs

that's worth anything. 
GH: Looks like a fire went through here. 
JC: Mmhm. Now if that's grassy — there's a piece like 
in there, 
that would be 
like savannah bottom. Savannah bottom is usually 
grass. And there is a piece of 
it right here. 
GH: Piece of savannah bottom? 
JC: Yeah, piece of Savannah bottom goes right down through there. 
Grassy spot there. 
GH: And that has savannah grass in 
it? 
JC: That grass is just like wire. Now there's cranberry bog over 
there, see it? See the opening over there? 18 acre bog. That's 
Sims, this 
is 
all Sim Place. Now we're gonna get into the papoose 
bogs here. 
GH: 
Is that that savannah grass here? 
JC: Well, there's a 60 acre bog on the east end of this plan— 
tation, where savannah bottom, and they cleared it off and put 
cranberries to 
it. 
GH: I was wondering about that pale stuff on the ground there. 
JC: There's a strip of savannah bottom in there, I know. They 
lived 
in there, there's the remainders of shack 
in there where 
the family lived. We call 
it the Indian farm. 
GH: Now you say this ouversy is good for medicine? 
JC: Yeah, they used it for something, I don't know what. 
GH: The Indians? 
JC: Yeah, they used 
it. 
GH: Sometimes they smoked it.

JC: I don't know about that. I don't know. I think it's poison, 
or not.

and Peacock Pond up there. Now you stop here at this springs —

condition of the weather. 
GH: All 
comes out of the ground, eh? 
JC: 
It all 
goes down to the main stream that you seen 
in Warren 
Grove, goes into Oswego Lake up here. We'll 
go as far as the 
lake. 
GH: You can just drink the water right out of the stream? 
JC: Oh yeah, you can drink that water. You don't have to worry 
about anything. Not here - human beings are living there. 
GH: The pines are a little taller in here. 
JC: Yeah. Bear Swamp Hill 
is down here about two miles. 
GH: What's on Bear Swamp Hill? 
JC: Well, CC boys were there, the CC camp. They cleared the hill 
off on top, and built a wooden cedar deck, 50 foot square, about 
14 feet above the ground. And you get on that deck, you can see 
as far as you can see, you can see the plains. See the top of the 
trees as far as you can see. 
GH: So it's one of the highest places around here? 
JC: Then they 
decorated their parking area with laurel. It's 
nice, 
it's really nice. 
GH: That was back 
in the thirties? 
JC: Back in the thirties, when they had CC camps, Yeah. They're 
the ones that made the lake there, too. That was cedar swamp. 
They out the cedar swamp off, built a dam and made the 
lake. One 
of the nicest recreations as far as( 
? area this morning. And 
they destroyed everything. 
GH: What, coming down from Philadelphia and places like that? 
JC: They come from all 
over, come from all 
over. You couldn't get 
in there on the weekend. And during the week too. They're all 
over the place. Nobody destroyed anything for years. Boy, here 
in 
the 
last few years, boy I'll 
tell 
you - something wrong some 
whe re . 
GH: 
Is that the main fish you catch down here - the pike? 
JC: That's the main fish, yeah - catfish and pike. 
GH: How much does a pike weigh? 
JC: Biggest pike I seen was about 24 inches. That one was caught 
by my boy. This was a farm here - the Penn farm. My wife's 
ancestors, they worked it - they settled over here. Matter of 
fact that's why they named the farm. 
GH: Ah - that's the Penn family. 
JC: Yeah, William Penn. ( ) No, not in the last few years she 
hasn't. 
GH: But she used to? 
JC: My mother used to. My mother canned a awful 
lot of food -
berries and all 
that stuff. Only thing Pearl does 
is make some 
grape jelly. From our arbor there - concord grapes, she makes it. 
I like that. Different kind of work. Pine cone - we pick pine 
cones, there's a ready market for pine cones. You work for an 
outfit like there 
is up 
in Whiting, you go up there they might 
give you a job to pick certain brush, pay you so much for it. 
Then you have your laurel stalks, there's places where they buy 
laurel stalks. And 
in the fall 
of the year is people that makes 
blankets for cemeteries uses the pine needles - you go cut the 
cedar wood and just cut the branches off, you make a good days 
pay there. Oh yes, there's - if a man wants to go out 
in the 
woods... 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 142 
GH: He doesn't have to work 
in town. 
JC: You just have to eat. You can sell moss, but the demand isn't 
there like there used to be. 
GH: How much could you make in a day if you worked hard? 
JC: Well, no big money, of course. Now, when I picked pine cones, 
we were only getting fifty cents a thousand for 
'em . And we picked 
ten, twelve thousand a day. Now that was a better day's pay than 
it was if 
you worked for anybody. 
GH: That's a lot of pine cones. 
JC: Yeah, but they were there. You could pick a thousand cones an 
hour with no problem. Now here's the area - there's the bridge I 
want you to look at. This is the area that really really gripes 
me - I can't understand. This was a very popular place, 
it had 
shallow water for the kids to swim into, a park right over here 
we could go for a little walk 
if you care to -

GH: This 
is Eugene Hunn. It's March the 17th, and it's 12:30, 
midday. I'm at the Ball Plain State Forest in Kittley County, 
New Jersey. I'll use the tape recorder here for taking casual 
notes as I drive along, describing what I'm seeing. So at the 
Ball Plain State Part nature center, which is closed now, there 
are some campers here - boy scouts perhaps -
Is that a group that people around Warren Grove follow? 
JC: No, the boys I come with are boys from Seabright here. 
GH: And you're their guide, sort of? Leader or organizer? 
JC: Yeah I take 
'em 
out and stand 
'em 
(unintelligible) 
GH: How long have they been coming out here? 
JC: I sold 
'em 
the property 20 years ago, I guess. Been with it 
ever since. Bunch of nice boys - no drinking, no gambling, 
unusual for ( ) clubs now. 
GH: Do they come out one day a year? 
JC: No, the whole week. 
GH: There's a plant. 
JC: ( ) I don't know what the name of that grass 
is. Not to much 
of that around. 
GH: What, the turkeybeard? 
JC: No, that grass. That isn't turkeybeard. Turkeybeard is one 
stem sticking up there about two, two and a half feet high. Has 
that beard on top. 
GH: That just come up 
in the spring? 
JC: Yeah, June. 
GH: So are there 14 fellows 
in your hunting group? 
JC: This year there was 14, yeah. There's five that owns the 
club, then there's others join 
'em 
and (unintelligible) facilities 
and ( ) food. 
GH: So they actually bought the land from you? 
JC: Yeah. Well, when I first had that property around my home 
there, I had fifty acres and 
in 1950, when I had that opportunity 
to by the big tract to work in, I sold most of that off - I 
subdivided and sold most of 
it off and I only kept myself five 
acres around the house. 
GH: What do the boys 
in the gun club do the rest of the year? 
JC: Oh, they all have jobs. They all have - one... 
GH: They just get together once a year?

in, 
certain areas there where they live (unintelligible) in 
construction, name's Regan. Robertson is a retired Coast Guard 
man. Jerry Cranmer's on the police force up there. So they all 
have different jobs. 
GH: Cranmer, 
is he related to the folks out here? 
JC: Yeah, they's an old family from Mayetta, from local 
here, 
but he went up to Seabright and he's been up there about 35 
years, as a policeman. 
GH: How do you hunt when you have a stand? 
JC: Well, we — I take 
'em 
round different areas, I even take 
em up 
back here where we was, where I showed you the Gilpatrick place. 
Get back on a survey line and stand 
'em 
all about gunshot away 
from each other, and then three or four of us, we'll 
go back 
about a mile or so and take another line and what we call 
"dog" 
it. 
We try to — if there's a deer are laying down 
in there we try 
to kick him up so we can run him towards the men that's kinda 
standing back there. That's the way we hunt. 
GH: Can you hunt bucks or does 
JC: 
If you had a bigger gang, 
I used to take deer parties, b 
deer season. At one time I had 
'em 
on a stand and ten for d 
drivers, 
it all depends on the 
thick bottom you have to get c 
you'd take less. And my drives

there? I 
it 
is. 
GH: Every morning they'd get out real early? 
JC: Oh, yeah. You get the excitement and they don't want to go 
home at night. Let's make one more drive, 
let's make one more 
drive. Cause you'd kick — in those days — you'd kick deer out 
almost every time. you don't get 
em 
every time, but you see deer. 
But they don't hunt that way any more. 
GH: 
Is there a limit on the deer? 
JC: No — yeah, you only get one deer, one buck, and that's all 
you get. 
GH: Per person, or for the whole club? 
JC: No, per person 
GH: See that light green stuff on the ground, 
is that some kind 
of moss? 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: Lump moss? 
JC: That could evolve into lump moss — that's just the start of 
it there. 
GH: Oh, right in here. What about that paler stuff? Let me get 
some of that 
so this sheet moss, do people still — is there still a market for 
that? 
JC: I don't know. I don't bother with it no more. So I don't 
know. Oh, I imagine there is. 
GH: So you cut out six by six inch squares? 
if •you have a half a dozen or, 
like

thirty, forty men. Put thirty of

Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 144 
JC: Yeah, we used to take - in those days we used to pack 
it up 
in huckleberry crates. Well years ago, when the railroad come in 
to Barny Gap, that made it possible for people to ship their 
goods to the market, to Philadelphia. And the market would send 
out a carload of huckleberry crates. 32-quart crates, and then 
they cut 
'em 
down to 24 quarts. Had three tiers 
in to 
'em . Then 
you'd go down to the railroad station and help yourself, whatever 
crates you needed. You went huckleberrying, fill your crates up, 
they'd send you the tags and everything, you'd put on the crates 
and send 
'em 
up to the market. Then you wait for your check. 
GH: So what kind of huckleberries did they want? 
JC: All 
kinds. They would take all 
kinds. 
GH: You just mix them together? 
JC: Yeah, and the price was governed by the berry - if you had 
nice berries, then you got a little more money than if 
you got a 
mixture of everything. 
GH: So was there a guy there at the railroad station who would 
evaluate your berries? 
JC: Nobody would be at the railroad station. When you were 
shipping, yeah, there was a stationmaster there. 
GH: So when they'd receive them in New York or Philadelphia, 
they'd decide how much 
it was worth and send you a check? 
JC: Yup. That's the road that goes to papoose there. This 
is 
where, back there 
in Papoose swamp there you got cranberry bogs 
over there. 
GH: So with the sheet moss, you'd just ship it 
in the same way? 
JC: Same way, yeah. Well, I used to deliver to an outfit up 
in 
Tappan where they used all that stuff, used to go up with a truck 
load of stuff. Brush, oak 
leaves and pine cones, moss - three 
kinds of moss - spaghnum, peat moss and lump moss. 
GH: Those the only kind of mosses that you did? 
JC: That's a

ork City, Philadelphia, places like at? 
stly New York I guess, or Jersey - cities. 
r the club got four deer? 
r, 
yeah. Year before we got seven. Year before that 
GH: 
It's getting harder to find the deer? 
JC: No, we had more men. Had more men, we had better weather. We 
lost a couple of days on account of rain. no - the deer 
is not as 
plentiful as 
it was 25 or 30 years ago, that's for sure. Cars are 
gettin most - there's more deer killed by cars than there is 
by 
hunters. 
GH: Are there particular kinds of places where the deer hang out 
more? 
JC: Yes. Well, what I do before deer season time, I go down, I go 
hiking around and 
look where the acorn crop 
is. Where you find 
the acorn crop, that's where your deer are. That's their main 
food there. 
GH: 
Is 
it a particular kind of acorn that they eat? 
JC: The scrub oak. 
In the plains. 
If you find scrub oak - and it 
doesn't grow all over, 
it's amazing, those acorns you only find 
'em 
in spots. You'll find maybe a acre or two of scrub oak full 
of 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 145 
acorns and you go a couple, three hundred yards away and no scrub 
oaks won't have any. But if 
you can find those acorns 
— the only 
way we can tell's just follow the roads and see where the deer 
tracks are, which way they're heading. You gotta know your Ps and 
Qs on that stuff. 
GH: The men stand — when they're standing out there for deer, 
they're just on the ground, not up on... 
JC: That's right — oh no, well, a lot of the young boys now they 
build stands. Then they put bait there, cabbage and lettuce and 
all 
that stuff. And it's allowable, just so you're so many away 
you're all 
right. I don't go for that kind of hunting. If I want 
to hunt that way, I can sit on my porch and kill 
'em 
right there 
on my porch. And that's something — in 43 years I've never killed 
a deer at the house, and I have 
em 
there all 
the time. I get a 
bang out of being 
in the woods and seeing that deer go across there 
and drop him — that's the way I like to deer hunt. But I miss 
more than I get now. I can't see so straight. 
GH: Did you ever run hounds? 
JC: No. My father—in—law's a houndman. He was a coon hunter, fox 
hunter, rabbit hunter, he had dogs all 
his 
life. He was great for 
that, but I never went with the hounds, no. I used to go rabbit 
hunting once 
in a while (unintelligible) He got me coon hunting one 
night and that was the 
last time. I told him that was enough for 
me, I didn't want to get coon ( ) for me. 
GH: Why was that? 
JC: Oh, you had to walk through the swamps there at night with a 
flashlight. Fall 
in a hole. Oh, the dogs would have a coon up 
in 
the tree, they'd start bellering there. You walk there with 
flashlights, you put your flashlights up, you find the coon , 
then you try to shoot it down — nah. Not only that, the next 
morning, you got home two, three o'clock 
in the morning, you didn't 
feel 
like doing anything the next day. 
GH: So 
if you did get a coon, did you eat the meat? 
JC: They used to sell the pelt. They didn't eat 
'em . Some people 
ate 
'em . I ate a coon stew one time, 
it was good. It was good. 
GH: Much trapping that goes on around here? 
JC: 
In the weekends (?) yes — in the summertime there's a lot of 
traveling through here, 
Iotta campers. 
GH: Trapping 
JC: Yeah, trapping's pretty good here. Lotta people knew that 
area we just went through. 
GH:...go pine—coning. Some of the cones are older, some of them 
are younger? 
JC: No, the cone grows 
in one year. Yup, cone grows in one year. 
Only thing 
is, 
the new cone 
is brown. That was the demand for — 
there's a lot of other cones on there but they're dark, old. You 
take right on them trees there, you can see the old and new 
cones 
GH: So they wouldn't take the old cones. 
JC: Well, some of 
em 
do, 
the ones that color 
em , a different 
shade, yeah. They'd take 
em , not everybody. Most of 
em 
wanted 
the 
new cones, because the new cone, when it's open, 
it has a oak 
shiny finish to 
it. Beautiful. Yeah, they use 
em 
natural. Now the 
black ones, they have to be painted. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 146 
GH: You say the jersey cone looks just like a rose when 
it opens? 
JC: 
It's the hardest cone that grows in the world and when 
it 
opens up 
it looks exactly like a rose. ( )by the sizes too. Some 
of these companies, they pay you a little more money, but they 
wanted one size. You had to sort 
'em . 
GH: So how much do you get for pine cones? 
JC: Right now I think they get four and a half or five dollars a 
thousand. 
GH: Thousand would be about a bushel? 
JC: More than a bushel, 
it'd be about two bushels. Depends on the 
size 
GH: And Allen's the main supplier for cones around here? 
JC: Right now, yes. Most the people pick pine cones bring 
em 
up 
to him up there 
in Whiting. 
GH: Who are the main pine—coners around here that you know of? 
JC: Picking pine cones? In Warren Grove there isn't anybody. There 
isn't no one 
in Warren Grove. There's a few in Chatswick that 
picks pine cones, few people down here in West Creek, I see 
em 
up 
here 
in the woods picking pine cones. 
GH: Not as many as there used to be? 
JC: No. Well, 
in some areas, cones are coming back pretty good. 
Some areas, cones are coming back. New growth come in. 
(unintelligible) Well you wanta go see Chase 
( ) that particular area, no 
it's right along side of a cedar 
swamp. That's why they put the building there, so they had the 
cedar handy. They didn't have to haul that. All 
they brought 
away from there was the finished lumber. That's what happened in 
several of the areas here. They brought the mill 
in, 
right 
through the swamp. One house in here called the Road to Ruin 
Club. They had to block the road off here too. They go 
in there 
and destroy everything, steal everything. 
GH: 
It's too bad they have to 
lock everything up. 
JC: They got a club house here from Columbus, New Jersey, the 
reeves (?) club. 
GH: So how many hunting clubs are there around here? 
JC: 
19. 
GH: Does each one of them have to register? 
JC: Yeah, we have quite a population in deer season. 
GH: There's a little pond back 
in there. 
JC: Oh yeah, this 
is 
all ( ) club right there. Party from 
Haddenfield got a club down here, right next to the mill. 
GH: So how far in 
is 
it to Chases' Mill? 
JC: About a quarter of a mile, a fifth of a mile. That's the 
Leads club over there. Boy that's something. 
GH: So for 51 weeks out of the year, these places are vacant? 
JC: 
Just that one week of the year — but there's fellows in the 
clubs that likes the woods and they're down here every weekend. 
Talk about a ( ) getting across the woods — it was late evening 
and there was a fellow walking through the woods. And he was 
walking in circles — he was a stranger to the woods here. I came 
along there and he 
looked, and he grabbed me and he hugged me. He 
said boy you know I was scared to death. I'm lost, I don't know 
where I'm going, I been walking around here, walking around here and 
I can't get noplace, I don't know where to go. I says, where you 
from? Oh, I says, well 
I'm heading that way. I put him 
in 
the 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs

page 147 
truck and brought him home 
Oh gosh sakes. I made a fast friend 
the re . 
GH: Where was he from? 
JC: He was down way 
in the middle of the swamp. Not knowing the 
area and you get in the swamp and can't get out, that's bad. 
GH: Yeah 
it does look all 
the same 
if you're not familiar with 
it. What's your favorite season here? Do you work all 
year round? 
JC: I work all 
year round, yeah. I have no favorite season — 
course, the fall 
is the nicest time of the year. I'd say from 
September to Christmas is the nicest time of the year. That I 
enjoy the most. ( )get the branches right along the road here. 
GH: How many people cut wood on your land with your permission? 
Those two guys we saw the other day? 
JC: Yeah, that fellow yesterday, ( ) job today he takes to ( ) 
called up Sunday, he said, I got a dog—pen 20 by 50 to build and 
I need 20 fence posts. So he says, 
I'll 
be up tomorrow and cut 
'em 
myself, and he pays me so much a post. 
GH: 
Is that cedar? 
JC: Yeah. So he was there yesterday cutting. He's got a spot there 
where he ( ) cut. Every once 
in a while he gets a job where he 
needs some posts. 
GH: What about the firewood cutters? 
JC: Well I had quite a crew of firewood cutters but they stopped 
me — they sent 
'em 
word that they couldn't cut no more so I lost 
'em . I lost 
'em . 
GH: They went somewhere else? 
JC: Yeah, sure. 
GH: Think they'll come back? 
JC: I got punished for something that I didn't think I ( >. 
GH: 
Is the demand for firewood out here pretty strong? 
JC: Well, 
it 
is 
at that time of the year. See, now it's slowed 
up. Getting warm, they don't.. 
GH: They're not up to cutting it now for next year I guess. 
JC: Well some people would invest the money for storing wood and 
some can't. 
GH: Those two guys that were out cutting Sunday, where do they 
come from? 
JC: They're from Barney Gap. 
GH: So they sell their stuff? 
JC: Yeah.( 
) Just three weeks before Christmas. Boy, I'll 
tell 
you they had a rough Christmas. That's why I'm convinced 
they're more interested in everything else but human beings. I 
felt sorry for 
'em 
too. Can't we get — how long 
is 
it gonna take 
to get back? I said, you guys have gotta have, you gotta make 
enough money. (unintelligible) They go all 
over. It's quite a 
sport for 
'em . Where we was there at Stevenson Road, that's 
Woodland Township. ( ) County. 
GH: Each township has different government? 
JC: Yeah. Well, we got a bunch of 
em 
here. Five townships in 
two 
counties. 
GH: Do you have property in several of these townships? 
JC: Yes I do. That cedar I showed you, that's the Bass River 
Township 
GH: Where's the headquarters for the Bass River Township? 
JC: (unintelligible) 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 148 
GH: You have to go down there to get your permits? 
JC: Oh yeah, sure. 
GH: 
It's kind of complicated. Do you have to pay for these 
permits? 
JC: Yeah, 230 dollars. More than tax (unintelligible)well I pay 
about three some in taxes. Now where you see that improved road 
there you're going out of Burlington into Ocean. You're in Little 
Lake Harbor Township. You were 
in Bass River Township, now your 
in Little Lake Harbor Township. 
GH: There we go, we're by the station. 
JC: Yeah, the FAA station. Somehow I wouldn't want to be up 
the re . 
GH: Do you use these, or does Pearl use any of these plants for 
medicines? 
JC: No. This 
is the old George Cranmer place. This on this side 
was built in 1790. Yeah, the old George Cranmer place. 
GH: George Cranmer worked 
in the woods too? 
JC: Yeah, everybody worked in the woods in those days. Everybody 
— up until the second World War, everybody in Warren Grove worked 
in the woods. 
GH: Are there any young people around here now that want to work 
in 
the woods too? 
JC: Oh I got, yeah, a couple of young boys. That's where the kids 
go 
ice skating, here. 
GH: Do they go out with you to 
learn the ropes? 
JC: Yeah. One of 
'em 
is cutting on me — he went to college last 
year, stayed six months and he come back. No, he said, 
it's not 
for me. He'd rather be here working. Yeah, he's very much 
interested in forests. he's the fellow that calls the stuff on 
the ( ). 
That's Laurel Sportsmen's Club. 
GH: That's where you went to school? 
JC: Yeah, four years I was there. Four years here, four years in 
the city. 
In elementary school. Then I went to high school 
GH: Where do the kids around here now go to school? 
JC: 
(unint) well, we had kids — all depends what township they 
live 
in. 
If they live 
in Little Lake, they go down to Tuckerton, 
they 
live 
in Stafford they go down to Hawkin, they live 
in Bass 
River, they go to New Bedford. We had four buses coming here for 
two little kids. It's ridiculous. 
GH: So there's not a school at all 
in Warren Grove? 
JC: Where we going — do you wanta go down to savannah bottom? 
GH: Yeah. 
GH: So you did, huh? 
JC: We went up to Newton, New Jersey, got married there. No 
minister would marry us cause they didn't know us. Got married by 
a Justice of the Peace up there. Come back, moved 
in the house, 
been there ever since. Since 1939. We had everything furnished(?) 
GH: 
Is this just burned here? 
JC: Burned last year. Boy this was some fire. 
If 
it wasn't for 
that sand plant (?) opening there, we'd a really been in bad 
shape. 
GH: So the sand plant kind of kept the fire away from town? 
JC: That's it. 
It certainly did. 
GH: 
Is this east plain? 
JC: This 
is the south plains. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 149 
GH: What do you have, south plains, east plains, west plains? 
JC: Well, southeast is here. This is south plains. 
(unintelligible) of ground here, yeah. That's where the bombing 
range 
is down here. They fired the woods instead of the target — 
that clear area ( ) in the woods — you turn left here. And boy, 
it happened to be on a high index day, that fire did burn, did 
it 
really. 
GH: Right here? 
JC: Yup. 
GH: You have a volunteer fire department? 
JC: Oh, yeah. I was part of that. 1954. Now there's a big country 
club 
in here (unintelligible) This little branch here 
is called 
two—foot swamp. Two—foot branch or two—foot swamp. It's got its 
own creek. Plenty of water around. 
GH: 
(unintelligible) 
JC: I got a couple of old ones, yeah. Pretty well battered up. 
GH: Can I take a picture of 
it just to see what it looks like? 
JC: Sure. 
GH: What did you make 
em 
out of, what kind of wood? 
JC: Made 
'em 
with cedar sides with a piece of tin to round it up. 
(unintelligible) with a round handle on 
it so you can scoop. I 
got — our museum down there — I brought a couple of 
'em 
down 
there. I brought 
em 
up a lot of stuff that I got up around the 
old places. Shelf (?) down there with horseshoes and tools, old 
tools 
GH: 
Is that museum in Warren Grove? 
JC: No. Museum's in Stafford Township. It's an old — well, 
it was 
built in 1757. As a public building, with public funds. And about 
in 
1790, nine of those men in Manahawkin formed what they call a 
baptist society. And they met there, you know, and they met there 
for so long that eventually, a hundred years later, they got a 
deed, they acquired a deed for it. 
In some way, shape or form. 
But since the new developments came 
in to Manahawkin they had to 
build a larger church, this 
is 
an old wooden structure you know. 
Well built. And they built a new church, and we were after this 
old building for a museum. It was an ideal museum. And 
in back of 
the museum is also the

Meeting begins: 
Welcome to SWAC meeting: flag salute. 
Roll call: 
Maurice Leonhardy, chair of SWAC. 
Approval of minutes of 
last meeting 
Report by the [Utility] Authority, resolution: 
Howard Goldberg, attorney for the Atlantic Co. Utilities 
Authority. At today's meeting of the Authority passed a 
resolution, distributed to SWAC. 
He read last portion: Whereas 
Rogers, Golden, and Halpern has submitted report & recommended 
Amatol site in Mullica Township as the best site, for development 
as a regional 
landfill, 
... finds study acceptable, contains 
required information, Authority accepts study and recommends its 
favorable consideration by the Board of Chosen Freeholders of 
Atlantic County, be 
it resolved... 
(report dated April 
1984), 
adopt as supplement to county solid waste management plan subject 
to following: Board of Freeholders push mandatory recycling, 
... 
no outside of county waste to be deposited within the county 
site, reserve portion of Pinelands Park landfill 
in Egg Harbor 
Township for raw--untreated--waste in event Amatol shut down for 
repairs, etc., extend life of Pinelands Park as 
long as possible, 
continue to monitor technical developments in solid waste field 
to keep up to date, 
... 
no site be 
incorporated as regional solid 
waste site until a resource recovery site is operational. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs

Adopted by 6-1 vote this afternoon. 
Chair calling for comments from SWAC members. 
(Unintelligible) 
John Percy, (?) Township: SWAC has been dealing with this problem 
for more than 4 years. 
People of Atlantic Co. create the trash, 
create the problem. 
Has visited all but one site. 
Not prepared 
at this moment for a final conclusion. 
Until we have a plan (for 
resource recovery) on line we should do nothing. 
Can't move our 
trash to any other location. 
That's all. 
Marcia Sherper, from (?): 
Double-edge of sword for people in 
Pinelands and CAFRA. 
Airport restriction? 
2.5 mile radius. 
I"m unclear as to toxicity of ash; conflicting reports. 
Permeability of 
liner? 
2500 feet from residences, but 180 
residences just outside that limit. 
What of other sites? 
If 
non-toxic and impermeable, can't many more sites 
be considered? 
(Audience applause.) 
END SIDE 1 (RECORDED ON TAPE SIDE 2). 
TX02: Testimony of representative of consulting company. M:... I 
think (unintelligible) as the Pinelands is a reality with 
Atlantic County, 
is a difficult thing to contend with, 
in conso 
lidating the political 
input (?), and there is a review process 
(unintelligible). As far as the two and a half mile radius, we 
have checked with the FAA [Federal Aviation Admin]. The two and a 
half mile radius [from an airport] 
is actually stated 
in New 
Jersey regulation, that applies to all 
solid waste facilities. 
Our understanding is that if the FAA were amenable, this regula 
tion might be waived, but we can't get it. ( ) As far as the FAA 
themselves, they have indicated that fly ash land fill will not 
be treated as an attraction to birds in the usual sense of a 
sanitary landfill, so that particular objection would certainly 
not be insurmountable. As the as the FAA property itself which 
is 
a ( ) portion of the two and a half mile radius, there are other 
issues within that ( ) availability of 
land, plant development, 
in general suitability. Without having done a study (?) for that 
I can't answer conclusively, but the general 
impression I have 
is 
that there's a lot less available uncommitted land when you think 
about all 
that's going on there than you might have think when 
looking at the 6000 acre parcel. As far as adjacent properties, 
off-site, some of the areas there fell out of our initial 
screening criteria and I could examine that, but without dropping 
that one criteria ( 
) I can't give you the ( ) for that. A 
question arose (?) on toxocity of the ash. The best understanding 
we have of that is that the ash product, the mixture of fly ash 
and potash, which naturally results from a typical mass ( ) dry 
wall 
incinerator, 
is not that toxic per the EPA toxicity test, 
which 
is the primary definition. If you separate the individual 
components, under certain circumstances, some parts of the ash 
segregated by density or whatever, might test it. 
(Muttering from 
crowd) In terms of the liner being impermeable with the technolo 
gy available, the report talks mainly about synthetic liners, 
which are a variety of plastic compounds. There are many differ 
ent versions of those which have different characteristics in 
terms of reaction to ultraviolet light, tensile strength and so 
on. They're designed for this application, and there are specifi 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 152 
cations that govern how — these liners are impermeable as a unit, 
in other words, 
liquids do not pass through them. And that con 
stitutes permeability. Clay liners are an alternate technology; 
are the most common technology. These are slowly permeable, no 
) has zero permeability. The numbers that we showed you used an 
extremely low ( ) ten to the minus seven centimeters per second, 
which 
is ( ) low. A hundred percent would ( ). The other thing 
that happens in clay liner technology is the synthetic line 
is 
only permeable, 
it has no characteristics which attenuate pollu 
tants that might come in contact with it. The clay liner has some 
exchange capacity, and there's a possibility there of also some 
asphalt—type emissions, and there are very ( ) compounds that are 
always ( ). Our economic study looked at the synthetic liners, 
for purposes of price comparison, there are final options that 
will 
be explained at the meeting. As far as the residences within 
2500 feet, you mentioned that the ( ) developed primarily with a 
180 or so residences 
is just outside of 2500 foot buffer. The 
first point I want to make is, 2500 feet is a fairly generous 
buffer. ( )by pinelands at 2000 feet. ( 
) for other types of 
waste facilities ( 
) So numbers in this range are commonly 
discussed as reasonable buffers. In terms of what happens with 
the other sites once you get ( ) beyond 2500 feet, you almost 
have to pick a radius and ( ) count the number of residences you 
have. The impression I have is, 
if you take the ( )study as a 
comparison, 
if you go out beyond 2500 feet at that site, you'd 
probably start to pick up Warden Park as well, so there's very 
(audience objects), there's very little 
F:Unintelligible question 
M: 
If you look at 2500 feet, there's a map 
in the report where 
we've done 
it, 
you start looking for areas with no residences 
within 2500 feet of 
it, 
with very few residences inside ( 
) a 
half mile or so, you very quickly run out of options. This 
is a 
unique situation at this site. 
In terms of — the last question I 
believe was if the ash 
is nontoxic, the liner 
is 
impermeable, why 
in fact couldn't it be sited 
in many other places. Separation of 
the water table 
is a primary criteria for waste facilities in the 
state of New Jersey. 
It doesn't deal with toxicity of the ash, 
it 
doesn't deal with permeability of the liner 
( ) — this has been 
policy before liners were required, so that must be a consider 
ation in Atlantic County. As far as proximity to 
land uses, which 
is another criteria, that also doesn't(?) have an effect, and the 
main other criteria wouldn't loose their importance as — because 
of your community land use 
in the vicinity of these, of sensitive 
areas, which wouldn't vary the fact that the ash 
is not toxic and 
the 
liner is 
impermeable, I believe that... 
UNINTELLIGIBLE QUESTION FROM AUDIENCE:

these projects; they insist on an answer to question: where are 
you going to put the ash? 
Based on present technology. 
Question about research on other towns with mandatory recycling: 
Tobey answers: 
Ross Milam, Clerk administrator for Buena Vista township: 
Been a 
farmer. 
Realizes value of land. 
Accepts site choice on 
condition that only ash will 
be deposited there. (Audience 
protests: "put it on your farm. ") 
Lewis (?), Mullica Township: Has visited site twice, once with 
Tobey, once with local 
residents. 
Visit the site with local 
people before you decide. (Audience applause ) 
Patrick Killian, from Margate, NJ: SWAC recommends. 
Oversee 
consultant firm selection process. 
Opportunities for public 
input. 
Accept engineers judgments. 
Approves SWAC recommendation 
for AMATOL subject to conditions noted. 
Charlie Miltonberg, from Ventnor: 
Engineer at Baytech Center. 
Cannot take issue with engineering report. 
Interested in 
recycling. 
Read The Closing Circle by Barry Commoner. 
US pop

NOTE: I WILL RECORD ONLY THE HIGHLIGHTS. 
BEGIN SIDE 1. 
Speaker (unidentified): Mandatory recycling issue. 
Have consid 
ered landfill 
issue before considering other options, such as 
resource recovery, mandatory recycling. 
Two items worth study: 
1) 
use waste from burning facility as paving material, 
2) deep 
sea disposal system. 
Thus premature to vote on landfill site 
now. 
Problem: Why choose site at headwaters of area streams. 
(Audience applause.) 
If 
liners failed.... groundwaters 
polluted... at inland sites, pollution affects many county 
citizens. 
Amatol site designated as the Pinelands, worthy of 
preservation in present state. 
Therefore should consider a 
pinelands site last. 
Last two mentioned are his major 
reservations about the Amatol site. 
Ron Cuneo (??), Estelle Manor: Read statement from Estelle Manor 
governing council. 
Why designate site when there is 
as yet no 
incinerator? 
Estelle Manor citizenry are highly environmentally 
conscious. 
Concerned to preserve purity of Egg Harbor River. 
Must preserve rural environment. 
Apply space age technology, not 
another hole 
in the ground. 
(Audience applause.) 
Call for 
mandatory recycling legislation. 
Amatol 
is an environmentally 
sensitive area. 
Why are country freeholders so eager to comply 
with state directives to find a landfill site when just a while 
ago they resisted Pinelands designation. 
(Standing ovation from 
audience.) 
(Too faint.) 
Speaker (unidentified, Tobey?): criticizing "obscure state bur 
eaucrats." 
Re. space age technology, 
it still has to go into

Gene (?) , Egg Harbor Township: Refers to previous policy of 
"Ignore 
it and hope 
it goes away." 
Can't keep on waiting to 
develop a plan. 
Provides some historical perspective on original 
SWAC recommendations. 
Has visited most landfills and proposed 
sites. 
Criteria established: keep away from homes, keep out of 
water table, etc. 
There are no ideal sites. 
I think SWAC did 
its job well.

This is June 21st, 1984. Eugene Hunn, on my way to Millville 
to have a session with Tom Brown. And this beautiful sunny morning, 
shortly before nine o'clock. What I would like to pursue at this time 
— first of all I would like to ask him if he knows of the old—timer 
named Bill Lee that George Campbell recommended as a snapperer who 
now lives 
in Millville with his in—laws, his daughter and son—in—law. 
And secondly if 
he knows of any other snapperers who might be willing 
to tell 
us about their 
business. But primarily I want to get him out 
in 
the country, and 
out of the house. So far previous interviews 
seem to have been 
largely confined by the weather to the house and 
yard. I'll 
ask 
him if he recognizes different kinds of bottoms, or 
how he 
organizes his knowledge of the habitats around here, and to 
show us around, to show us the signs of the animals, especially the 
ones that he traps. And tell 
us about the interrelationships of 
plants and animals, as he understands them. Also want to ask about 
something that was 
in Mary Hufford's notes of the April visit, about 
the Indian uses of plants as medicines, that he's 
picked up or 
remembered, and sassafras root, jimson weed, 
whatever that is. 
And 
certain others — see 
if 
he can point some 
out to me. Might pursue in 
conjunction with that, some further 
consideration of his attitudes 
towards his Indian heritage. So I hope to cover at least some woods 
habitats as well as some 
marshland habitats if we have time to do 
that. 
In particular I will 
see how he does with the oaks, and what 
differences he 
recognizes among them. This morning I drove on down a 
round—about way on the Weymouth Road from Hammonton, went past the 
Atlantic Blueberry Farm. Here's the holly farm just on the outskirts 
of Millville on Highway 49, wonder what they do there. And I drove 
through Mispah. Everybody I saw in the vicinity was black, an 
interesting ethnic situation. Millville — Holly City, Welcome to

TB: No, well that's the reason. I don't think there's anything 
any prettier than the cactus. 
GH: Do you get any of the cactus growing in the woods here? 
TB: The prickly pear. I don't bother — there's so much of 
it 
around in these sand fields I haven't bothered with it. I do have 
a prickly pear that come from Texas. And I put that in 
in the 
wintertime. There's my old hens and chickens, 
look at how they're 
growing. I have to store some of my granddaughter's stuff there 
in 
the building. I have — this here, when it blooms, 
it has like a 
starfish on 
it. And here's the Texas prickly pear, course that 
grows big. I got bullhead, minny and frogs 
in there, and every 
once 
in a while you see that water going. 
GH: You've got a pond lily? 
TB: That's a water hyacinth in there. I got a loggerhead snapper 
down 
in the basement 
GH: Did you get that from a snapperer around here? 
TB: Well, 
it come up 
in the field, I guess, Delay, friend of 
mine's field, and he caught it. That's what he does a lot 
in 
the 
spring. This year he went all 
the way to Maine, took his boat, 
13 
traps, and his four—wheel drive pulling his trailer. 
GH: Just to get the snapper turtle? 
TB: He got'em to sell. He figured on'em — they told him how many 
snappers there was 
in there, he caught a total of two. And he 
just left'em up there and come on home. He was up there ten days 
and didn't do nothing. Ready? OK. I trap here and Bill traps over 
there. I'll show you where Bill traps and I'll show you where 
I trap. 
GH: We're still 
interested in finding someone who would talk to 
us about snappering. And he said Bill Lee used to do a lot of 
it 
Some people don't like to talk about it too much. 
TB: Here's one I'm working on now. 
GH: 
Is this for poker (?) snappers? 
TB: Yeah. And then I caught a — see here, this'll be my bait box. 
When I get it done I'll have the 
lid come down, I'll put a couple 
pieces of bunker(?) 
in there, and I'll 
hang this on a wire right 
down here. I'll 
cut this section out so I can reach down in there. 
Now 
if you got one 
in here that you wanta get, a lot of times you 
gotta take a little ballpeen hammer and tap him on the nose. Just 
stun him long enough to get ahold of the tail 
and get him out of 
there. Then lotta times — now if 
I'm working just in a boat, this 
friend of mine, he's gone, he's quite a snapperer man. 
Well 
he 
left 
this morning for Maine, just for a vacation with his 
wife — but 
he puts'em in barrels and then when they come 
in and 
buy'em, they 
give 45 cents a pound live weight. And a lot of times, there a 
while they'd catch anywhere from 600 to a thousand pounds a week. 
That mounts up 
in pretty good money. So what I'll 
do, see, 
I'll 
have another bit(?) come down here, see. 
GH: So where would you put it — just a pond or a slough? 
TB: Yeah, 
in the pond. And what we do 
is put, on the back there put 
a gallon jug to keep that up, just so the turtle won't drown. 
That'll 
leave a little air space in there. I'll show you some old 
snapper traps out there where we're going today. I'll throw my 
boots in the back of the truck — I brought the four—wheel drive 
around. We might as well get some breakfast. No, Bill 
is — I don't 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 160 
know how to put it - but I don't think Bill 
is too much for talking. 
He might. Did they tell 
you where Bill 
lives? 
GH: He lives with his daughter and son-in-law, somewhere in 
MiIIviIIe. 
TB: Yeah, they're right up on Sharp Street. Yeah, I know right 
where Bill 
lives. 
He puts out, well sometimes he had maybe 15 traps 
out, and 
sometimes he had three or four snappers in there. Bill -
his wife 
used to trap just as many as he did. And she run a trap 
line, and 
her sister-in-law, why, passed away some time ago, 
Blanche, and she used to run a trap line. She caught mink and 
everything. 
MB: Can you imagine that. 
TB: Well, you just help yourself. Now you're in Seattle? I have a 
friend, he used to be on the game commission here. And he's 
in 
Spokane -well, he's outside of Spokane, he's out at Loon Lake. 
...catch'em. Same way with my father. I never paid - well, I paid 
more attention to the history that he was talking about, 
like 
with 
his, how his brother carried him down, a little boy, and 
would 
wrap him up 
in a quilt, and he would saw wood. At night, after 
working all day 
in a factory then he'd go back and saw wood 
till 
midnight. To get extra money, you know, to help support the 
family. 
MB: Can you imagine that today? People has so much luxury today. 
TB: Well, we went down and got that snapper off of George 
yesterday 
and when we were down there I was I was telling her -we was riding 
by, and they was cutting and packing lettuce, and I was telling 
her, that I packed lettuce ten hours a day for fifteen cents an 
hour. That's all we got, fifteen cents an hour. But I cut wood 
too, I cut wood all 
day, and that only amounted to about 
ten cents an hour. This was back 
in the middle twenties. 
MB: That was before we were married. That was bad enough - he 
worked continuously, you can imagine. 
TB: I went up to the cotton mill, and they offered me fifty cents 
a day to start. 
MB: I was making five cents an hour at the time. Can you imagine 
that? I ate 
it all 
up with candy. Then I come home to my mother -
she made me quit the cotton mill, I didn't bring her home no money. 
TB: George Fisher - he's up 
in Maine right now - he's another one 
that don't talk. I've been with him numerous times, and I really 
get a kick out of him. We get in there sometimes and those carp -
those carp are like this - where they swim in 
GH: They get 
in to your snapper traps? 
TB: Mmhm. Usually the snappers kill them while they're 
in there. 
Once 
in a while there's one alive. If they're dead, why he just 
leaves'em in there for more bait. I'll tell you something else 
that's hard to believe, but it happens I imagine on low water -
that's, raccoon'II go 
in there. You can just open the top and let 
'em go. But then once in a while, they'll drown. Then there's 
nothing you can do with'em but just let'em float away. 
MB: That will 
be beautiful down there today. 
TB: Have you been anywhere where they gather the moss? 
GH: Yeah, back 
in October, over by the plains. 
TB: Then they gather the laurel. That's 
in the fall of the year, 
and they have a machine that makes the ropes of 
laurel for the 
decorator stores and all. This machine will rope 
it and tie 
it. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
g 
page 161 
GH: This 
is with the leaves? 
TB: You know what the laurel 
is, 
do you? It's all 
in bloom now. 
MB: 
Is 
it still 
in bloom? It's beautiful. 
TB: We cut and brought'em back, and I was so pleased when I first 
saw'em - and that's the wild turkeys. One day I rode back there 
and they were runnin right ahead of me. 
GH: The game department's... 
TB: Mmhm. They wanted the bear and bobcat but the beekeeper 
raised so much cain about the bears... 
GH: They've talked about reintroducing wolves 
in Washington. 
MB: Do you have bears? 
GH: Yeah, but I've lived 
in that area for twelve years and I've 
seen bears twice. One was a cub ... they're there, you see their 
signs, but they keep pretty shy of civilization. 
TB: We had a boy that was 
in the service with my son-in-law 
We 
had a three day trip, and our granddaughter was supposed to go on 
it but she didn't make it, so one of Muriel's friends filled in for 
her, rode along for with Lorraine. So I got up on her birthday, I 
think 
it was our second day out, so I went up and picked the, was 
outside and painted the post New York. I said folks, you're gonna 
have to bear along with me on this one, but I'm making it up as I 
go. So I says, 38 years ago today, a little girl come to bless, and 
what was 
in our home 
in practically the wilderness; picture pump, 
oil 
lamp, a little building out back, the half moon in the door, 
in 
the winter wind blew through the cracks; 
in the summer there was 
now and then a snake or two, to drop from the rafters down on you; 
in spite of all 
this, our little girl 
grew, she had her share of 
childhood ills, whooping cough and croup to name a few; cured by 
Garrison's croups they have 
in old Doc Mayall; she's been a great 
pleasure down through the years, never no heartache, never no 
tears; never no 
heartache, never no pain, so I wish a happy 
birthday, to our Lorraine. But Lorraine, 
in the face, there's one 
thing I'm glad, you got your mom's looks and not your dad's. So she 
wanted it down on tape. 
Yeah, that's what we call'em. We call'em 
that cause they come 
around and just pick strawberries, 
that's when they're thick 
MB: Did you say Jerry was coming down on Saturday? Where's she 
gonna be at? 
GH: She'll be up around Medford and Mt. Holly. We may come down 
toward here. 
TB: Where's that little bottle top, mom? 
See they have seven 
different kinds of meat. Last night I had 
snapper soup and I had 
fried snapper. It 
is, 
I'll tell you, 
it's 
better than any chicken, 
it's really delicious. See this was all Dad's property, all 
here too 
My sister lives there. That is - oh, they got acres and acres of 
holly. The owner of the sand company, he used to go out at Christmas 
time, he'd send his crew 
out and they'd cut the wild holly, and 
then he would send 
it to 
his customers, you know the sand 
customers, big boxes of holly. 
So then he decided that he'd grow 
his own. And that's what he has 
done. Now off over in here I 
catch quite a lot of fox, back 
in 
here. 
GH: Out of the oak woods here? 
TB: Well, a fox'll 
run most anywhere. He's gonna go where the

GH: What was the name of that pond? 
TB: That's Cumberland Pond. 
GH: Where they had the mill? 
TB: That's where the bud furnace was. When we come back, we'll stop 
there. I think there's a tablet there. 
GH: Now if you want to trap snappers, you just go anyplace like 
that and put out your trap? 
TB: That's — you have to watch because a lot of times the 
fishermen — you'll 
loose'em because they will, you know 
GH: Because they don't like the idea of you trapping? 
TB: No, not that. It's just — you know what I always say, Gene. 
There's people that, 
if you lost your wallet, they'd return 
it 
intact. But these same people, 
if they see an animal 
in a trap, 
they'll take that and the trap, and they don't think it's 
stealing. 
I lost a fox the first day last year, right back there 
where we come by that restaurant there on the corner the other 
side of the pond. They took the fox 
in there, and they bragged to 
the guy that somebody's trapping out of season, we took his trap, 
two traps, and his fox. 
It was the first day of the season. Well 
actually, 
it was the second day — the first day I set. 
GH: Did you ever find out who did 
it? 
TB: No. The owner wouldn't tell me who 
it was. He said, I don't 
remember. I said, well, Bob, I want to tell you something — in case 
they come 
in and you remember who 
it was, you tell'em that I 
said growing up I was taught never to fool with a young boy or an 
old man. The young boy don't know no different, and the old man 
don't give a damn. And I'm old. I did tell him that. 
GH: So maybe they got the message. 
TB: My nephew happened to be 
in there, 
in. Lotta this down here 
is state, and 
first of the year. 
GH: The woods here, for fox? 
TB: Yeah. See, the only thing we would set here for is fox. But 
you also — they holler about catching dogs and stuff like that — I 
caught, I think, three dogs 
in the last 18 years. But you just go 
in 
on these old roads, off of these old roads, and you set. Now 
here's an old road right there, see 
it? Now I usually take a fox 
and a coon out of there every year. 
GH: And they keep coming back. 
TB: Oh, yeah, there's — you gotta leave seed. We have a young man 
well, he's 
in his forties — year before he took 126. Last year 
took 78. That's gonna hurt. Now see it's a big track — this

stop for, you 
let me know. Over here is a sign, 
look here, see the 
cemetery? 
GH: 
1790 
TB: Mmhm. Now you wanta see something here 
(end of side one — about one third of tape blank) 
TB:...way back on the end of this here. 
GH: Which one? 
TB: Right back — all 
the way back 
in there about a mile and a half. 
And that's where they got the one. 
GH: Which was this? 
TB: Yeah, that's where they got it. They claim it's a coyote. But 
I don't think — I said the size of'em — the girls wouldn't go back 
there. But year after year after year they cut sod off of that 
...because you know the sod's only about ye thick. 
GH: So that's after they cut the sod? 
TB: Yeah, here's where they cut, see. 
In here. 
GH: So how long have these sod farms been in operation? 
TB: Here I would say maybe, I don't know, maybe fifteen or twenty 
years here. This gunning club, they closed all the windows. They 
cemented'em up. This man here, he makes vaults, for cemetery. My 
friend traps back here too, he traps all 
this here. This property 
over here, this field here, my cousin Louie Beebee, he raised a 
family on this property. 
GH: ... What the plants were. 
TB: Oh, back there? That was like I have 
in my pool up there. Lot 
of 
it 
is water hyacinth, see here? 
GH: With 
the big, ( )shaped leaves? 
TB: Mmhm. Now when we get down here, you'll see all kinds, you'll 
see lilies and everything along the edge of the road there. I 
didn't bring my boots — I was gonna throw boots 
in the back. 
GH: We can just look from a distance. So you do any fox trapping 
down 
in these woods too? 
TB: Oh, yeah. 
GH: 
If there was a spot where you trap, maybe we could stop and 
you could show me how you do the set. 
TB: Well, when we come back, 
I'll 
show you back at the house. 
GH: What other kinds of turtles do you have around here besides 
the snappers? 
TB: Well, we have the red bellies, you'll see plenty of them on 
down here, and we have box turtles. Now I got a box turtle that's 
came back every year for 27 years. 27 years ago I put 
pop—pop and 
Dawn on 
it, and put the date, and 
it come back 
again this year. 
It's blind, 
it's been blind for about five 
years, but it comes right 
to the back door and my wife'll feed it 
bread and we put it down 
in 
the window box for a few days and 
then release it. And this year, 
when I cut for the 
great—granddaughter Muriel, I only just cut that 
in 
'81, that one 
come back. 
GH: You cut them? 
TB: I — on the bottom of'em, I cut the initials, but any more I 
don't cut, I just heat a wire and brand 
it 
in. 
GH: And you do this for each one of your children? 
TB: Yeah, I put all 
the grandchildren and now the 
great—grandchildren 
GH: Each one has their own turtle? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 165 
TB: Yeah, and that turtle, oh they live for a long while. 
GH: Do other people around here do that? 
TB: The people have done 
it for years. It was more or less handed 
down. My oldest brother, actually it was three half brothers and 
a half sister but 
in our family they were brother and sisters, 
there was no half to 
it 
GHtaside>: Cat Pond Road and Etna Road 
TB: Yeah, this here used to be Schoolhouse Lane, and they changed 
it. 
GH: Why do they call 
it Cat Pond? 
TB: I think cause there's a little pond right up here. 
GH: So they always use a box turtle for this? 
TB: So the box turtles, why I caught one this year came back to 
the house and we fed 
it a while and let 
it go. And that had gone 
and that had Dawn and Diane - that's the two oldest grandchildren 
and that was 1960. 
GH: So you brand the year they were born? 
TB: Yeah, I put the date on, sometimes I'll put the year and 
sometimes I'll put June, see, and the date, June the 18th or 
something like that, see. 
GH: Do they always come back? 
TB: Yeah, they come back. They'll once in a while - I'll tell you 
what does away with a lot of them is forest fires. Now here 
is a 
conservation man, used to be, he's retired now. He's not around. 
But he's done most anything of that line. 
GH: What is this place called here? 
TB: This 
is part of Corbin City. 
GH: What's that, oak? 
TB: Yeah. And this here 
is a retarded 
TB: That's, this here used to be schoolhouse - there used to be a 
mill down here. Wanta see something here? 
GH: What was the highway we just crossed? 
TB: That was Etna Drive. See the forest of bamboo? Here 
in Jersey. 
Now I'm telling you, that's so thick you can't get through 
it. 
GH: About an 
inch 
in diameter. Wonder how long that's been growing? 
TB: I don't know. You know I was really shocked when I seen 
bamboo 
growing here 
in Jersey. And I'll 
tell you one thing, you 
get the 
darned stuff started and it's just gonna keep right on 
going. 
TB: These here are mostly maple. 
GH: That good for burning? 
TB: No. It's - if you dry 
it out - but see, 
lotta this here like 
the maple, 
it'll burn but it burns so fast, soft, you know. And 
there's a lotta snapping and cracking to 
it. 
If you got a fireplace 
in there, you're gonna have sparks aflying. 
GH: So oak 
is 
the best? 
TB: Oak, yeah. 
GH: Do you have a special kind of wood for starting the fire? 
TB: Kindling - just odds and ends like pieces of 
lumber or - lotta 
times cedar is one of your best for kindling. You know, 
if you cut 
up some cedar and then split it. Cause that's light and - white 
cedar. 
GH: Not the red cedar. 
TB: No, not your upland red. 
GH: Who owns the property we're going through now? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 166 
TB: State. This 
is state 
GH: There's a squirrel. 
TB: Yeah - get going. 
GH: Do people hunt squirrels around here too? 
TB: Not too much. You take in 
the South where they love their 
squirrel pie - I hunt'em, I like 
GH: That kind, or the red squirrel? 
TB: No, 
the greys. 
GH: What other different kinds of squirrels? 
TB: We only have the two - the red and the grey here. You know some 
places you have that big black squirrel? But this - take it 
easy 
going through here. See here's a little pond 
in here. 
TB: See there's tree stand right there, all 
bent down. 
GH: 
Is that for hunting? 
TB: Yeah, they... there's some kids come around in here with a 
four-wheel drive and really barreling it. 
GH: Well this'd be, you might call 
it pine bottom. 
TB: Oh yeah. You don't hear, up here - see, there's the water lilies 
in there. 
GH: Would there be snappers in here? 
TB: Yeah. Once 
in a while you might see one. 
If I see one I'll 
be 
going after it. 
GH: You just stop, run out, and grab'em by the tail? 
TB: Yeah, grab'em by the tail. They come around to meet you 
sometimes. 
GH: Then what do you do, once you get'em by the tail? 
TB: Well, get'em by the tail - if I got a piece of cord I put 
what 
we call a bridle on'em. I let'em bite on a stick and then 
tie a 
string on each end and pull their head back and fasten 
underneath 
the back part of the shell. And that's what we call putting a bridle 
on'em. Then they can't get their head out to 
bite, see. There's a 
turnaround here. They had a dozer down in 
there last year. They 
scooped that all out here. 
GH: What's the purpose? 
TB: Just for the drain. 
GH: 
Is the water up high this time of year, usually? 
TB: That water, for as much rain as we've had, 
is 
low. See 
there's 
the state sign right there. This is where the storm come 
across here so hard, the water was runnin through here three foot 
deep. Oh we got flies, 
look at'em. 
GH: 
Is that the strawberry fly? 
TB: Yeah, mmhm. The water was going right across here 
GH: That was back 
in March, the big storm? 
TB: Mmhm. They say a big house - see here where it come across. 
Can you imagine, right through that woods it was coming. 
GH: So you had real 
high tides, and high winds? 
TB: Yeah, well, you had storm and high wind and 
it brought it 
right on through. 
GH: There's a turtle dove. 
TB: Yeah. Lookit here, see how it washed? 
GH: Yeah. Do they hunt the dove around here too? 
TB: No - that is, 
they have tried to get a season on'em, and -
now this might sound strange to you, I don't wanta see the 
season. 
I like to see'em. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 167 
GH: Yeah, they're pretty. What do they say when you hear'em call? 
Do they say anything to you? 
TB: The birds, the dove? Well, that morning dove, you know, I 
usually wake up to that in the morning, at the calling. But 
they're up there in the road, you know. I had a friend, passed away 
here oh, I don't know, bout six, seven years ago, the quail, 
Man he could call'em right to him. He could whistle'em right up to 
him. Now this 
is your marsh — look there, far as you can see. 
On 
this side, they put this dike 
in see. I wants pull 
up here and stop. 
GH: What's on the other side of it? 
TB: That there is — that was meadow too, but they put this dike 
across and they flooded that for the duck hunters. See this being 
the state, why.. 
GH: So this is all 
duck habitat in winter? 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: Do you get ospreys out here too? 
TB: Yeah, you'll see'em. Now over there is the electric plant. 
That 
is over at Somer's Point. I'll pull 
up here 
if you wanta 
stop 
We'll 
stop here a minute and then I'll Take you on around. 
GH: So Bill Lee's got his trap out there? Set in about a foot of 
water, staked with his poles. 
TB: I imagine that's Bill. Bill usually traps'em down here. See how 
that goes around here, that ditch? 
GH: So the fox tail 
is this decorative grass? Is 
it native around 
here? 
TB: Yeah, this here 
is your feed for muskrats, the roots of them. 
But your cattail 
is the best food. 
GH: So there must be cattails out in this area too? 
TB: Yeah, there's cattails in here. But after we get up here farther. 
See I had three snapper traps in here. What happened.. 
GH: Does this pond have a name? 
TB: No, right here it's just impalments(?) they call'em. I had, right 
over in here, I had three snapper traps. And somebody come in here 
with a pair of cutting pliers and cut'em in half. 
GH: Why would somebody want to do that? They just don't want you to 
catch the turtles? 
TB: No, the thing of 
it was, I was maybe infringing on their 
trapping. 
GH: What kind of grass or plant is this 
in here, the darker? 
TB: Oh, that's some of the — I can't see that — I think that's some 
of the hay 
coming up. Green. Yeah, that's more like the hay. 
Got 
morning glories there, see? 
GH: How many years have you been coming out to this marsh? 
TB: Down here, I been coming down here on this one only about fifteen 
years. I always trapped up 
GH: Have you seen any changes during that time, or 
is 
it pretty much 
the way 
it was fifteen years ago? 
TB: Well, I'll 
tell 
you the truth — it's nothing, as far as the 
fur, 
as when I first come down here. When you come down here the 
rats was 
in here by the hundreds. And 
it has thinned out a lot. 
GH: What's caused that? Mosquito control? 
TB: I think — you hit it there. I was gonna say, the spraying. 
GH: Do they still spray for mosquitos? 
TB: Yeah, they spray 
in here. But not only that, but there's spots 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 168 
upin here — now see there's a duck blind over in here, 
see. 
GH: White bird out there. 
TB: Yeah, a egret(?) out there 
GH: What kind 
is that? 
TB: That's the long—legged, the small one. See here's a big ditch 
here. 
GH: So this is where you'd set your traps, along this ditch here? 
TB: Yeah, well 
this — 1 don't trap this area much as the one down 
further. 
GH: This 
is Bill Lee's area. 
TB: No, Bill's on down further. 
GH: Why was that, 
last winter didn't — oh there's a turtle, 
in 
the 
road. 
TB: Laying eggs. 
Wanta get a picture of 
it? 
GH: Sure. That a snapper? 
TB: No, 
it's a diamondback. They're good eating. 
GH: Diamond back must be finished. 
TB: No, 
it'll come back. 
GH: Get out of our way. So it's illegal 
to 
catch and eat'em 
anymore? I understand they used to do a lot of 
that. 
So raccoons 
eat the eggs? 
TB: Yeah, raccoons. Yeah, you'll see — up here I'll stop at another 
place, maybe you can see where they been up 
laying and the raccoons 
see this water, 
it's down low. That's usually higher than that. Now I 
have a friend, Frank Hayes, he traps this area back in here, he does 
real 
good. He's had two or three bypasses, you know. He still traps— 
I'll 
tell you, once 
it gets 
in the blood, why, you'll be out here 
if 
you have to drag, I guess, to get here. 
GH: Well, 
it's probably something to keep people alive. 
GH: So you trap otter in this area? 
TB: I don't set for otter. I would much rather see the otter left 
alone. But you can get a permit to trap, I think, three beaver and 
one otter. And last year one of the biologists sent me the form and I 
never bothered filling it out or anything because, 
like 
I said, 
I'd 
rather see'em. 
...see 
if we can tell 
by 
its bark, you know. There 
used to be a nice muskrat house right here in this corner of this 
pond. See, 
right now you can't see much on account of the reeds. 
GH: But when you come out in the winter, you can see? 
TB: Oh yeah, you can see houses. 
GH: Do they build houses like the beaver house? 
TB: Yeah, that's practically the same. Kingbird. Now here — this 
is 
the pond I had my traps cut up 
in, 
this one right here. See 
if we can 
locate anymore. I'll 
pull 
up here where there's a wide 
spot. You can 
see all 
along here, see where they been digging 
in 
the road? 
GH: Diamondback turtles. So they make a hole that goes way down — 
looks like about six 
inches deep. 
TB: Yeah, they go right down and then they cover'em up. 
GH: And then the crows and the coons come along and leave the skins 
lying there. 
TB: Yup. Now there's some cattails, there's a few of'em here. 
Now 
I'm gonna stop right up here. 
GH: 
Is that that three—square grass that's growing with them? 
TB: Yeah. I'll 
show you up here where there's plenty of that growing. 
I'll 
pull over here. See this 
is another one of the 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 169 
GH: Ok, so you use the Conibear traps for holes and runs on the tidal 
area but you need the leg traps for 
TB: That's right. You need the leghold trap, you need it bad, 
because it's the only way we can control muskrat in ponds and 
lakes where they're, where you trap the feed beds and the 
approaches. There's no way you can set a Conibear in a area like 
this. Because the runs 
aren't there and the holes aren't there, 
unless you trap back on the 
edge of the bank. But still, there's 
only one thing you do have to 
have, you have to have a steel trap 
to control. 
And the same way with the fox. When they take our 
steel trap, we 
don't have no way of controlling fox. 
GH: What's the current status of the laws of that issue 
in the 
legislature? 
TB: Well, as 
it stands now, 
in 
18 months we loose'em. Unless they 
come up with something to take the place of'em. 
GH: But Conibears are OK as far as.. 
TB: The Conibear, yeah. But the antis are against all forms of 
killing. They — it's not just your... 
GH: 
...there's a couple other mallards. So they nest out here. 
TB: Mmhm. There's three out there. 
GH: That the primary duck you get out here nesting? 
TB: Mmhm. 
GH: Oh there's a bunch of diamondback turtles on a log. 
TB: Yeah, that's mostly, I imagine, red belly. 
GH: Diamondbacks stay more on the sides(?) 
TB: Yeah. 
TB: The first day — well, 
it was decoration day, and he was back 
there on Labor Day and the little snappers were throwing(?) around. 
GH: How long does that take? 
TB: Well, 
it had been one, two, three — three months. 
GH: So, 
let's see, this 
is called Minnie Pond? 
TB: This right here, the little place here, 
is called Minnie 
Pond, on 
account of we catch minnie — now you'd be surprised, we 
nickname 
these places and the first thing you know, everybody that's down here 
is calling it the same thing. Now over here, I call this Goose 
Island, because there's always geese out there. I jumped three 
deer on that one one day. My nephew tied — or, my cousin I 
meant to say, he tied these ribbons on here because there was 
washouts in the road. 
He did it so that these guys 
coming down here what work for the 
state, they'd know where the 
holes was, they wouldn't miss'em. 
GH: The whomper snake is about six or seven feet long? 
TB: Well they vary, but we have seen'em — look at the kingbirds. 
GH: They're thick. So the whomper looks most like a pine snake? 
TB: Yeah, he 
looks kinda like a pine. 
GH: 
Is 
it dark, or striped? 
TB: No, they're light with the dark stripes on'em. 
GH: How about the water snakes, how big do they get? 
TB: Water snakes is not too big, maybe thirty, thirty six inches. 
GH: Are they striped? 
TB: They're dark, more like the, with the check out more. They're 
different. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 170 
GH: So the whomper they call a pilot snake too, because it's 
supposed to indicate where the rattlers are? 
TB: Yeah, that's what they claim, where you'll find them. I don't 
know, 
it may be just 
a folktale you know. There's the Seashore Bridge over there, can you 
see 
it? 
GH: Yup, that's on the Garden State Parkway? 
TB: Yeah. There's are egret over there. 
GH: Are they herons or egrets? 
TB: Egrets I think. The heron, what we 
have 
is 
the great blue 
ones here. I'd 
like to see one 
if I could. 
Now this here used to 
be one of my best trappin - right in here. 
It was all foxtail, 
and then the state sprayed it, and when they 
killed that, that's 
all 
three-square in there now. You might now 
and then catch one. 
Now I was down here couple weeks ago and I was 
fishing right here, 
and I caught a, 
oh I caught one fair-sized 
catty and the rest. of 
'em was just 
GH: That's a catfish? 
TB: Catfish, yeah. 
GH: How big is fair-sized? 
TB: Oh, about a pound and a half. I catch rats over there, there's 
one of my old trap sticks sticking up 
in there. Now 
right here, this point going out this way, why that's where last year 
- oh, there's a goldfinch. 
GH: There's a great blue - heron. Flying away, off there. 
TB: Yeah. Look at this black one. 
GH: The one with the curved beak on 
it? 
TB: Yeah, I think 
it 
is, 
I'm not sure, can't see. This 
is 
Hawkins's 
Crik here, and see the crik used to come right down 
here. Now see I 
put the boat over here, and then I go way up 
in 
there and all 
the 
way around. He's feeding. 
GH: There's the heron, the great blue, against the sky. 
TB: Yeah. Do you see the beak on him? You don't see that kind down 
here very often - look at the beak, that's got the curved beak on 
him. 
To me, now, coming down here - I see something like that 
GH: There he goes 
TB: 
...it's worth the trip down. But this is pretty deep water here, 
going around and up. See that's the old channel. 
GH: Now when they spray with the airplane to get rid of the 
cattails 
and whatever, what do they spray? What kind of chemical? 
TB: I don't know. It's deadly anyhow. 
It kills, and I say, that 
is 
what cut down on the population of rats, because when they 
spray -
is that another turtle 
in the road? -
GH: I think so. 
TB: Looks like 
it. 
TB: 
...he caught a fox, and would you believe it, 
somebody had 
it? 
Somebody took his fox and his 
GH: Must be a lot of people snooping around out here all the 
time. 
So the upland there, 
wherever there's a patch of upland you 
might get fox? 
TB: Yeah. That was the second one he caught. I told him, 
I said, 
hey, I been baiting 
for'em right here, you know, had'em coming up. 
Oh, he says, I won't 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 171 
bother trapping for'em if you've been baiting 
for'em — he's a ( ) 
nice boy, nineteen. Well, I said, go ahead. So 
he caught the one the 
year before, then he caught another one 
there. This 
is what I call 
goose island. There's usually geese 
around there. They nest up 
in 
that bank there. 
TB:...earlier this year, why, see all 
this here, reeds all 
piled 
up 
in here? Oh, all this here was a mess after that bad storm. 
There's 
old tires and, they say right down 
in here was one of those big cabin 
homes, you know, floated in there. Here's a big 
egret. Right over 
here. He's right down this bank. He's a bruiser, ain't he? 
GH: Do you know what they're out there eating? 
TB: Yeah. Minnies. 
GH: What's a minnie? 
TB: That's a little fish, about yea long. 
GH: So Minnie Pond 
is after that little fish? 
TB: Yeah. See that water's real shallow. 
GH: About six 
inches, or three inches? 
TB: Yeah. There he goes 
GH: So the minnie 
is a minnow? 
TB: Yeah, 
it's a minnow. It's what we call 
GH: So there's catties and minnies. 
TB: See that stake out there? That's a trap stake. Here's another one 
right here. Cedar, with a rag tied on 
it. 
GH: What are these, 
live traps now? 
TB: No, they'd be Conibears. 
GH: They're not active right now. 
TB: Oh no, there's no traps there now, just the stake. There's 
one 
right there, see 
it down there? 
GH: Yup. They put a little cedar stake. 
TB: Mmhm. There's a lot of'em out there. 
GH: So who's traps are these? 
TB: There were my cousin's. 
GH: Looks like mostly three—square right there. So when you set 
your traps, how far out do you walk? 
TB: Well, I go out here — I go out here about a mile, mile out 
and I 
imagine maybe, yeah I walk out there. Then I'll 
show you 
over here, 
I put my boat over here. Last year I went out with a boat, and I 
trapped the ditch because old Bill the year before, 
he was tendin 
traps and he had a hernia. And 
it broke through on 
him. And the way 
they tell me, 
he couldn't make 
it ashore — see 
there's a lot of the 
stakes in here. 
GH: So he puts the stakes out on the first day of the season? 
TB: Yeah, he puts the stakes out with no traps, just to claim the 
area, see. 
GH: So does he ever put the traps out there? 
TB: Oh yeah, he'll put them out there, but he's got the whole season 
to do 
it 
in. See that way, he gets more rats because he 
keeps moving, 
see. Moving in 
on fresh territory. Where if you only 
got the one 
section, you are whipped when 
it comes down to moving area. Now this 
here stream don't look much, but 
TB: 
...one place, and right in here 
is a run goes across this 
way, 
you can't see 
it from here. And I put wire traps 
in there. 
Would you 
believe it, first day I put a trap 
in there, 
in 
the 
morning — in the 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 172 
afternoon I stopped by, 
it had a rat in 
it, 
drownded. There's a 
butterfly, flyin around. 
TB: 
(Whistle) I got'em up home, I go like that and they'll come right 
down to me. Hang around for a few more years, just to enjoy the 
outdoors. 
GH: So the geese'll bring their goslings up to eat the 
blackberries? 
TB: Yeah, they'll be all 
up on the road here. 
GH: But you can't eat'em because of the poisons they spray along 
here? 
TB: Well, 
it's all 
according. If they haven't sprayed, why.. 
GH: And the elder — you make jam out of elderberry. 
TB: Oh, they make wine, elderberry wine. 
GH: Here's some nice plumes on the foxtail. 
TB: Yeah. 
GH: Mel Campbell? 
TB: Yeah, he's 
in his — 1 guess Mell must be

BL: I know, but, you have a guy sick. Make him shift around 
when he's nice and comfortable. For gosh sakes, why don't you get 
out and leave us alone? 
GH: So, you were going to tell me about bumpers? 
BL: Yup, that's the worst thing that ever happened to this 
country. I would say the worst thing excepting the war or something 
like that. Boy, 
I'm here to tell 
you, I should go back to 1900, 
is what I should do 
GH: OK, go ahead 
BL: because this is 
in 
the middle of 
it, see. 
In 1900, a man come 
over here from Sweden. His name was Harry Anderson. His son 
married my brother's girl, made me his uncle. Anyhow, he didn't 
speak English then, see, when he come over. Course he 
learned it, 
at last you could understand if you listen real close, you know, 
cause he's here a good many years — he was only 
in his teens, a 
teenager. And at that time, 
in the month of 
last of May, first of 
June, up here 
in Millville and all 
the way down, everybody would 
go down to the cape shore, that's down towards Cape May, down 
around where the fellows is now, wildwood fellow you know, on the 
bay. And they'd go drum fishing, see. And them drum fish they'd go 
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom like that, you could here'em you 
know, 
like that, they'd go down. Some of'em weigh a hundred 
pound. The black drum. They still 
do, they go after'em, but 
they're not thick like they was then you know. But anyway, when 
they was down there, all 
these people, they hear this noise 
in 
the middle of the afternoon till 
up to dark. 
It was just a roaring 
sound, everywhere. You just sit there 
in the boat and you here 
it. 
And I'll 
tell you how it sound (Whir). Just everywhere. And 
he was a old fisherman, what I mean is over there in Sweden 
that's all 
they do 
is fish. So he went down there, you know, 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 174 
somebody took him down. Why, he says, they're fish. He called it 
singing. They're fish singing. So him and some of'em rigged up a 
net and went down there, and they had us fishing, weak(?) fishing, 
practically every night. That was the weakfish singing and nobody 
knew what it was. They were hollering, croaking. 
GH: So that's different from the drum fish? 
BL: Yeah because the drum fish'd just go boom, boom, boom like 
that but these would make that whirring, and when you get one of 
'em croak, 
like a croaker, and a weakfish, then you couldn't tell 
the difference when they croak. But with all of'em that way, 
there's quite a story to that too but, anyway, they found out 
that the weakfish and the bumper, they didn't spawn anywhere 
else, only 
in the Delaware Bay here. They come in here 
in the 
lower part of the bay, right here where the ( ) out fifteen mile 
here where my net is, Moore's Beach all 
the way down to Reeve's 
Beach, they come in there and they would spawn. I know in 
the 
summertime we'd catch them little weakfish no 
longer'n that, and 
about September they'd be 
'bout that long. And we had a eel 
net, 
and my dad and I - that is, my dad had 
it, I was a little fellow 
7, 
8, 9 year old something along 
in there like that - and we 
caught all 
kind of 
little fish. I'd keep throwing'em overboard, 
you know, 
like that so they wouldn't die, when we dumped the eels 
in 
the boat. Anyway, as I said, they found out that they spawn 
here 
in the Delaware Bay and nowhere else. And, well, the 
weakfish, they got way down. A few year ago, not so many. But 
there was a spawn up 
in Long Island Sound. And these bunkers -
well, there were so many of'em, and everything feeds on bunkers, 
from the seagull, all kind of thing no matter what it 
is, 
and 
sharks - we've opened many a shark and found forty or fifty 
bunkers 
in 
it and they claimed they'd eat a bushel a day, these 
big sharks you know. So they went to work, I say, this harry 
Anderson, he's the one that got'em started on these weakfish down 
there, and the bunkers they seem to tie 
in together. They'd come 
in and spawn at the same time. 
GH: What time 
is that? 
BL: Month of May. And June, both of them. And then they'd have 
these little ones 
in 
the summertime. You'd have lots of 
little 
weakfish but bunkers, my god 
it was a sight. As I say, the 
mosquito commission, that's what they still do, they still spray 
- they're not supposed to, but they do. And they've killed out 
all 
the bunkers. Now look, there was fish factories, hundreds of 
em, 
down the gulf all 
the way up, clear to Courdelane. But they 
run these fish factories out of business. Wildwood had, well 
millions of dollars worth of equipment. They just give a friend 
of mine whole truckloads - cost you ten, fifteen thousand dollars 
if you had to buy 
it, had to give 
it away cause everybody, they 
just went out of business. They tried to use sharks and all kinds 
of trash fish, but they couldn't make any money. But when they 
killed all 
the bunkers 
in 
the Delaware Bay, the little bunkers -
the big ones, they didn't kill them, but they naturally died off 
GH: How big do the bunkers get when they're full grown? 
BL: Oh, possibly - I don't know as I ever saw one weighed two 
pound. 'Bout like that - a pound bunker's a big bunker. The ones 
I'm catching now's about two to a pound. Half pound apiece, see. 
GH: 
Is 
it a food fish? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 175 
BL: No, they're fertilizer. And they made the greatest, finest 
oil 
there was, and the fish was something that renewed itself. 
Didn't cost anything. And there was hundreds of fish factories. 
Billions of dollars and I know, well easy a million people or 
more'n that see, and they went to work, and when the bunkers 
disappeared, all this equipment - course the boats, some of'em 
went to 
like surf-clamming and that, one thing and another, but it 
turned everything upside down. 
In the Atlantic Ocean there's the 
most valuable fish in the seas of the whole world, I don't care 
where you go there's never a fish as valuable as the bunker. 
Cause there's so many of'em and oh, they just reproduce 
theirselves so fast you know. Like that, and there's so many of 
'em. To give you an 
idea how many there was, we had a school of 
bunkers - my daughter here, her husband's brother drove a truck, 
a tank truck, that carted the oils from the Wildwood Fish Factory 
- where he carted I don't know - but anyhow, he knew what was 
going on. Here was this school of bunkers, 
in the Delaware Bay, 
reaching up to Pierce's Point up across the ( ) a distance of 
between twenty and thirty mile. That's how long that school 
of 
bunkers was. And I don't know how many mile wide. It was eleven 
or twelve boats from Wildwood, and there must have been 25 or 30 
from Delaware, out from Louis, ( ), 
they all 
come 
in this school 
of bunkers. What they done - they were smart, the captains of 
these boats - they wouldn't go 
in that school, right in the 
middle of 
it, 
it was just such a vast school, billions and 
trillions of'em, so they would make a set on the edge. And 
sometimes, just for the 200 fathom of a troll - not a troll, a 
purse, they would have a load for theirselves and their buddy, 
they'd call him in, 
ship to shore, CB they call 
it now, and load 
him too. They'd both get a load, from just one set like that. And 
they fish there from June all 
through the summer, day after day 
after day and they still didn't lower that school of bunker. That 
there's how many there was, see. And when they killed all 
the 
bunkers, not only putting the people out of business, equipment 
and everything like that, here's these big fish, 
like sharks and 
everything else, eating weakfish - and I told you, you'd open it 
up and they'd have 40 or 50 of the little fellows - they went to 
work and they had to get something else to eat. So even the 
sharks would come 
in and get eels 
in the mouth of the crik, see, 
like that. And the bluefish, that was their main food you know, 
but yet they was gone, so they come inshore like that. They just 
turned everything upside down. There's all 
out to sea. And 
it 
don't only affect the United States, other nations as well, see. 
My golly, I don't know where they went or anything about it - I 
know they went from the Gulf of Mexico to Maine. I know that 
much, see. And I know many a person that worked on a - well, had 
a fishsteamer that went on the Maurice River, she was a big boat 
the turn of the century. I was born 
in 
1904, and 
in 1910 when the 
news spread fast that the steamer was coming 
in 
to the factory, 
we'd run from Belmont over to Heiserville - I was barefooted -
we'd run to see her come 
in cause she blowed her whistle out in 
the bay before she could get in, 
so many times each time for so 
many thousand she'd have or whatever it was, and they'd get 
prepared to unload her when they come 
in, a whole gang of men. 
She'd have hundreds of tons - she was a steamship, so she'd come 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 176 
in 
the Maurice River and she couldn't come 
in only on high water, 
but yet when she was four or five mile off there, 
if the wind was 
wrong, like to the eastern blowing off, they couldn't hear it. 
They could see the smoke, each blast you know like from the steam 
whistle and they'd count'em, and then they could tell, that's how 
they done. Now this 
is back 
in 
1910, 15, 
along in there. 
GH: Then they'd run over to meet the boat? 
BL: Yeah, when they come 
in. 
It was 
in Menhaden, the other side 
of Heiserville where she come 
in 
right there, run out there. And 
we'd stand — I've stood there and watched them take them — they 
had a big scoop, 
looked like a net 
if I remember right — they'd 
haul 
it up, they'd come up and had big tanks up the shore, you 
know, 
'cause they didn't use any ice. And in a few hours, 
wouldn't take long, why they'd be stinking you know. While they're 
under, down in the hold of the ship, 
it's nice and cool down 
there. If you wasn't acquainted, you wouldn't realize, but we had 
a boat and we had fish pens on the side, three fish pens all 
down 
next to the bottom — them fish was just as 
if they was iced up 
all 
day. And there when we'd come 
in and unload our fish, the 
fish down there nice and cool. Cause it would take them about, I 
would say, eight hours. From down off the — they didn't get'em in 
the Delaware Bay, they got'em out to sea, down off the cape, down 
that way you know. Louis, Delaware on out. That's this here big 
fish steamer. 
GH: These were bunkers. 
BL: Yeah, bunkers. Oh, they'd catch a few other fish, cause 
everybody'd clean, ( ), 
when they'd come 
in you know. They'd go, 
and when they made their set for the fish, then they weren't long 
before they come back. They might be a day getting out there, 
getting started and everything, but when they loaded, they come 
straight in. But that's one of the awfullest things that ever 
happened anywhere, to kill them bunkers. 
GH: When did they do this spraying? When did that spraying start? 
BL: Now they'd been spraying for so many years, but they didn't 
spray so bad. They've been spraying since round about 1930 you 
know. But my God, these last few years. Just awful how they 
sprayed. George Campbell, he's one of the nicest men there ever 
was, 
I'm here to tell you, and his dad, boy, we thought something 
of them. 
I's talking with his boy today, and like that you know, 
and I'll 
tell 
you that man is 
innocent. By him letting them come 
down there on their point, we call 
it, 
spraying down there you 
know, with a helicopter and all and they done helped him a lot 
and they dug the ditches for him and put banks and everything 
else, so I supposed he didn't charge'em anything to come down 
there like that. But we despise the Cape May County Mosquito 
Commission. Everybody. My, for the damage, and what they done, my 
gosh, just spray and spray and spray right on 
GH: That's what George says, they killed everything in the marsh. 
BL: They — all 
of the — we had grasshoppers fly, they would, down 
to the beach. Millions of'em and you can't even see one anymore. 
They killed all 
the crickets you know. And our little birds, I 
supposed ate them. Killed them all 
off. We had bluebirds and 
everything, and we don't even have one no more. And some people 
says that — I forget the different things they done, on account 
where they sprayed for mosquitos. It's positively awful. Take the 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 177 
mosquitos, and then the striped bass, them two things. They won't 
let you know anything, see. Like Tom Brown said about them 
muskrats there, see Tom knows they killed'em. Freddie told me — 
Freddie's supposed to be a good friend of mine — I always liked 
Freddie, see, he always done a lot for me, one thing or another, 
you know, over there cause I always worked there every day all 
winter long and the summertime snappering over there in them 
impoundments, every inch of 
it from on the other side below 
Petersburg you know, all 
the way up to Corbin City, every one of 
them ponds got tons and tons of snappers in'em. And she used to 
go when I had 
like a party boat — I run parties for twenty years 
out on Maurice River, see, and she would go and catch them 
snappers. My gosh, some day she'd have four and five hundred 
pound. And some of'em'd weigh twenty, thirty pound apiece. 
GH: So how do you catch one? 
BL: Just sit still. Now, somebody took my new net I bought — made 
me mad and I said I'll 
never buy no more, so you know what I 
done? Got some twine. When I was a little fellow, 7, 8 years old, 
I went to work and I knitted myself a snapper fyke. Now 
there's one snapper fyke.See this? Now look — you wouldn't 
believe that was done by hand, without a measuring stick. I done 
every one of'em like this. By hand. 
GH: 
Is that a one inch mesh? 
BL: Well, supposed to be about three inch. See this? This 
is 
where I out the other one off. It's more job starting than 
anything else you know. To start, you make about twice as many 
meshes — that's 25 meshes takes twice that many, you got to have 
50. You put strings through 
it 
like that and hang it up and then 
you get it started, see, once you get it started and then you're 
all 
set, see. Now this one here, I'll cut off about that much, 
see 
like that, and then the rest is snapper . Now what you 
do, 
see — still using my — just take a hold of that right there. 
GH: OK 
BL: See this? 
GH: 
Is that the bothum, you call that the bothum? 
BL: See you go 
like this — and you keep that even, and you keep 
that even — you just guess at 
it, 
see, with your fingers. And 
this 
is a fisherman's bend, see you make certain it don't get 
beyond that, now you pull 
it there — what I do, I pull 
it all 
the 
way around like that and 
it only have to be one mesh, otherwise 
you have to put two. See this? Go around and around and around 
and around. 
GH: Want to do one more so I can see? 
BL: Yeah, I can. I do it fast when I'm doing it. 
GH: So how long did 
it take you to do this much, about six feet 
of net? 
BL: 
'Bout two days. 
GH: How long will 
it be when you're done? 
BL: That's all 
done. Now look, see this? Now you put four hoops 
in 
it. You put this — double this under, so many meshes like 
that, and 
it goes 
in there and 
it makes a funnel. I generally 
have some 
in 
the car, but I don't have any here, they're all 
at 
home. I could even get you one. There's four hoops, and I use 
grapevine for hoops. Tie a knot in the grapevine, you know, see 
like those, and I make hoops about that big. And I put a bait 
7 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 178 
string in 
the middle. 
GH: Do you 
leave one end up out of the water so the turtle won't 
drown? 
BL: I — all 
of the top of the fyke is out of the water like this. 
just so the funnel 
is under. In the meadow, when the tide raises, 
I stick that up on the bank, the tail end, and let this off, see. 
Then they can go up and breathe. 
If you didn't — once 
in a while 
one'II go under your funnel and they'll drown, but I make certain 
that that's up on the high water. That's 
in tide meadow. Them 
pond holes(?) there is nice, cause they never underneath. Water's 
only 'bout so deep there. 
GH: You catch more 
in the ponds than in the meadows? 
BL: Oh, yeah, you catch more 
in the ponds, but you can pick'em up 
so fast and easy in the pond. Where 
in the tide you don't. But 
you set' em 
in the pond, they steal every one you set 
if they can 
be seen, down the crik, the outboards — I have to go up a ditch 
and hide'em like that you know. But I'm not bothering this year, 
I'll 
tell you why. I'm catching weakfish there, and I'm going twice 
a day and I'm gonna set my clock tonight so — I went this morning 
at seven o'clock — and day tides you don't do so good, I only had 
four fish last night and I had 42 this morning — the same net, 
see. And it's on stakes, they're stationary there. And it's 
legal, I got my license — cost you three dollars a net, cost me 
nine dollars and I got three nets. 
GH: How long are your nets? 
BL: Thirty fathom. They're thirty fathom or smaller. These three 
of'em is about, I'd say 25 fathom, but one of'em, as I said, I 
had to cut in two. 
GH: How heavy 
is a net like this? 
BL: Oh, you can put the whole thing un 
it — it's like the ( ) use, 
it ain't I 
like we always used. My wife and I, 
we 
fish days cause the fishermen wouldn't 
everywhere. Run us out. Couldn't catch 
net overboard they'd — one here and on 
all 
around you, so we went out nights 
thousand pound each night. They'd come 
pound a day. Made'em mad, they was gon 
acid on our nets, fellows come and tol 
gonna do, 
so I got one of the main guy 
Brown. My dad and I was fishing. "You 
tomorrow afternoon, so we'd be there b 
we'll show you" So he was there. So we 
how to do 
it and all, and he made a se 
lot of fish, caught maybe a hundred po 
we'd make ten, fifteen set during the 
pound or so. He made that one set and 
the next set after dark — and we used 
know. Yeah, we'd run our net off like 
shore off 
in the bay, we'd turn our ne 
around this way, then we'd — long 
line 
our buoy. Sometimes we'd pick this up, 
flashlight on 
it you know, sometimes w 
back here and over the stern, take our 
we'd do 
it, and 
if we'd pull 
it 
in, wh 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
derneath your arm and carry 
ike you would use on a boat 
fished, and we couldn't 
let us, they chased us 
no fish, yeah 
if you put a 
e here, and run right off 
after dark. And we'd get a 
in with one, two hundred 
na burn our boat up, put 
d me everything they was 
s, 
his name was Harry 
meet us to Wrigley's Ditch, 
efore sunset, and maybe 
made the set and told him 
t too. And he caught a nice 
und, see, 
like that. But 
night and get our thousand 
he guessed he couldn't make 
a flashlight on our net you 
this — if this was the 
t, 
swing around, come 
we'd tow it like 
this to 
this light, have a 
e wouldn't. We just pull 
fish out. Once in a while 
en we was catching fish, 
page 179 
we'd drop our anchor overboard and overhaul our net and get all 
ready, that's for the next set you know. Run 
it off. But my dad 
and I, we'd fished all 
night. My wife and all, we'd fished all 
night. And for weakfish, 
if 
this 
is the shore and this 
is 
the 
bay, see, offshore a hundred, two hundred yards, maybe a half 
mile, maybe a mile. We knew where the best places were. We'd run 
our net lengthways with a light each end — run it right straight. 
GH: Parallel to the beach there? 
BL: Yup. Then we'd come 
in here, up and down, wide open — like a 
big roll, around and around, and then drive the fish to the net, 
and then pull. Then we'd go to another spot. Six big sets. And 
we'd get, you know, a hundred, five hundred pound a set. There 
are a hundred 
we'd only ma 
knew where t 
whatever you 
that's where 
it. But righ 
GH: So you d 
BL: 
(unintel 
GH: What kin 
do you use, cedar? 
BL: Oh, we g 
s of'em down at the place, you know, 
'bout 
around 
en 
big aro 
en feet long. Jam'em way down 
in the mud 
and lean'em 
owards shore. I make the top line fast 
here and let 
re. See, and I work on the inshore side. I 
I got some 
put bricks — 
in the car with snoods on'em about that 
ricks'Il go 
BL: Yeah. 
GH: Cause I saw them all 
up and down the beach — they come up on 
the shore and die. 
BL: Oh, there's dead ones everywhere, 
it stinks upon the earth. 
But there was a lot that come ashore last night — live ones. They 
were turned over by the waves, washed'em over you know. 
GH: Do you ever do any railbird hunting? 
BL: Years ago, this was the greatest place, Maurice River. They'd 
always give a man fifty dollars a day — for to push, one man he'd 
push one man 
in the boat, I don't think I ever took two. And I 
might took two. Cause this meadow down around Marshtown, on below 
here, tide waist—deep on the high water, and it'd be just lined 
with'em. Whatever their limit was, 25 or 30, he'd push them 
through there — had a sharp(?) both ends of this boat you know, 
and he'd stand up with this big long pole 
and glide 
it there. 
Snake box — well, they call 
it — the snake box 
is more of a flat 
boat and wider, that you go ducking 
in and you build a blind. And 
the railbird boat is more narrow and sharp both ends like this, 
see. So you can push 
it away, and about going around through them 
tall — well, we always called it freshwater, you know. 
GH: 
It wasn't in the salt hay? 
BL: No, 
it was up 
in the fresh. Oh, four or five mile up the 
river. Up at Marshtown, way on up. Cause of them big reeds, just 
solid seeds in the Fall 
of the year, you know, September. And 
man, them railbirds was everywhere. 
GH: 
Is that that three—square grass? 
BL: No, the three—square don't grow so high and 
its got the 
little balls on 
it, 
they're roots is good for muskrats, 
like 
that. But that wouldn't be no good for the railbird I think. But 
this other stuff grows up way high and just solid 
GH: Foxtail? Or cattail? 
BL: No, no, foxtail's got no feed. Oh, cattail, that there's 
wonderful for the muskrats. But this is fresh(?) 
GH: This is some other kind of grass, a reed. 
BL: You can go down there 
in the Marshtown now, anywhere along 
this river, and look and see 
it growing now everywhere. 
GH: Does it have its seeds on 
it? 
BL: Not now, I don't think it would, but it will 
in a month or 
two. 
GH: How tall 
is 
it? 
BL: Oh, 
it'll 
grow up there seven or eight feet high anyway. 
GH: And the rails'II be down in? 
BL: Yeah, they just, they're everywhere, the railbirds. 
GH: Does this have a round stem? 
BL: Gosh, I never paid much attention to 
it, 
but I've just pulled 
it up, 
lots of 
it. 
I pull 
up handfulls and put it on top of my 
snapper flake(?) so the herons and things wouldn't see my bait, 
you know. Cause they'd set right on there and reach in and pull 
your eels out. 
GH: The herons would come 
in and take the bait? 
BL: Yeah. We have the blue herons and now we're getting a awful 
lot of white herons — egrets, you know. We always call'em the 
white heron. 
GH: So the big ones and little ones are the egrets? 
BL: Well, the white herons, them big tall ones like this, they're 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 181 
the egrets. Now I don't know what your little — we always called 
em pokes, the little ones, cause we had the blue poke you know. 
GH: Blue poke — that's the little blue one? 
BL: Yeah. 
GH: Do you have a little tiny greenish one? 
BL: Well, we have little ones no bigger'n this. 
GH: What do they call those? 
BL: Well, we always call them the little yellow poke. But I don't 
know the right name. Cause that's our name for'em, and the blue 
poke. Then we have the squawk — that's the night heron. 
It 
hollers, squawk, squawk. My wife, she got a kick out of 
it — I 
went and sit down with a gun and she was with me, and I heard a 
squawk, 
like that, and the old squawk keep coming and I shoot'em 
and killed'em and (unintelligible) at sunset, at night you know. 
GH: Are they good to eat? 
BL: Oh my god, yeah. My Dad wouldn't let me, when I was a boy, 
gun'em until 
(end of side one) 
GH: So your Dad wouldn't let you gun'em until there was a full 
moon 
in August? 
BL: Full moon 
in August. 
GH: Why's that? 
BL: Well, because that's when they were so fat, then. I could see 
all 
night and have a full moon 
in August you know and that's when 
they could just fly. 
In August they was big enough to fly from 
the woods down to the meadow and they used to sit around down 
there and just eat all night, you know, 
like that. — just like 
snapper. My Dad wouldn't let me go set snapper fykes until 
after they laid their eggs. Around the first of June. Now, 
cripes, ( )that you can catch'em better in April, May, than you 
could, so, I never paid any attention. I don't know whether 
conservative they was, old people, saving'em you know or ( )they 
done racing or whether they figured you couldn't catch'em. Never 
figured that one out, see 
GH: Now you go for snappers any time? After April? 
BL: Yeah, just as soon as they come out of the mud. 
GH: They come out of hibernation in April, right? 
BL: Yeah. 
GH: And how long do they stay out? 
BL: Oh, till 
the frost in the Fall you know. 
GH: And you can catch'em any time 
in there? 
BL: Yeah, there's no 
law on that. But the diamondback, the salt 
water turtle, they tell me there's no 
law on them now. There used 
to be. But see, then first of November, all 
through the Winter, 
and then out the first of April. See all Summer you couldn't 
catch them — twenty dollars fine. Cause I had one 
in my boat one 
day and the game warden he come down there and fined me twenty 
dollars. 
GH: I guess, they said they were getting pretty scarce there for 
a while. 
BL: Well everybody was after'em. They got three, four dollars 
apiece for'em. 
GH: I understand there's a lot of different kinds of meat on the 
snapper? 
BL: Oh my god yeah — like chicken, pork chops, beef, and 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette to gs 
page 182 
everything else. 
GH: Where do they come from, a different part? 
BL: Oh, 
the legs. Then the neck. Then when you pick it out of the 
back, boy that's the nicest meat there ever was and tender, you 
know. And the big shell, you have to have like a spoon or 
something, a special thing you hook around — I never cleaned one 
in my life, my Dad always cleaned'em and one thing and another. 
GH: Who cleans them for you now? 
BL: Whoever you sell'em to, I guess. 
GH: You sell 
it whole? 
BL: Last year, I sell'em to Bailey, 
in April clear to September, 
forty cents a pound, no 
less nor no more, same price. And this 
year somebody took him some and he wouldn't buy 
'em, that's what 
the wife told me the other day. So I haven't bothered because I 
been fishing and I don't have time. Now, I got two snappers now. 
Yeah, I picked'em up and they're down 
in the yard there — not 
very big, they're only about three pounds apiece. Down there, I 
guess I'm going to 
let'em go somewhere down there. 
GH: Three pounds is about eight inches? 
BL: Yeah, about like that. 
GH: What's the biggest ones you get? 
BL: Forty — we had one forty four pounds I think was the biggest. 
Somebody 
GH: How long would that be, about? 18 inches? 
BL: Oh no, about like that. 
In the lake there one fellow caught 
one, 65 pounds. ,Jesse Ford, he's dead now, he got that snapper, 
couldn't get it 
in the flight. He was trying to get it 
in. Course 
I wouldn't want this said, because they'd shoot a guy, but I 
could tell you something that's going on over there where Tom was 
talking about — dope, you know. 
GH: Well 
I'll turn it off... 
BL: 
...sure are lots of'em you know. Water about like that. 
GH: 
Is that the place that Tom calls Goose Island? 
BL: Now I suppose so, but I don't know the name of one of them 
islands or anything else. 
GH: He just made that up I think. 
BL: Yeah well we made up a name of — Bridge Ditch and things like 
that. 
GH: Well he was telling me today about how they'd sprayed that 
island to kill 
off the foxtail and cattail so the three—square 
would come up for the ducks, right? 
BL: WeII anyhow, every one of them streams come up 
in there — see 
that impoundment wasn't there, that bank wasn't around there, 
see, back 
in 
1930, 40. They put that there, Howard Willy put that 
there afterwards. One man worked the digger. He had help, the 
guys, you know, but one man did that. Howard Willy put all 
them 
banks there. They went to work and every one of them streams, a 
lot of'em, wandering around there, 
in the Summertime you get, 
there'd be hardly a bend you'd come around and go to but what'd 
be a flock of either young black ducks or keel. They was the two 
principal ones. Now we have wood ducks, see. There wasn't so many 
wood ducks but yet there was wood ducks. Anyhow, we went to work 
and when they put that impoundment there, 
let the water come out, 
let the salt water in, 
see — killed every spear of grass, every 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 183 
spear they wiped out. And them fish that was 
in there, 
it was 
catfish musta been by the million, and the sunfish - they have 
different names for sunfish, you know, wherever you go, 
different things, bluegills and all kinds of -well, they have 
some bluegills there too, very few, I think they cleaned'em out, 
cause sunfish is what we have. So anyway, Freddie killed 
everything. And he got them ducks - how many thousands of ducks a 
year he's done that, this country out of I don't know, but many 
of a thousand. 
GH: Who's this Freddie? 
BL: He's the head one of the whole thing. Thousands of acres 
right down here next to our meadow and all, he's got charge of 
it 
all. And he must be getting 
GH: Does he work for the government? 
BL: Yeah, thirty four thousand dollars a year I think he's getting 
- he's getting more'n that now you know, and he's got charge of 
the whole thing and it's all 
dope. We was - last Summer, not this 
Summer now, but a year ago now, I went and talked with the man. 
And his wife was there, and I said well, you won't see us no more 
- cause I was there every morning, we'd go before daylight and I 
was there. Right down back of Freddie's place. They wasn't in 
Atlantic County - we didn't see'em if they was. Anyhow, they 
didn't have no fishing tackle or anything, but they had this, 
just like I got out there, a cooler about like this was on the 
back seat, that they put things in. And I wouldn't dare let 
it 
get out, see, what I know 
Let's see, 
it was all over in 1930. Before that, you know, when 
that Lindberg baby was kidnapped, they took all 
the boats, see, 
they took four boats that night. See, every coast guard, big one, 
every one of the state cops, the big guys, all paid, see. They'd 
never touch you, you could go all 
night long. After two o'clock 
in the morning. Before two o'clock you couldn't make a move, 
they'd pull you. But after two o'clock - Charlie Goodman was the 
man's name, now I knew him well, he come to our house during ( ), 
he had the Blue Haven night club 
in Atlantic City. That could be 
traced back, one thing and another, and you really see what big 
times was, you know. They woulda brought two thousand cases one 
night, four boats come 
in there at Jakes Landing and unloaded. I 
went to working - Jake come to me 
lots of times wanting me to go on 
the boat, I could tell 
you exactly what happened, how they done 
it. 
They had a big ship, a big one, ocean liner, thousands of 
tons, and they'd load her, bring her here. Government got a 
twenty mile limit, she had to 
lay outside of that. They had these 
fast speedboats'd come 
in - I don't even know the name of'em -
the Nipponese was the biggest one they had. Some of'em had as 
much as four of them airplane motors into'em, so they'd go 40, 50 
mile an hour. Anyway, when this big boat, when she'd go 
load, 
she'd be gone a month. And went up to the mouth of the St. 
Lawrence River. There's an island up there, they say, a real 
French island. And they loaded. See, they had to have so much 
water and grub and fuel, not only the thousands of cases of 
liquor and stuff they brought down, see. And the two principal 
things they brought were, they brought Ne-plus-ultra, awful good 
scotch whiskey. They called it Buchanan scotch, 
in a short dumpy 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 184 
bottle like this. And then Golden Wedding, and ( ) with the two 
ryes, pints. And they had 14, 
16 ounce bottles ( ) they had all 
kinds. 
GH: And then they shipped'em to Atlantic City? 
BL: Well, when they come 
in, 
they'd bring in these small boats 
that is, four hundred cases I think the boat would carry. These 
other fellows, friends of mine, well my brother had one boat. And 
he'd tow it, 
see, 
like a scow. My God, why they'd go work 
in 
a, 
work for a month or so every night it was fit, and then this boat 
had to go away, and load. And that whole gang had been ( ), 
you 
know, they wouldn't believe it, and you know what they done. They 
had what they called a schooner, a smaller boat — she only held 
three, four thousand cases, and for that time they'd spread it 
out — they'd only use one boat of four hundred cases, and they'd 
go working about once a week, they go working, polling somewhere 
with 
it 
like that, to keep the gang together. If 
it didn't they 
just ran all 
night — they'd start at sunset and never quit until 
daylight. Thinking something's going to go wrong. I had a friend, 
had people 
in his family, one thing and another — but I was 
fishing and all, oh man I saw plenty going on. Like that night they 
come and got me out of bed. They knew what I knew, how to bring 
that boat in — they didn't tell me, but I surmised. But you know, 
about a month later they give me sixty—five one dollar bills. We 
never believed — my Dad, he wouldn't have nothing to do with 
it, 
see. But the Henderson boys, they even hijacked'em down here, 
people from Philadelphia when they came over — oh, they tried to 
kill'em. They had boats with glass on them, and everything else 
you know. 
GH: What was your dad's name? 
BL: My dad? Same as mine — William. 
GH: Are you a .junior? 
BL: Yeah. Listen, I'll 
tell 
you something that people don't know, 
but I got two names. My name 
is supposed to be William Charles 
Lee. When I got married I went a got my birth cent— no, 
it wasn't 
when we got married, 
it was when I got my operator's license, to 
operate a boat to carry passengers — for hire, you know, I had an 
eight ton boat, a document(?) boat. And there wasn't no William 
Charles Lee there. The surmise 
is — my Dad was dead and my Mother 
was dead — but my Mother's dad, my granddad Chanson(?) name was 
Charles, so she named me after my dad William and Charles, her 
dada, see. He never turned it 
in that way — he just put plain 
William Lee. And I never knew it until I was about 20—some years 
old. And 
it was when I went to get the birth certificate, you 
know, I had to get my operator's license, there was no such a 
thing. So my mother died thinking my name was Charles and here 
I've got the two names. Well you see, 
I've only got one thing I 
signed William C. Lee, and that's the insurance. And the rest of 
everything is just plain William. Cause I turned around and 
caught up with 
it when I found out, course 
it was many a year ago 
now, why I dropped the C right quick. But I do, I got two. 
GH: When you finish this are you going to set it out for snapper? 
BL: Well, I will but I've got six or seven of them. Are you gonna 
be around anytime? 
GH: Just a few more days. 
BL: I was gonna say, 
I'll 
get you one of my flights and give 
it 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 185 
to you, 
let you take 
it. 
GH: Great. 
BL: 
It's all fixed, already set. Got five or six of 
'em. 
GH: 
Is 
it here? 
BL: No, 
it's — see we don't live here. Course, see, they broke 
into our trailer seven times — the guy's 
in state prison now, 
name of John Gandy, supposed to be a good friend of ours, a young 
feller in his teens. And so my wife's scared, she won't stay down 
there at nights. Got to bring her up here nights. But we're down 
there all 
along, we been down there twice, down fishing, and we 
had to go wood—buying, she had a lot of things you know, and has 
the feller(?) 
in Delmont. 
GH: 
Is that where your place 
is then, Delmont? 
BL: Yeah. We owned one piece with a hundred and twenty acres, a 
mile long all 
this side of the Moore's Beach Road. So that 120 
acres, we just sold 
it to Summers Hedley, his bunch — that's his 
name (unintelligible). Then we sold twenty acres to our niece and 
nephew. And then we sold the house and the trailer with about a 
half acre there right on the road. We still got forty, fifty 
acres, where our trailer's on up there now, comes clear out to 
the church. That was a mile long, we owned practically everything 
on that side of Moore's Beach Road, every tree, 
if you ever went 
down there — and there's millions of trees down there. 
GH: I was down there last winter to see the geese. 
BL: Them white geese? My god, how they come there. Yup, on the 
left, that blue and white trailer's ours. And every tree that you 
see down there, from the road to Moore's Beach is on us. And we 
just sold all 
that down there. That last island way down there 
with the beach on the left sticking out there? Haystack Island — 
that's ours. Or was, but I just sold it. And he's a wonderful man 
— they've got that. Now where the chain's across the road there, 
where you saw ( ) trailer, see, that's our road that goes 
in. My 
dad 
GH: Could I come down to visit some time? This weekend? Are you 
going to be going out fishing? 
BL: Yeah. I go every day, seven days a week. 
GH: How about Sunday morning? 
BL: Let's see — today's Thursday. Yeah. Eleven o'clock to twelve, 
we'll be down there to tend that net. Each one, just before noon 
and just before midnight. But you can't see anything 
in the 
night. 
GH: 
I'd like to take some pictures if I could. 
BL: Well you can come down there — you come down to Moore's Beach 
But you've been down there so you know. You come right to the end 
of the road, turn to your left, and you come down to where it's 
ours, on the beach, ( ) over, my net's right there. You just step 
out and 
look and there 
it 
is, 
throw a stone right out to 
it. You 
come down there at eleven — let's see, Friday, Saturday — you 
come down there at eleven o'clock, 
it's 
low water at twelve to 
one, 
right in there, but I'm mostly down there ahead of 
it. 
But 
you'll see me right down there, I pull up right there on the... 
GH: Do you need waders to get out? 
BL: Well 
if you went out to the net you'd need waders but christ 
you can stand there and 
look — she sits there and waits — you can 
throw a stone out to me. I don't have to have my glasses but I 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 186 
take my glasses and look and I can count the fish 
in the net 
before I go out. 
GH: OK, 
I'll 
be there then on Sunday, and then maybe you could 
show me your fykes afterwards. 
BL: 
I'll 
go to work and I'll 
get you one of them fykes — every 
mesh I made'em myself — just like this, every one of them meshes. 
They don't think you can do 
it, see, they say well, that's made 
by a machine. You saw how it was made. 
GH: You don't need to use a gauge? 
BL: No — oh I usually just guess at 
it. 
GH: Just kind of eyeball 
it. 
BL: Look. I done every one of'em. 
GH: So, that'll hold a snapper of fifty pounds? 
BL: My god there's no way to break 
it — that's a hundred and 
fifty pound test. Oh, you couldn't break 
it, I don't care how 
hard you pull. I guess that's close to two hundred pound test — 
that's twenty — one, or four thread, nylon. 
GH: So the snapper can't bite through it? 
BL: No, not that. But they don't bite the twine anyway. You'd 
think they would but they don't. I used to use fifteen thread 
cotton. See, fifteen or eighteen thread cotton I used to use. 
GH: Have you ever gotten bit by a snapper? 
BL: Oh no I done, one day — I was getting'em where they laid their 
eggs — that's one thing about my dad, 
he wouldn't let me set 
snapper fyke but I could go get'em right off their nest, while 
they was laying their eggs you know. I had three or four snappers 
in this bag. I was throwing'em on my back, didn't one of'em nail 
me 
in the middle of the back. Know what I done — ran out from 
underneath the bag — dropped it and took off a hole off my back. 
So we went to work and a thing come out and stuck out there, see, 
about fifty year later. Well anyway, they always wanted me to go 
have 
it cut off and I never did. Anyhow, this day I climbed a 
tree — they wanted me to rent a piece of meadow down there, and I 
climbed a tree, a cherry tree 
it was, wild cherry. So I took 
ahold of a limb and this thing bent over and when 
it did I bent 
with 
it 
like that, and the middle of the limb caught me 
in the 
middle of the back, broke that thing right off. All healed up and 
disappeared. 
GH: You're as good as new now? 
BL: Yeah, I never felt better in 
the world. But you know what I'm 
afraid of? I'm afraid I'll overdo it. You know when you get 
eighty, you don't know how much you can stand — I don't know, 
maybe I'm doing as much as I used to. 
It's more work for me out 
there — that net, and it's as 
if I had a boat. See, when you have 
a boat — I got all 
that fish 
in the boat, and people — they can't 
do 
it. I can go out there, blowing twenty mile an hour wind, seas 
like this, pull 
right in fair wind and sit down, overhaul my net, 
and when I get my net overhauled it's all overboard fishing again. 
All 
alone. No work at all 
to 
it — pull(?) fair wind. You can't do 
it with an 
inboard motor, but with the outboard motor you're 
ready to dump'em just right down over your net. None of the rest 
of'em can't do 
it. 
They can't catch these fish. When I was last 
fishing I'd be catching four or five hundred pound every day. 
GH: Where do you sell your fish? 
BL: Right down here at Bailey around the road. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 187 
GH: Bailey. 
BL: Bout four or five mile down the road here on the left — 
Bailey's fish market near Port Elizabeth you know. 
GH: I have one more question about the rails. Are they different 
sizes and colors? Are they different kinds or just one kind? 
BL: That's one thing I don't know anything about hardly, 
is your 
railbird. That was the river, and our rails are the copper rail — 
that's the big one you know. Then the little one, there's a 
little one and a big one of them — we always called'em mudhens. 
GH: They got the long beaks, right? 
BL: Yeah. I went down to the crik last winter, New Year's — state 
property, set a couple dozen traps. And I had to catch about 
fifty mudhens before I could catch a muskrat. Every time one goes 
in, 
he's dead. I didn't bring'em out, the season was out, 
so I 
throwed'em up on the bank you know, 
like that, and I cleaned all 
of'em up down there before I catch a muskrat. 
GH: Do you eat the rail birds then? 
BL: Oh, they're good, they're awful good eating. 
GH: The ones you were catching were the little clappers? 
BL: Oh they weren't the clappers, the big rails down there. 
GH: They were getting in the muskrat traps? 
BL: Yeah, down there, the holes where the muskrats keep 
it open 
you know, well t 
h 
e 
y 
' 
s right in there, that's where they get their 
feed, see. They have to have 
it open you know to get feed. The 
muskrats had 
it open. Well I went to work and after I caught them 
I caught a few muskrats. There wasn't many there, but I did, I 
caught a few muskrats there. 
GH: That was frozen over? 
BL: Oh, the meadow was frozen over solid. Just before the tide 
raised and failed and the crik was open, see. And I got the holes 
down there underneath with these Conibear traps. The leghold 
traps, you can let'em go — many and many of a duck I've caught 
and all 
() nice, and cut his leg off where 
it was broke — if 
it 
wasn't broke too bad you know, 
I'd out it off. If 
it wasn't broke 
at all, 
I'd just take it out of the trap 
But they're trying to 
stop the leghold trap you know. That's one of the worst things 
that ever happened, to specially the kids. Now to me — course I 
don't set it out ( ) there, I would say 
it would stop'em. You 
know why? 
Well, right here, kids, and people, even grown people, working, 
they set their trap, right in a person's dooryard, to catch their 
raccoon or a skunk or a possum, whatever it 
is you know — not 
muskrats. Up on the upland, you know — sometimes they won't tend 
that trap until Saturday and Sunday. And the kids, you can't 
( ) 
kids what they'll do anything about it you know. It's a dirty 
rotten shame. Now look, I set about ten traps each year for 
raccoon. I don't believe I'll 
average over one or two raccoon a 
year that's alive. I set my trap and drown him right there, see. 
But other people don't do that. They set'em up on the upland, you 
know. I use eel 
and bunker, see, salted. I use a stake, about 
that high, and right in the middle of the way I put my bait. Down 
further, I set my trap. And that is out where it's this deep. 
Never put it up on the upland. And the raccoon comes along and 
he's gonna have that bait. Then he gets caught and he goes around 
the stake and he drowns, right there. I caught 24 coon, I think 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 188 
it was five traps I had set. 
GH: So they die quickly that way? 
BL: Oh, yeah. Don't even gnaw things down. Now when I was a boy, 
I done like the rest. I set about twenty five, thirty traps, go 
for a mile across the woods you know. And I caught a lot of 
rabbits, 
lotta quail, lotta pheasants, 
lotta squirrels. And I 
also caught a lot of possum and skunk, you know, I got five 
dollars apiece for skunk, fifty cents apiece for possum. Nowadays 
you can't sell a skunk. 
GH: Five dollars for a skunk? 
BL: Five dollars for a skunk. 
GH: What do they use'em for? 
BL: Oh, the fur made the nicest fur coats there is. But now, they 
won't buy'em, people won't. There's sales for'em, you send'em 
away, get a dollar apiece for'em or something like that. 
GH: There's no scent on the fur? 
BL: Not when they get through with it - there's scent when you 
get it. Man, I've had it all 
over me before now. I got a mouthful 
once. Had 
it 
in my eyes. 
GH: And lived to tell about it. Well, that's great, OK - I think 
I'd better go now, and I'll 
come down on Sunday. 
BL: 
Now look, 
if you come down there, I'll 
be looking for you. 
Don't come down before about eleven o'clock, and I'll 
be down 
there . 
GH: Moore's Beach, right at the end of the road, on the beach. 
BL: Yeah, when you start right down that road, you look on the 
left and there's a trailer there, that's my trailer. 
GH: So your trailer's back up from the beach, but there's no 
trailer down on the beach? 
BL: Yeah, I'm right there on the woods. Soon as you start down 
the road, first bend, on the 
left you'll see a blue and white 
trailer. You'll also see a chain across the road right there, 
where our road goes 
in. 
All 
them trees on that side - everything 
is ours, when you come out to the big field (unintelligible) 
GH: So I'll meet you all 
the way down at the far end. 
BL: You meet me at the beach - as I say, you drive up to the 
beach 
BL: I hate seeing down there. 
GH: So why did they do that? They were trying to stabilize the 
beach? 
BL: They was just trying to stop that break in the bank 
GH: Did Ezra cause the break? 
BL: Well 
no, that ( ) always having a break, see, but like I say, 
all 
you'd have to do 
is put a piece of wire and backing, the waves 
would build up over top of'em, good for fifty year. 
GH: You know George Campbell has been diking a lot of his fields. 
BL: But you know there's no beach down ( ) of Campbell's? You go 
down there and there's no beach, just elder and hawsedge, all 
kinds of grass, 
like that. But it don't wash away you know. Big 
tide'II come across his meadow down there. And then run on to 
(perigee). We got two of'em in July, two (perigees). 
GH: So that's the highest - the perigee. 
BL: That's a fast raise on the high one and fast out on the 
low 
one. A pogee - 1 still call 
it pogee - that's not very high and 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 189 
not very low. 
GH: And slow? 
BL: Right — it's slow moving, 
lazy. 
GH: 
Is the perigee tide, 
is that when the moon is full? 
BL: Well my god, christsakes, they got the perigee tide on the 
quarter. You wait just a minute, I'll get my... 
GH: Now back 
in March they had a big storm that tore things up 
pretty badly out there. 
BL: Let's see — June. This moon — the tide. Now look, at nine 
o'clock standard time, right down there on Moore's Beach — beach 
point they say, but all 
along there — now look, now this's on the 
full moon, or new moon — see, full/new — at high water, at nine 
o'clock standard time. Can you remember that? Alright. Each 
quarter is 
low water at nine o'clock standard time, see. Now 
then, 
in between, we call 
it an hour later each day, the tide. 
Three—quarters of an hour, exact. And that's how you tell 
tide. 
Your counter, see 
GH: So you count back from... 
BL: You just look right here, see. 
GH: And that's the way 
it 
is, 
right down there at Moore's Beach. 
BL: Simplest thing in the world, and nobody knows it. You can 
take a hundred people down here and I bet you you won't get two 
of'em that knows it. No, that's right — those are all 
alike. 
GH: So did you figure that out yourself? 
BL: Oh no, when I was a kid, you know, everybody knew. Everybody 
worked the water. 
GH: They didn't need one of these. 
BL: No, well, everybody had one. This is a old almanac, see. 
GH: Yeah, I guess that goes way back. 1792. 
BL: Sure. Yes sir, my dad, he'd go over it and he'd turn to my 
mother, he said, when do I plant this. She'd look and — her dad 
was an old farmer, see. And he'd have to ask my mother. Now 
listen, the red skin potato and the white potato, that's for 
winter. You plant that after full moon — this 
is the sign, 
it's 
in 
the next one down. Now I don't know about that, but anyhow, 
you had to wait till full moon. Now the full moon 
is the first day 
of July, you could plant'em the next day. You plant'em before, 
they'd go to vine and you wouldn't get any potatoes. She knew 
that, and he didn't. But she'd tell him. His folks had nubs(?) on 
em, 
they were ( ) — he had the prettiest one 
in the world. You 
may not believe it, 
but I had...

BT: Well, I just — around our blueberries we have one there 
that has five or six seeds in 
it, 
big ones, and I always 
considered those to be the real wild huckleberries. And the other 
ones to be the blueberries, with the small seeds, you couldn't 
see'em . But most people call — my father calls blueberries, 
huckleberries. 
GH: Wild blueberries are huckleberries? 
BT: No, he calls the ones he grows huckleberries. 
GH: Oh really? Some of the local people don't seem to make that 
distinction. The botanists have been trying to sort it out 
according to their distinction, but... everybody seems to use it 
in a slightly different way. 
BT: And 
if 
I've got any training at all 
in blueberries, 
it's from 
someone with a science background. A neighbor of ours was Marie 
Coville Thompson — and her grandfather was Frederick Coville, and 
she has a lot of the family papers and she showed me that 
business. 
GH: You mentioned that last October and I still haven't had a 
chance to follow up on 
it. He did some interesting work out 
west.. 
BT: Death Valley. He has notes, stuff like that. She has his 
basket collection, that he got, and she has a rope, that he 
wrapped himself 
in 
to keep the rattlesnakes off him. 
GH: That's a curious one. 
BT: So I'm going up there 
in the spring to do some copy stand 
work. I'm doing a presentation — I think 
in February or March — 
on the history of the blueberry for the Historical Society. So 
I'm going to gather all 
the notes and finally getting out to do a 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 191 
little bit of fieldwork. 
In the fall I did a bit at Penn(?) for 
the old growers on how they started their fields, where they got 
the stock. My great uncle — slow down up here — the third, oh 
make a left, you'll see a driveway. My great uncle had a 
blueberry that he hybridized. He was Herbert Beebee — one of the 
first people 
in the co—op, those early people that got together. 
And he did a lot of cuttings for a lot of the fields around 
Retreat(?), and sold them. 
GH: What was the brand or variety that he developed? 
BT: Beebee. No 
it's a Herbert — the first name. 
GH: So how many varieties are there now that are recognized? 
Thirty or forty? 
BT: Oh, yeah. And I think we have six or seven varieties. 
GH: That you plant. 
BT: Yeah. 
GH: 
Is there any way of copyrighting your variety? 
BT: I don't think there 
is. And I don't — my research hasn't been 
enough yet that I can understand what has made one cultivar 
different than the next. Seemed to me that you could take a whip 
and start your own variety real easily. But they seem to have 
enough genetic difference that you can tell'em 
apart. These two 
fields are Bluecrop. 
GH: That's the name of the variety? 
BT" The variety. And there's two things nice about these. One is 
they crop 
in clusters. And two, they don't have many leaves. So 
that means your pickers can make a good bit of money doing this, 
and they don't mind picking them. 
GH: Do you pick by hand? 
BT: Right. We do 
mostly hand picking. 
BT: This 
is the packing house my dad built. And I guess it's 
about thirty or forty years old now. And 
it stays 
GH: Cedar. 
BT: Yeah. And I don't know if he got it from my grandpop or not — 
my grandpop had a cedar sawmill, or a sawmill and cut cedar. I 
don't know if 
he was 
in business at that time or not. For some 
reason, 
it stays about 75 degrees throughout the summer in there. 
Have a concrete floor, and then the double story, and this 
downstairs is just perfect — to the point that people 
in the co— 
op think we have a refrigerator that we put our blueberries in, 
that they come that cool. When they get there. 
GH: So it gets like 90... 
BT: 90 out 
in the field, and 
if you can get the flats in here, 
and put a fan on'em, we keep'em 70 degrees. They start breaking 
down once they get any higher than that. 
GH: How long do you keep'em in packing sheds? 
BT: At least till 
two or three 
in the afternoon. And people are 
starting around six or seven. You don't really have trouble 
in 
the field until around twelve. 
GH: When will you have people actually picking out here? 
BT: We'll have people — yeah, Wednesday probably. It's hard to 
say. We'II take a walk down there and 
look at the Weymouth, there 
might even be some ripe ones. 
GH: Weymouth is another variety? 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 192 
BT: Right. 
GH: From down south of Hammonton? 
BT: 
'They must be, cause that's the name down there, and it's 
probably a family name, after a town, and no doubt out of that 
area. 
GH: I noticed some blueberry fields down there. Yesterday. Course 
there's a lot around Hammonton. 
BT: Yeah, there are. 
GH: 
Is 
it still expanding, the business? 
BT: I don't think 
it 
is. And we'll see today, probably the 
nemesis to the blueberry fields. And sheep pen hill disease just 
might wipe some people out 
GH: So when was this first discovered? 
BT: 
It's been fifteen or twenty years old, but it's gotten really 
bad the last few years, and there's some fields that are just 
wiped out. 
GH: Sheep pen hill disease. 
BT: 
It started at Sheep Pen Hill. 
GH: That's somewhere around here I guess. 
BT: Right, 
it's a small 
little place outside of New Lisbon. The 
problem with blueberries is 
it's 
labor intensive and capital 
intensive. And to pass it on to your children, you have to be 
in 
a financial situation that you don't need the capital you have 
invested 
in the blueberries. I would say that this field here is 
probably worth 125,000 dollars. 
GH: Just the land? 
BT: The orchard. I don't know if the land's worth that — that's a 
whole different bag of tricks now with the comprehensive 
management plan. I say, you put a nice little environmental 
design over there in the Weymouth block, do a nice little patio, 
pool thing here with the cabana house, and you can get 200,000 
dollars from someone who wants to get back to nature. But that's 
— you know, again, I think the comprehensive management plan can 
work both ways 
in protecting your land value. But nonetheless, 
there's a considerable amount of money here. And to be able to 
pass 
it on to someone else, you know, 
it's not gonna be easy. And 
if 
the sheep pen hill disease 
is gonna start ruining the stock 
that you have planted, you know, you're gonna be out of business. 
And I think the co—op's at a very serious stage right now. 
Because most people in there are 
in 
their fifties and sixties, 
and then the kids like me who have gone on to school, I don't see 
that they're going to be coming back. And I guess Billy Haynes 
will take over his dad's, but you know — and probably someone at 
Lee's, but the other fields look 
like they might just go into 
woods again. 
GH: So there isn't much likelihood of, 
say, General Foods or 
someone coming in? 
BT: Well, they talk about Ocean Spray doing that. Whether they 
can — this does not easily acclimate itself to agrobusiness. My 
dad has to walk down here and prune each one of these at hand to 
keep its shape, and I don't think General Mills or Ocean Spray 
have those kind of orchard men, that can do that kind of work. 
Now, this field we think, or we say, 
it could raped for five or 
six years, and still get just about what we've been getting off 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 193 
of i 
t 
GH: Raped — that's the term you use, to use 
it without car,ng for 
it? 
BT: Putting something back in 
it, 
and pruning it. We put a lot of 
time 
in this. 
I've been working every weekend now since March, 
and my dad works here all 
the time. My mother's up here every 
weekend, 
if not every day, doing something. And we 
like 
it I 
guess, cause there's really not the money in 
it for the time. Not 
that you're always looking for that, but 
GH: 
It's like the salt hay business — they were saying they 
didn't make fifteen thousand a year for those three — father and 
two sons — involved 
in the business. Which isn't enough to 
live 
on really. 
BT: Right. 
GH: Course if they can mix it 
in with other jobs 
in other 
seasons, you can 
BT: You can do al 
this, and he work 
these bluecrop we 
now, and we're gr 
pretty good. But 
blueberries in a 
true cost of your

'em a better sala 
GH: Could you tel 
BT: 
In the market 
GH: 
Is 
it 
like wi 
BT: Well, I think 
was, 
let's say, m 
of blueberries an 
were terrible is 
machine, they wer 
color of the blue 
you drop an apple 
knock blueberries 
and rotten. 
GH: Don't they sort cranberries by bouncing them? 
BT: Right, but have you seen sorted cranberries? Well, you can 
tell 
the difference between hand—scooped cranberries and sorted 
cranberries a mile away. They last about two weeks 
in the 
refrigerator. Hand—scooped cranberries we kept in the basement 
all 
winter long, and they stayed hard and fresh. You loose 
something with this mechanization. Now when it comes to 
cranberries, you very seldom eat cranberries raw, so you're not 
gonna loose too much by doing 
it that way. Other than storage, 
and who cares that you can store'em all winter. No one has a 
make a go of 
it. 
I right. My dad got another job to throw money 
in 
ed as a union carpenter, during the years while 
re growing up. And 
it seems like it's paying off 
ossing pretty good and the price 
is staying 
you can't have a traditional co—op and market 
very modern world. Because your not getting the 
berry. It doesn't seem to me you are. Ours are 
re taken right down to the market and sent to 
Iphia, up and down the coast and out west. We're 
price as Hammonton picking them on the machine, 
em. Now if 
our co—op would, could see that, and 
little fancier — gourmet blueberries, or hand— 
r — and get a little more money for it, 
it might 
while to go back 
in and prune these fields and 
ple to pick. And you might be able to even give 
ry for picking. 
I the difference readily, 
in 
the marketed berry? 
you can — I think you can tell 
it immediately. 
nes, somebody who knows the difference... 
consumers even know. They don't know that it 
achine picked, but they'll say, I got this pint 
d they were terrible. Well the reason that they 
that they were sorted off the back of the 
e bounced around, so there's a difference 
in the 
berry and how long 
it 
lasts. Like an apple — if 
on the ground, 
it's gonna get bruised. If you 
around like that, they're going to get bruised 
Hunn--$4 audiocassette logs 
page 194 
cellar anymore much. But I think people will 
pay good money for 
fancy fruit. They were paying three—fifty at Reading Terminal 
in 
the middle of winter for New Zealand blueberries, for a half 
pint. Then I think people would pay a buck and a half for a 
fresh—picked pint of blueberries. But you have to do some kind of 
marketing so people realize that that's what you're getting and 
they can rely on that pint of blueberries for being halfway 
decent. And the co—op's not really doing that. You know, when you 
talk to Denny about what's happening in the rest of the world... 
GH: Denny who? 
BT: Doyle. Manager of the co—op. He's hired by the growers. And — 
well, we'll just consider this tape classified. 
GH: Well, we can certainly do that. 
BT: OK. Well, the pecking order seems to be Bill Haines running 
the co—op with Steve Lee, and they're the big growers. Then 
there's, I think, the Gibersons, the Darnells and then we're 
in 
there s.omewhere 
in the top people. My father is very difficult to 
get along with. He's never been asked to be on the board of 
directors because he's very to the point with these people. 
GH: So how do you get asked to be on the board of directors? Is 
that voting by the members? 
BT: No, they — you're brought up at general meeting, and you have 
to be a grower, apparently, to get on there. Now my mother's the 
grower now, we put everything in her name, probably for 
inheritance reasons and whatever, thinking my father would 
probably go first, and want her to be 
in control of this. And 
then there's, 
it seems to me that there's an undercurrent down at 
the co—op, that there's the books, every grower has their own 
vote — and only one vote whether you have one acre or a hundred 
thousand acres — but there's also the telephone, and who hollers 
the 
loudest. Which plays a little bit in this. And then, there's 
also the third one, everybody went to school with one another, 
probably half of them slept with one another, they've got this 
other little network that even goes as far as Florida. The people 
know in the winter, what blueberry people are down there and they 
talk about the temperature, send word down. And my father got 
word when he was in Florida last year that the temperature in 
February dropped real quick after warm days, and that there was 
bud damage 
in 
the Weymouth, and he came right up. And this was 
down 
in Florida they were talking about it. So it's a very 
interesting.. 
GH: A lot of the growers winter down in Florida? 
BT: Yeah, they 
— or go down for a couple weeks, anyway, now. 
GH: The guy that was sitting at the general store — what's his 
name? 
BT: He just works for Bill Haines — Ernie de Stafino. And Ernie's 
a real good fellow 
GH: He's kind of field manager, of the operation? 
BT: Right. He's excellent. 
GH: Does information exchange go on at the general store? 
BT: Yeah — it's the, probab►y, the blueberry network. Ernie was 
gonna get his own fields — he was gonna buy a hundred acres and 
then leave Haynes, and he offered I think it was a hundred 
thousand dollars for the field, and then Bill came up with a 
Nunn--$4 audiocassette logs 
page 195 
hundred and fifty thousand. He bought the field and Ernie stays 
there and manages it. 
GH: Guess he doesn't want to 
loose Ernie. 
BT: That's what it 
looked like, and maybe he gave Ernie — I 
imagine he gives Ernie a lot of money. I would hope he would. And 
Bill 
and — you're familiar with the Haynes story, aren't you? 
GH: 
.Just a little, you know I missed a lot of 
it 
in the fall. 
BT: That's — Bill 
has taken family land and made an empire out of 
it, 
is virtually what has happened, and gotten his brother, 
bought his brother out. And his brother's lost a lot of family 
money with his female problems that he's had, he's on his second 
or third wife, and not the hard worker that Bill 
is, 
so Bill 
has 
gotten it all 
in his own hands now. And I guess ten thousand 
acres of cranberries and blueberries. So he's a fairly wealthy 
fellow. And the Lees are a lot smaller than that in scale, but 
nonetheless, you know, hundreds of acres. 
GH: How many acres does your family have? 
BT: Forty. 
GH: How many are right in here? 
BT: Twenty some. 
GH: So this is about half of your operation? 
BT: Right. I guess we're probably the 
last of the families to 
have a big business — now most of them were family run, the 
Peppers over here, the Eslows, there's the Browers — they had the 
same kind of operation, but never put money back 
in 
it, 
and all 
they're doing now is going through and raping'em with the machine 
for bulk market. And we've kept up, which seems to 
leave a little 
bit 
if jealousy with the people that we are doing real well now? 
GH: So 
is there competition for selling? 
BT: No — there's just competition for being better than the 
Hayneses or the Thomases or the Eslows. 
GH: The workers who'll be out here — where do they come from? 
BT: Browns Mills, Lebanon Lakes, 
lot of them are local, some come 
from Willingboro. Mostly white, some blacks from Willingboro, lot 
of young kids from the 
local school — my brother teaches there. 
GH: 
Is there an 
issue on child labor laws, that kind of thing? 
BT: Well, they all 
have working papers, so apparently they're 
within the 
law. 
GH: How young do they start? 
BT: Oh, I think you can pick when you're thirteen or fourteen. 
GH: I know they've been having debates about that in 
the 
strawberry fields out in Washington. Kids like to get out there 
and earn a little money. Strictly interpreting the 
law made 
it 
very difficult. 
BT: Well there 
is that. 
GH: Do you pay kids the minimum wage or can you pay'em less? 
BT: Well, we pay them by the flat. That's supposed to work out — 
they're supposed to be able to pick enough to make minimum wage. 
Well there, right then you're 
in a problem, cause some kids want 
to work and make a lot of money, and some kids just want to get 
away for the day and goof around. And we don't want to pay 
minimum wage. And — I don't know what you do with all 
this. I 
have, I guess, I just keep my mouth shut and just see what's 
going on, because I don't — I have a hard time with the whole 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 196 
thing and how much you pay, and I have a really even harder time 
when I'm 
in Philadelphia and consumers are complaining about the 
price of fruit and food and whatever. I don't think they're 
willing to pay the real 
cost of giving people a decent wage to 
produce food. 
GH: 
Is your labor cost a substantial part of the 
investment? 
BT: I think she said she needed a thousand dollars a day 
GH: That's your mother? 
BT: Mmhm, to keep things going, and you don't get the first check 
for a couple weeks, so you need fifteen thousand dollars on hand 
to tap. Or around that — more some days, but between five and a 
thousand dollars a day for labor. 
GH: How many workers would that represent? 
BT: Fifty, 
little lower. 
GH: So with your forty acres, you start right now with the early 
blues? 
BT: Weymouth. 
GH: Maybe we should go out and see 
it. 
BT: Yeah, we have time. 
GH: Those are 
BT: Berkeleys 
GH: How old a 
BT: About twe 
GH: And the b 
BT: No, there 
and there are 
planting — yo 
where 
if 
it was a newer way of planting you'd have'em all 
going 
through so when your picking machine comes down 
it doesn't hurt 
berries that might not be ripe. First, when they started out, and 
this was probably back 
in the twenties or thirties, they planted 
every other row something else, thinking that the cross 
pollenization would be better. So you'll have some old fields 
that'll have a lot of junk in them. And I guess part of my... 
GH: What do you call junk? The Berkeleys? 
BT: No, I guess I would call junk Rancocas, Pembertons... 
GH: These are the older varieties? 
BT: The older varieties, and some of them weren't so good, some 
of them broke down real quickly, some of them didn't have good 
color. My uncle's blueberry's a Greycrop — it's big. But it's 
flat and black. 
GH: Which one, the Beebee? 
BT: Yeah, the Herbert. 
GH: Do you still have some of those? 
BT: Yeah, they're on the other end there 
And they don't sell 
well 
on the fresh market — the consumer does not like something 
that 
is not pretty. 
GH: A blueberry's supposed to be blue. 
BT: Right, and they're — that's the bluecrop. And the taste 
difference between the Weymouth and the bluecrop, I think, 
is 
considerable. But this was hybridized for color and picking and 
crop. 
GH: So people can spare the taste 
Berkeleys? 
and then these are the Weymouth, right here. 
re the Berkeleys? 
my years. I don't remember... 
ushes keep getting larger or are these two... 
are two different cultivars, there are Berkeleys 
Weymouth. And this 
is more of the old style of 
u see you have the Berkeleys hitting the Weymouth, 
7 
Hunn--B4 audiocassette logs 
page 197 
BT: Yeah, and these older varieties are closer to 
its original 
antecedents. If you want to pick a few... 
GH: ... dots on there are the spray? 
BT: Yeah, I'm trying to think what the spray 
is this time of year 
— it's probably a fungicide or — fungus seems to be the worst 
p 
r 
 b 
l 
em of 
th i 
s 
GH: Are there different kinds of fungus? 
BT: There are — that's just not my department. But there are 
many. 
GH: How are they treated to get the poison off the berry? 
BT: The consumer takes care of that. 
GH: Not any special washing? 
BT: No. I think this has a two day half—life or whatever. And the 
sprays that you use now are 
ones that dissipate very quickly. 
GH: So these were sprayed some time ago, and this residue 
BT: Yeah, a couple of days ago. 
GH: How do you do that? 
BT: We have an airplane. I refuse to spray. There's incidences of 
cancer in the family, and I just can't see, when they have the 
money, not having an airplane do 
it. 
GH: So that would be an option, to do that by hand? 
BT: Yeah, we have the equipment to do 
it. We have a tractor that 
goes up and down and sprays, and you would always want to have 
that, 
let's say, some kind of 
insect comes 
in 
in the middle of 
the summer, that's eating your crop. Well, there's only so many 
airplanes around to do that and it might be several days before 
they get to you, and you would wanta have something to be able to 
do 
it yourself 
if 
you had to. 
GH: Let me get a shot of you standing by this Weymouth here. 
BT: 
I've been thinking about that as I talked about wild 
blueberries. When most of your summer is so 
integrated in 
blueberry harvesting, this that and the other, I haven't had that 
many wild blueberries. I doubt that my brothers had any. And I 
was more so a nature person than they were, but that's just 
because as a kid here I just walked around here and collected 
turtles and frogs and plant stalks and whatever, 
learned a little 
from that. I can't tell — I know that wild strawberries are 
better than the dumb strawberries we have today. But I can also 
tell 
you that the Weymouth and the Junes are sweeter than the 
bluecrop and the Berkeley. So there's even a great variety within 
cuitivars, and flavor. And we're gonna loose that if 
the 
consumers don't just wise up. And that's why we have such lousy 
tomatos, because people like red tomatos and not ones that taste 
good. They just don't understand. 
GH: Well, certainly with the wine industry, they've managed to 
make a considerable profit ( ) taste (unintelligible) 
BT: What I'd like to do this fall — I'm finishing my master's and 
will 
be working on Chadsworth as the land use planning area — and 
I want to 
identify some of the old fields and start getting some 
whips from the old cuitivars before we 
loose them all. And we 
just put that point down there, where there's room to put in a 
small nursery, and that way I'm fairly certain that I'll be able 
Nunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 198 
to save some of the older varieties. 
GH: Are there any programs, government sponsered, to do that? 
BT: Are there? 
GH: I know there's growing concern on a global scale about 
preserving cultivars - potatos and corn and stuff like that that 
Indians grow. 
BT: Where would you 
look 
into that? 
GH: 
I'm not real sure. I know that the UNFAO may have some 
program, but I don't know if 
that would be - the'emphasis has 
been so strongly on the latest super variety that nobody really 
cared about loosing the old traditional 
less productive plants. 
But now they're concerned that that's a genetic resource. 
BT: Of course. 
GH: I know there's seed banks - that's one way to do 
it. But I 
don't know how you'd preserve the old cu►tivars except to keep 
them growing someplace, maybe a special field. 
BT: But to know that they live generally for thirty, fifty years 
- that's a good way of preserving them until someone figures out 
what to do. From what I can see - you know you think of Johnny 
App leseed and whatever - you could do the same thing here with, 
people are always hassling me for blueberry plants. Well 
if I 
sold them old varieties, they wouldn't know that from the new 
varieties, and that would be a way of not only selling and 
keeping'em going, but the interpretation, 
if 
you gave'em a little 
pamphlet about the history of the berry to go with it, 
they would 
feel 
like they were helping 
in 
the preservation of those 
cultivars. 
GH: How do you propagate blueberries? 
BT: Well, you - let's see, one of these things, you're supposed 
to get'em in 
the spring - I mean the, cold March, before it turns 
warm--
GH: You mean those young sprouts coming out? 
BT: Yeah, the whip, we call 
them. And then, Dr. Stretch said - I 
even have 
it written up there - if you take a saw and cut 
it 
in 
half at the joints, and that apparently does cellular damage 
there and helps their survival rate, keeps it going. Now they've 
done 
it all over, my father's done it, my cousins have done 
it -
but we've bought them through my 
life, so I've really never seen 
it done. I've only seen the flat beds and people sticking in 
these little shoots 
GH: And they put the shoots 
in a bed that's specially prepared? 
BT: The bed is specially prepared -christ, 
it's peatmoss and 
sand. Now this 
is what I think 
is 
interesting, the use of 
chemicals ( ) hand rub(?) dryers. What we use now is something 
called roundup, I'm sure you've heard about that - roundup's a 
new chemical I think by Dupont, and we apply it with something 
that looks like a paint roller, and this paint roller sticks 
in a 
cylindrical tube to get the fluid on 
it, 
has a long handle, and 
you come along and hit these. And you can see where it's going to 
get this one - that was the third time we did this. 
GH: That's one of your major wee pests out here? 
BT: 
In this area it 
is. 
They should be done 
in the fall 
so the 
sap takes the poison back down to the balls down 
in the ground. 
It just throws 
it all over, they're the damnedest things to 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 199 
control. 
GH: What other wee pests do you control that way? 
BT: There's something called doddard — I don't know if we control 
doddard that way, we use chloride PC on doddard. 
GH: 
Is that in the fall also? 
BT: No, that's 
in the spring, as soon as 
it puts out a little 
shoot on 
it, 
you hit it. 
GH: Do they actually climb on the blueberry itself? 
BT: Yeah, they'll take over a whole field if you 
let'em get that 
far. And then a lot of this disease 
is transferred by the water 
in the ditches. From cranberry bogs, throwing it down this way. 
GH: Directly 
in 
the water, or taken up through the roots? 
BT: No, 
the canals — you saw the ditches around here. 
It starts 
on the hedgerow and blows 
in, 
oh god it'll blow in. These things 
just spread, these're probably patches of 
it around here... 
DV: 
...you can drink — in fact, when we was building this house 
we used to just take down there and take a cup and just dip 
it 
right in, 
and I'll still do that today. The small 
lake that I got 
right out front of the house, that's all 
spring fed. And all 
along this whole area it's all 
full 
of springs, completely 
through here. So far as 
I'm concerned, I've got one of the 
prettiest properties 
in Tabernacle Township because I have just 
about everything — I have some of the biggest trees in the 
township, I have a freshwater stream alongside, I have my own 
private lake out front — we swim in 
it — and, well I put a few 
trout in there but they never got any size, the kids'II 
go out 
there and fish. And that's another thing you know, now when I was 
a young boy, wasn't know such thing as having a rod and a reel, 
you went out a cut a limb from a maple tree and got an old cork 
and a nail 
and that's the way you went fishing — we never got any 
fish but we had a lotta fun 
(Gene: the rest of this side and beginning of side two are 
different interviewee (DV) and two other interviewers — I assumed 
you recorded over another project tape) 
BT: What I'm hoping 
is that these little balls down here can 
gather enough sap to keep them going. Sooner or later the number 
of shoots they send out'II be smaller and smaller. 
GH: The roller is attached to a tractor machine or hand held? 
BT: The roundup — it's hand applied. We just walk down. That's 
one of the balls, from the briar. Hundreds of'em down there. You 
have to go down as much as two, three feet to get'em, and they 
get caught up 
in the crown and there's really no way of getting 
them. We really don't think much of these things. 
(unintelligible stretch of tape) 
GH:...kinds of Covilles or the Coville is...? 
BT: Coville is just another kind. Catherine and Cabot were 
varieties also. Two Coville sisters and brothers. 
GH: Now it 
looks like the Berkeleys are not as far along. 
BT: No. That's something — I don't know what that one 
is. 
GH: Yeah, 
it does look different. The foliage 
is darker or 
something. Just an odd sport? 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 200 
BT: No, th,s 
is — every once 
in a while 
in the stock you get a 
weird thing or another. And I can't tell them all 
apart. I think 
I know Weymouth leaf — I think 
if you showed me a Weymouth leaf 
I'd tell 
you what it was, and June, the Berkeley and the 
Bluecrop. But other than that, I don't think I'm too good. But I 
haven't worked around these — I've only known these. And with the 
years I went away to school and wasn't working on the weekends it 
was even hard for me to tell 
the difference between a Weymouth 
and a June. And you can just see where the Junes start down 
the re . 
GH: Right. They're a little taller and darker? 
BT: A little taller and darker and these shoots are segmented, 
more so than the June — they'll have straighter whips coming up 
through it. 
GH: So they branch more regularly or more frequently? 
BT: Well, this has a thicker stalk, where the June 
is thinner and 
it'll just spill over. 
BT: They were Covilles, that we took out there. 
GH: How old were they? 
BT: 25 years — they didn't produce much, and we didn't buy new 
land 
in 
the sixties when people were speculating and whatever — 
we wanted good production. So we get pretty good per acre, more 
so than most people. We took out the Covilles because they 
weren't producing, put 
in Weymouth, for two reasons, because 
they're a good cropper and early, and you get good money. And 
two, 
so you can get a machine in and out of there. Cause you 
can't take a big machine up and down these rows. 
GH: So how old are those Weymouths, the new ones you put in? 
BT: Five, six years old? 
GH: Are they producing yet? 
BT: They are. They got frosted out last year. This year the 
Weymouth had that hot and cold weather in February, and had some 
damage done in the buds. You'd cut a bud 
in half and see black 
spots 
in there, and each one of those black spots represent , I 
guess a berry. So 
it's a bud cluster, comes out with this thing 
that the berries wrap around. You could see these little things 
in there, whether they were black or not, and tell whether they 
were hurt. 
GH: 
If they were black then they were damaged? 
BT: Yeah. 
GH: By the frost? 
BT: No, 
it wasn't the frost — warm weather in February, and the 
bud advanced a little bit, then real cold, and they couldn't 
protect themselves. 
GH: What do you do to protect against cold and frost? 
BT: We don't do anything anymore. 
GH: This patch of plants is very small and retarded. What caused 
that? 
BT: Two things caused this. My father wanted to be able to get 
the tractor in here, turn around, and go back down to the little 
ones. Cause they'll cross cultivate the small ones. And he needed 
room to turn around, because he didn't want to go all 
the way 
down to the end of the row. Originally, when this was an older 
Hunn--$4 audiocassette logs 
page 201 
field and you had so many different varieties for cross 
pollination, for whatever reasons that they had such a large 
stock, this was a road that cut the field in half, and then for 
some reason we decided that the longer rows would be better. 
GH: So 
it just didn't grow up well? 
BT: No, this was planted later after these were no 
longer small 
enough to be cultivated we filled in 
GH: So these then are just a couple of years old? 
BT: Yeah, about two year or three year roots 
in there - maybe 
these are even four, cause they came from the nursery. And they 
have a pretty good survival rate. 
GH: What about this weed here? 
BT: 
It's a grass - yeah, I should have hand hoed these. 
GH: Does 
it cause much of a problem? 
BT: Sure. 
GH: Takes nutrients. 
BT: Right. And I should have hand hoed these. I say I'm gonna do 
it each year and you run out of time. And I like to get away at 
least a day before all 
this nonsense starts. This 
is a Coville. 
GH: 
Is this an 
isolated tree that you left here for sentimental 
reasons? 
BT: No, I don't think there's any sentimental reasons towards the 
Covilles and that family. And that's a very interesting... 
GH: How do you know it's a Coville? 
BT: I would know it because of 
its being an individual 
isolated 
plant from where they were here. Had it been a Weymouth, I could 
probably look at the leaves and tell you what makes a Weymouth 
leaf, what I think makes a Weymouth plant. And I usually tell 
them by size and the shape of the bush. The 
leaf 
is a dark green, 
and 
it 
is very different than this. I think that might even be a 
coville. See the difference - it's an 
incredible difference. 
GH: Much larger leaf. 
BT: Well, not even larger, but this one's pointed, and this one's 
broader in the middle. 
BT:...married into the Coville family. So Vinton and Laurie went 
to high school together and went to Cornell together and he died 
in 
the 60s of a brain tumor. He was working the birches - that 
big cranberry area and then he had blueberries also. So those 
families got together with the Cornell and New York State 
families and south Jersey cranberry family. And there's all 
sorts 
of 
infrastructure in those cranberry families. It's something 
like watching Falconcrest. No, 
it really is, 
and there are 
instances where people married to keep this land together, and 
there's instances where - well, I know of one instance where a 
young lady has tried to get the original Haynes tracts back 
together. I don't think she'll be terribly successful at that. 
GH: By a strategic marriage? 
BT: Strategic marriage, and 
legal manipulation. When you have six 
thousand acres of blueberries and you have three siblings, 
it 
gets cut so quickly. And that I guess can knock your operation in 
third 
if 
not worse, 
if you have one big reservoir or - and no one 
seems to work together too well. 
GH: So the children don't often stay together and work 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 202 
cooperatively? 
BT: I haven't seen an instance of 
it. The Lees are probably the 
closest it comes and the Thompsons, here. 
GH: Well I guess everybody wants their own place. 
BT: I guess — I think they want to be 
in control of the resources 
and the land and the money. With the comprehensive management 
plan now, and growth being stopped, I think you have more power 
now than you did when it was developing, and people coming in. I 
think that the local politics have settled down to a great extent 
now. So Garfield de Marco runs Chatsworth they say, ( )so much 
land, and Bill has a big deal 
to do with Washington township, and 
my uncle runs Southampton township. 
GH: What's your uncle's name? 
BT: Bob Thompson. 
GH(aside): Number 16 and 17 showed the old Coville cultiver, the 
taller, 
larger leaved plant in 
its surroundings. Now we're going 
to go 
look at the June cultivar. 
GH: So what's characteristic of the Junes — slightly larger, 
taller than the Weymouth. 
BT: Taller bush, they crop well. 
GH: They don't seem quite as numerous 
in the clusters here. 
BT: Well, they were hurt with hot weather. 
GH: So that's one variable from year to year — the number of 
fruits in a cluster? 
BT: Mmhm, and that can be affected by hot weather and late 
summer, when the buds are forming for the next year, 
if they 
don't get enough water. These are usually very good croppers. 
GH: Do you irrigate these fields at all? 
BT: Did at one time, we don't any longer. We should have 
irrigation — that's a problem with state licenses and money and 
all 
that. 
GH: Where would the water come from? 
BT: Well, an underground well, and 
-the state of New Jersey 
GH: But you don't have the wells yet? 
BT: No. We have — there's enough water here, we've had irrigation 
here. And taken 
it out of the canal. 
ST: See how small they are here? 
GH: Yeah. 
BT: And then they start getting bigger down here? That might be 
something. 
GH: Because.. 
BT: The nutrients 
in the soil. 
GH: The paler soil here and the darker soil there. 
BT: I guess, that's what I'd say 
it 
is. 
GH: One thing we have in mind, that we're trying to do as far as 
an end product of this project, 
is 
to put together a guide book 
for visitors to the pinelands. Cultural and natural history. 
BT: Yeah, I'm so concerned that anytime I hear people say that 
GH: Well, we want to know what your concerns are so we can design 
it so 
it doesn't have a negative impact. 
BT: Well, one 
is, 
it's so desperately hard to get across the 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 203 
highway even now. Yesterday there was just a head—on collision 
down here and two people killed. Traditionally we had no trouble 
getting our berries to market, had no trouble with vandalism. Now 
that you get more publicity — we had two canoers here last 
Saturday looking for a bog, and saw an old dirt road, and of 
course that means, we can go back there, this 
is the woods, this 
is the pine barrens, the 
last great wilderness on the east coast. 
Someone has got to come up with a transportation scheme and a way 
of keeping people at a minimum, and protecting our right to 
continue farming. And I can't see that anyone has addressed that 
yet. 
GH: Well, I've been thinking about it. 
In part because, 
if you 
did have a guidebook, one thing it could have would be car tour 
routes that would take people to various places. But 
BT: All 
these damn tourists on the road out here 
in 
the middle of 
the summer, with everyone going to the shore and Atlantic City 
GH: But see you can direct them wherever 
BT: There's only so many good roads 
in the pine barrens. 563 is a 
major artery for the blueberry and cranberry business. 
GH: Yeah 
BT: And what I would think would be the best 
GH: What would you suggest. The point is that people — for one 
thing being a national reserve there is a mandate to educate 
people about it. 
BT: Right, and people don't educate themselves easily. And 
getting out into nature — they look at this as being a wilderness 
and not the idea that there's human habitation. 
GH: Well that would be the major point of the guidebook, to 
educate people. 
BT: The best way that I see of giving people access, 
if 
that had 
to occur, and I'm not even certain that it has to occur, but 
if 
it did. 
If you had a way of tapping fringe towns or villages, of 
having people come 
in as outsiders, to someone's house, 
like a 
bed—and—breakfast, where those people had the control of access 
of these people, and people weren't just riding roads without any 
place 
in mind and knowing where they're going, 
it would be much 
better interpretation of the pinelands and much less detrimental 
to the area here. I don't know if today we'll see the car problem 
in downtown Chatsworth, but 
if 
you were here — well, you might 
this afternoon. They start going through downtown Chatsworth 
about 2 or 3, 
to the shore. And it's a problem. And, you know, 
people talk about guidebooks or visitors center and whatever, and 
there's nothing even talked about protecting us. 
GH: Certainly that's our concern, a major concern. But, there are 
blueberry fields that are outside this core area that maybe would 
be just as 
instructive 
in some ways, maybe not. There may be 
certain areas that you or other growers could help us pinpoint, 
where you could have, you could direct people by and say, here's 
a blueberry field, where they wouldn't interfere. Keep them away 
from the places where they would interfere. 
BT: What would seem to me to be a good way of handling it, 
if a 
blueberry field's were one of your concerns — the interpretation 
would probably be best handled through a pick—your—own farm, 
closer to the fertile farms. What I would like to see the 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 204 
government doing, 
instead of constantly doing these gu,debooks 
and whatever, would be to start paying insiders to 
interpret the 
pinelands. And how you could do that would be, getting easements 
on farms that have 18th Century farm houses and whatever, and 
if 
they want to have people come 
in, 
that would be one way of 
maintaining these old farmsteads and have government money to do 
it. Might be a better way - giving people something, whether it's 
doing the brochure, or advertisement for the pick-your-own farms, 
and for that have to produce an interpretation. What I'm afraid's 
gonna happen 
is millions of dollars 
is gonna go to a building and 
a staff to 
interpret the pine barrens, and the money again is 
gonna go to outsiders, and bourgeois professionals. And that has 
been how it's been, and I can't see them changing, and just 
professionals dealing with me, and their condescension, and their 
inability to 
interpret what a pine barrens person is, I find 
really shocking with someone that has a college education. 
GH: Well, a college education doesn't guarantee very much. 
BT: 
It seems to me 
it should guarantee something. If you lived 
around here and saw that some people were living on minimal 
means, instead of 
living with people that have money, you might 
have a different interpretation of how things were. And it's a 
very gentle balance here, and some things can hurt people very 
easily. I mean, we're not gonna be hurt by this - my brother and 
I are gonna be very wealthy when this 
is 
left to us, but that's a 
minority. 
GH: Having local people do interpretation - of course you have a 
lot of problems associated with maintaining that in the 
long run 
and selecting the proper people and so forth, but I agree that 
that might be the best way to do 
it. 
BT: Wouldn't that be a quality experience, to have a list of 
people that cattail and let's say they get, to subsidize that 
maybe thirty, forty dollars for taking those outsiders out to 
cattail - that would not only 
GH: 
If they wanted to do 
it of course 
BT: Right. Might not, but for that money, and for those people 
that are marginally in the business - salt haying for instance, 
might be another way of supplementing that income - getting free 
labor, from people that want those quality experiences plus money 
for the interpretation of that. Might add a couple thousand 
dollars to their till, and help those people continue a 
traditional way of working the environment. 
GH: There's a program for - what's it called - it's kind of 
researchers, people who want a different kind of vacation 
BT: 
...people 
in this area, world is getting very small around 
here, and that they have to be a little more vocal 
or at least 
understand what's going on. Cause the way of 
life 
is threatened, 
there's no doubt about it, and traditional occupations are, 
again, threatened. And what I don't think we need 
is more people 
in cars running up and down the street. 
GH: Yeah. There has to be some hind of education. Well, maybe 
not, maybe the best thing 
is 
to keep it quiet or something but I 
don't think you can do that. 
BT: No, probably not. 
Hunn--84 audiocassette logs 
page 205 
GH: So directing peoples' attention so that their properly 
educated 
BT: But I don't think that limiting one's choices, on their farm, 
to protect open space and promote all 
this natural wonder so 
people can get 
in their cars and have leisure time at the expense 
of 
local people, 
is fair either. 
GH: 
It certainly shouldn't be at the expense 
BT: Well 
it 
is — that's what this reserve is. 
It's a way of 
protecting open space with less than fee acquisition. And then we 
promote tourism or whatever and for middle class America, the 
burden of this protection is 
on us. And I'm so militant about 
that, and I'm an environmentalist — I'd rather see 
it ruined than 
people that have money and should have the sense to realize that 
you have to pay for these things, get it for nothing. 
Environmental quality is a very expensive luxury. 
GH: 
Ideally, the people who live here should be those who benefit 
most. 
In terms at least of the preservation of the quality of 
their lifestyle. Even if not financial benefit in the sense of 
being able to 
BT: But you can't have a quality lifestyle if everything's going 
tourism. I mean there's a couple bogs down there with canoes on 
them, and 
if 
you start making money by selling your farm for a 
summer retreat for someone — I can't see how our quality of 
life 
is being protected. And the pinel ands commission is certainly not 
even considering that. The underground water is their deal. Now 
if that works out, 
to where the quality of 
life 
is preserved, 
if 
these little towns aren't inundated with people, I — maybe we 
should go down to Mrs. Busby's some Saturday night and sit on her 
front porch, where you can't here a thing from all 
the cars. 
Maybe we can call that quality of 
life. 
GH: Yeah, well, I noticed that back at New Lisbon, all 
night 
long, the traffic going past there. I couldn't believe it. Course 
it's all 
headed for the coast I guess. 
BT: 23 people at the intersection in Vincent-town have been killed 
over a ten year period. Do you know what it's 
like getting a 
tractor across a major highway when all 
the tourists think about 
is getting down to Atlantic City? Or the shore, or the canoers? 
GH: People is the ultimate source of the problem. 
BT: But the awareness — that's to me where I think education 
needs to be, that driving your car 
is a detriment to the 
environment in New York, Philadelphia area. And do you see 
anything done about getting busses down to the shore? Trains to 
the shore? Private car, a massive drain of fossil fuel, and then 
again we have to promote a quality environment for these people? 
BT: This 
is a screen for sorting blueberries that were hand 
knocked(?). You put them in here and they roll down and then you 
could sort them with this screen. You were getting the green ones 
out and dirt was falling through the screen and the sticks. Then 
when we got electricity, our generator, we hooked fans up, 
and 
fans would blow the leaves off the screens and whatever, and just 
pull 
them through. 
GH: Defective berries you try to sieve(?) out that way? 
BT: Yeah. There's some rotten ones. There weren't too many. 
Hunn--$4 audiocassette logs 
page 206 
GH: Do they get worms in'em at all? 
BT: No (unintelligible). And there are all 
the trays around ( ) 
cedar ( ). 
I'll show you the machines that we have. These are 
baskets for knocking. Our machines are really old. The machines 
are retreat(?) and this 
is here. There's a gadget that knocks 
blueberries into this basket. And you open the flap and then you 
put it 
in a box, and then they're processed berries. 
GH: So these are empty, not out in the field. 
BT: Yeah, for right now. 
GH: But you put'em under the bushes and that's how they harvest 
them, directly into these. 
BT: Yeah, the bush fits right into that. 
GH: And then they roll down there. So you don't use these hand 
flaps anymore. 
BT: Well, we use those for hand picking. Two different processes 
GH: So this is for mechanical picking? 
BT: Right. Which is 
in between fully mechanical and people. We 
can actually pack these — it's so gentle on the berry. 
GH: How are they actually shaken — how do you shake a bush? 
BT: Well, 
I'll 
show you when we get to retreat, OK? Just remember 
this frame. 
GH: What do they call these, just the baskets? 
BT: Yeah, that's what we call them, the baskets. Those are trays, 
and these are kneelers. When the bishop closed the little 
Episcopal church that my family was from, I took most of the 
altar things up to Trenton. I asked for the benches, and they 
threw in the kneelers. So we used the benches, but we haven't had 
an evening prayer for so 
long — there's really no need for 
kneelers. 
GH: You don't use'em in sorting then? 
BT: No. 
GH: 
Irregard(?) trays, eh? 
BT: I thought that I would save the kneelers and when things get 
to such a point that there's no food, and I can decide who gets 
the food and who doesn't, the consumers that ruined the 
environment, they can be on bended knee and petition me for food. 
BT: ... always

nice little village, and they were close to every 
thing. But now that the traffic is getting so bad, and the makeup 
of Vincenttown is changing so, this 
is starting to 
look 
attractive — because there's still that sense of community and 
old families in Chadsworth. Still a bit 
in Vincenttown, but not 
like 
it used to be  
 It's really fun to have, to know 
everyone, two or three generations, too. 
GH: That's not something that I've ever experienced. 
(lots of strange noise but nothing intelligible) 
GH: These were specially designed for blueberries? 
BT: Yeah, and 
if we have time I'll take you to the repair shop 
in 
Vincenttown, that does a lot of blueberry work, and they make up 
a lot of these things. You would pull this string, and that works 
as a hydraulic (noise) So what you got 
is 
it flying up (noise) 
GH: Weeds all 
the grass? Briars and whatnot? 
BT: Right. It's not as good as hand hoeing of course, but it 
Hunn---$4 audiocassette logs 
page 207 
comes pretty close (noise) 
what you're doing 
is trying to control the most with the least 
amount of money. And this does a pretty good job. Then 
if 
you 
have a particularly tough part of the field, that has a complete 
patch of briars like the ( ), 
we might go out there by using the 
round mower(?) and 
if that doesn't take care of 
it and the bushes 
are threatened, we might go up there and hand clip 
it. 
All 
the 
work 
in the twenties and thirties like this was done by hand. 
GH: Would it be possible to totally do away with the spray? How 
much would you have to raise the price to do that? 
BT: I don't know how much we'd have to raise the price. And I 
don't know how disease prone the bluecrop are. Would seem to me 
that if I had blueberries and was trying to do that, I would go 
back to every other row, or every few rows, of a different 
variety, thinking that that would be some kind of natural 
control. I don't know what — I know that there's different 
insects for different trees, or they seem to get

GH: Now this area 
is being prepared for a new park—it? 
BT: You see we don't have busloads coming in any more, we have 
carloads of people coming 
in 
GH: Of workers. 
BT: Right. So they've been parking along the canal, and that just 
wasn't good. 
BT: Blueberries was a way of supplementing your income as 
it 
first came on. So people would get enough money together to put 
it three rows of blueberries, and then they would get three more, 
and then they would get an old cranberry bog and plant all 
that. 
And my grandmother's generation started that way. 
GH: So with blueberries you can do 
it a little at a time? 
BT: Exactly, (with cranberries) you had 
to get a lot of money 
together. So blueberry people could work up and work into 
it, and 
that's what they did, many of them. Specially my grandmother's 
generation, now my father's generation was a little different. 
Plants were a little cheaper, they weren't quite as rare, and my 
dad had money from the war that he brought back and he could 
invest in them. 
It was more labor intensive. Now, given the price 
of machinery and all 
that, 
it's more capital 
intensive. Still not 
as bad as cranberries, cranberries are horrendous. 
GH: 
In terms of? 
BT: Money, to get a bog. 
GH: 
Is 
it still 
important to control the headwaters of the 
streams? 
BT: Yeah> 
GH: So blueberries is now, I understand, about four or five times 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs

the total gross value around here as cranberries? 
BT: More than cranberries? I find that hard to believe. However, 
there's not that many cranberry people here, when you think about 
it 
GH: You mean the acreage? Do you know what the figures are? 
BT: Well, we're gonna stop at the co—op — they'll have that, or 
they'll have a little of that anyway. 
GH: But 
in terms of, say, the cultural emphasis in this part of 
South Jersey, you'd say cranberries and blueberries are about 
equally important?

BT:..cranberry people live. Give you an 
idea how, traditionally, 
this went on. They lived 
in the village and went out to the 
hinterland and did their business, and this happened in 
Metric(?), Vincentown and Pemperton. Something happened - people 
started wanting to 
live on the farms, so Bill Haines lives out 
in 
Hog Wallow now. 
GH: That's kind of a new innovation? 
BT: Yeah. Miss White lived - Miss White was the first to go out 
and 
live, at White's Bogs. And that was considered odd. I think. 
GH: 
Is this actually pine barrens here? 
BT: 
It switches - this 
is the inner-outer coastal plain, 
transitional area. 
GH: 
Is this wheat field? 
BT: I think so. And around Budtown you gat quasi-fertile soils, 
you have some farms. And over there 
is Retreat where our 
blueberry farm is, 
and you have the white sandy soil. So there's 
an 
interplay here. 
GH: Kind of 
like a checkerboard, or 
is there a hard boundary? 
BT: More like fingers. Fingers in a line. I think the fingers go 
in a line. 
GH: On our way up, just before we came to the highway, are those 
abandoned cranberry bogs out there? 
BT: Yeah - they're coming back. I don't know the family story -
they're the Buds', and they live 
in Pemberton. Buds ( ) 
GH: We also passed a couple of you-pick blueberry places - is 
that, a more and more popular option, or 
is that just 
BT: Well, there's two reasons. It's a popular option, you don't 
have to - look at that English barn, 
isn't that beautiful? - it's 
a popular option if 
you're near people. It's not so popular in 
downtown Chatsworth because there aren't that many people yet 
that come out that way. There are a few pick-your-owns along 563. 
No, you don't have to pay income tax on that money, so that's why 
it's popular. 
GH: Why's that - because there's no way they can keep track of 
your income? 
BT: Exactly. 
GH: Legally your not supposed to? 
BT: I could make a lot of money if I just went around and 
reported all 
the farmers around here and got that five or ten 
percent. I'd be shot by the next season. But it 
is a way of 
GH: How does the income compare, with you-pick and doing your 
own? 
BT: I think it's great - 55 cents a pound. There's no 
labor 
involved and no supplies involved. See, what I should do 
is I 
should figure out what we get per pound, between packaging it and 
sending it to Trueblue, to get a comparison. I'll 
do that with my 
thesis. But with you-pick-it, gives those people more money, 
it 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 211 
seems to me, and less income tax to pay, and more return on their 
investment, and makes them less apt to sell. This 
is the thriving 
metropolis of Budtown. I used to 
live down here. 
GH: Budtown — Monk's Hat Road. Just down this road now? 
BT: Yeah. We'll 
go back into town and I'll 
introduce you to Mr. 
Haggerthy, that does a lot of the repair work, and comes up with 
the gadgets. I'll 
show you where some of these people live. You 
don't generally think of Vincentown as being southern, but as I 
study more and more, and listen to some of the accents and see 
the way people live, I think of 
it more as southern now than a 
Yankee lifestyle. And there's even a few instances of — well, the 
Haines' have all the family silver and whatever from old 
generations back. They live a fairly luxurious lifestyle, 
if you 
think of 
it as being English and land—ownin 
GH: The southern aristocracy style of 
life? 
BT: Yeah. Versus the piney shack and everyone living 
in the woods 
and picking blueberries with their toes. And there 
is a wide 
variety of 
lifestyles in the area. Of the natives, I know very 
few instances of abject poverty. There are still enough resources 
to keep a fairly good level 
of 
living. From what I've seen. 
GH: Well, they say that during the depression, nobody around here 
was starving. They were better off than people who lived in town. 
BT: Even the people 
in town had kitchen gardens and do a lot of 
canning — my grandmother still cans. Christine took a picture of 
this packing shed, but it didn't turn out. But that's a nice 
small one, early, I believe. And I'll 
show you 
GH: Who's 
is this? 
BT: I don't know whose that is. And 
if we have time, we'll talk 
to my grandmother this afternoon — she's 87 and she would have 
known a lot of the early people. You know about the little brass 
plaque that they carried around with them, with the holes 
in 
it? 
GH: Nope. 
BT: There was a little brass plaque that Miss White gave the 
locals, and 
if a berry was a certain size, you got so much for 
it. You tagged the bush. 
GH: So this was with wild blueberries? 
BT: Wild blueberries is 
right. And that was the stock that Dr. 
CoviIIe used to do his science on. So 
it really wasn't — from 
what I can understand — a New Jersey berry. I don't know if they 
brought any New England ones down or not. That is something we'd 
have to ask Mari. I'd never thought of — growing up, 
of course, 
the aristocracy was the Quaker people and I'd always thought of 
myself as a peasant. There's such a vast difference in 
income 
level between a millionaire and someone just having forty acres, 
and a fairly good orchard. They were considered to be the 
aristocracy. You never thought of blueberries as being rare, or 
worthy of documentation. It's just now that I see that we're 
loosing a lot of that and want to go out of my way to get a 
program together this fall, on that. We have old fields here 
GH: Are these 
in operation here? 
BT: Yeah, they're grown up, but I think that bush — yeah, they're 
cut up, he's using those, doing something with that. You see 
those guys can rape these fields and make money off of a 
processed market — it hurts us, because they get on the co—op 
9 
- 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 212 
over there, and they don t care about keeping a fresh market 
healthy, see. They care about a good process market. Well 
this 
year they'll care, because they're quoting twenty cents a pound 
versus 60 to 70 cents a pound last year. 
GH: For blueberries? 
BT: For blueberries. And there's not gonna be people making too 
much money off of these fields. And they hurt us, and they hurt 
South Jersey. This 
is not good agriculture. They're not gonna 
leave those fields in good shape for somebody, they're gonna need 
thousands of dollars to bring these back. Just to get the trees 
out, having people walk down and cutting out trees, will take 
forever. 
GH: What kind of trees are coming up 
in there? 
BT: Well, they look 
like swamp maple, don't they? 
GH: Yeah. 
BT: 
...I don't like bad agricultural practices. And they're 
using agribusiness techniques in a labor intensive orchard. And 
you can only do that so 
long. 
GH: These are the same people 
in 
the previous generation who 
BT: Well, that guy there was a Bush, and his brother Juney Bush 
ran the co—op. He was the hand picked successor of Stanley 
Coville. They were here I think since the 1900s. They don't have 
the English background that most of the families have here. The 
Haineses of course are Quaker. Thompsons probably were Quaker 
years and years ago, but weren't quaker in — we can't call 
to 
mind when they were written out of meeting. You can with the 
Hainses. So about 1870 or 80 they were written out of meeting, 
generally for marrying an Episcopalian. 
GH: Magnolia—New Lisbon Road here. So being a Quaker means 
something more than your religious beliefs? 
BT: Oh my god— there's an old saying that's absolutely wonderful, 
when another Haines was written out of meeting for marrying an 
Episcopalian> He shook the rector's hand and said, Father I enjoy 
being an Episcopalian because, first thing I've ever found that 
didn't, interfere with politics or religion. And 
it 
is more than 
an ethnic group than 
it 
is, 
to me, a religion. And you can see, 
with the fights that my family have had with the Quakers that it 
is 
the Hatfields and McCoys versus Quakers and something else, or 
religion. They're ethnic derivations, and they kept the money and 
the 
land 
in the family. My great aunt, 
my grandmother's sister, 
no 
it was my Grandpop Thompson's sister, married a Haines out 
there near Hogwallow. And they did not have any children, and she 
died first, and the Haines' got that so that none of my great 
aunt's heirs' family would get any of that land or money, upon 
his death. Very careful about that. As we would be too. But the 
Thompson family, the cranberry Thompsons — I'm sure you've heard 
of Maryanne Thompson — don't ever mention her name or Bill Bolger 
to me. 
GH: That's a distinct branch of your family? 
BT: Well, 
let's see. Maryanne they kind of tolerate, but I think, 
I've seen very lousy things Maryanne has done to her neighbors, 
that I don't — I don't take a liking to when someone has had the 
benefit of an 
ivy—league education and 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 213 
...having money, the kids would have never gotten to school. And 
Tommy got a full scholarship to Harvard, and that helped out. But 
that's the kind of a family they are. And she has just the 
last 
two years settled the estate, of her husband. It's been fifteen, 
twenty years. And still has land, 
in that area, 
in Vincentown, 
that's not settled yet. So that's what your dealing with. 
GH: That's what happens when you go back three, four, five 
generations I guess. 
BT: You have people that still want to control resources and 
land, and that's power here, just as 
it 
is on Falconcrest and 
Dallas. Absolutely wonderful. But I can actually get an 
idea of 
what my brother's up to by watching Dallas or Falconcrest. Now 
the thing 
is the way I go through money and don't care about 
collecting it 
like they do — my brother's idea is to fix the will 
with me getting an allowance.

give you a different idea of the area. 
GH: Penn

is that where I should have turned? 
BT: Yeah. 
GH: So this is the other part of your property here? 
BT: No, we're going to go visit Bob Reeves. He's on the board of 
directors, real 
nice fellow. And he has a son that is, I guess 
retarded, but I think with a little training he could take 
it 
over. Or I'm hoping. 
GH: How many acres does — Bob Reeves is 
it? 
BT: We'll have to ask him 
Yeah, Bob Reeves. He was a bus driver. 
And blueberries are still that kind of an occupation, that you 
can subsidize if you have to. Now my father's gonna retire on his 
blueberries. 
GH: This 
is an old cranberry..? 
BT: 
It looks like an old bog. I hadn't realized it was here until 
the other day. I came out and asked Bob 
if 
it was alright to stop 
in. A lot of these people still don't have a telephone — I told 
you we didn't have a telephone, didn't I? Can you imagine running 
a business with all 
these people back here and no telephone? 
GH: You have to have some alternative means of communication 
that's more effective. 
ST: Well, what I worry about, 
is my father's from a day when 
there were not law suits as though they were an 
indoor sport. If 
someone were apt to get hurt on our bogs and there'd be a problem

with getting them to the hospital, we could be sued for 
negligence, for not having a telephone. Well, then I would have 
to call 
on Mary Hufford and you coming in and saying, no, he's 
from a different cultural hearth and ethnic group, and he can't 
be expected to have this. It'd be a very interesting law suit. 
But that's why it's important to have these documented - for just 
that reason, that it's for the general health and welfare of the 
country to continue agriculture like this. I hope he's still 
around. There's no trucks around here. 
BR: 
...we pick by weight. They take these buckets out, they 
usually take two buckets, and when they get the two buckets full 
they bring'em up. I usually go out with the ( ) maybe three or 
four times a day, couple times 
in the morning, couple times 
in 
the afternoon. And these buckets usually hold around thirteen 
pounds - twelve or thirteen pounds. And then I just take the 
bucket and dump'em. I have trays 
in 
the truck, with cups in'em, 
and I dump'em. That way you see what everybody's picking. 
Sometimes we have problems, people like fill'em up with sand, 
leaves, sticks, anything like that. 
BT: There's two different ways of picking. One is 
to take the 
trays and cups and everything out 
in the field and picking 
in the 
buckets and then dumping it 
in. That's the way we pick at Retreat 
- I'll show you that when we get back. But that's what we do. 
GH: What kind of cups are these? 
BR: Pints. 
GH: So this is when people are picking for you. 
BR: Yeah. Alot of people - that's the way we used to do 
it, we'd 
pick right in 
the pint cups. 
GH: Now these Beregard trays, are these specifically manufactured 
for picking? 
BR: Mostly blueberries 
BT: Raspberries use pints too. 
BR: And I think strawberries, alot of strawberries are coming in 
pints now. Used to be quarts for strawberries. We used to years 
ago pick 
in quart boxes - I can remember that ( ). 
GH: So how close to a pound 
is that? 
BR: That's about fourteen and a half ounces. That's what they 
require us to have in'em. 
GH: Rounded over the top. 
BR: 
It'd be a rounded pint, yeah. You can get a pound 
in 
if you 
pack 'em. 
GH: So you deliver these to the co-op. 
BR: Then they're put 
in the tray like this, dump it over the top 
- well, he's gonna show you. They put a cellophane top, cap on'em, 
with true blue, and they're put in there 12 pints to a tray. And 
then we take'em down to the co-op 
in the evenings - we pack all 
day and then late 
in the afternoon we'll take'em down there and 
then they ship'em to New York, Boston, Philadelphia. 
GH: they're shipped this fresh out of there? How long does 
it 
take to get to the market then? 
BR: They're in the market the next morning. 
GH: You have big tractor-trailer trucks? 
BR: The tractor-trailers leave out of here probably around six to 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 215 
eight o'clock at night. And they'll be 
in the markets — they can 
go to Boston, no big problem. Now the western markets, they'll 
put'em in 
the refrigerator truck, and they'll be another day 
Like we send'em to Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland. 
GH: What temperature is that? 
BR: I think they try to keep'em at 40 degrees. 
BT: We've got a pretty good western market now until Michigan 
comes in. 
GH: So Michigan, they start up 
late? 
BR: See, their freight isn't as great, their trucking cost isn't 
as great, so they can take that market away from us. 
GH: Do they have a later developing... 
BR: Yeah, they don't usually give us any competition until about 
the 20th of July. Then they start in. 
GH: So you start here about the 25th of June or so? 
BR: Yeah, we're gonna start, we figure about the 20th of June, 
25th of June. 
GH: 
Is this year a little later than normal? 
BR: A little later. 
BT: We got hurt too, which took some of the early blues. 
GH: And then how long does the harvest continue? 
BR: We usually figure six weeks. We usually aim to try to get 
done by the 10th, 15th of August. By that time your help's played 
out, they want to take off for their vacation. You use a lot of 
the school kids, college, and of course they usually go back 
right after Labor Day. 
BT: 
It's hard to get people to work those last two weeks in 
August. 
GH: 
It's hot and muggy. 
BT: Well, they have things to do before school starts. 
BR: And most of'em are done. Now they got a new, a later variety 
coming out, and eliot variety. And that comes real 
late. That'll 
come 
in the latter part of August. But I haven't, I've only got 
one row. Did your dad get any? 
BT: No. And they say they're soured, aren't they? They don't even 
take'em. 
BR: Yeah. They're ( ) good. 
GH: One thing I'm curios about is with the pollination — is that 
with bees, do you have the beekeepers come out? 
BR: Yeah, 
it's the red bee. Usually we figure one hive per the 
acre 
GH: How many acres do you have right around here? 
BR: Approximately 50 acres. I have two farms, I have this farm 
and another farm over on Junction Road(?) 
BT: You can probably see some of the bees now, the cranberry 
people just put bees out. 
BR: Yeah, they're putting bees out. 
GH: The beekeepers, 
is that kind of a special business, 
is 
it 
local 
or do they go all 
over the east? 
BR: Well, I have both local — I have a beekeeper up here in 
Presidents(?) Lake which 
is about three miles from here. He had 
ten hives and he asked me 
if 
he could rent'em out to me. 
GH: 
Is that a regular size operation, ten hives? 
BR: No. Now this other fellow comes from Florida. I don't know

there. Oh, I think we paid 22, 
BT: 
Is that all? I thought 
BR: Oh no — it's around 23. 
GH: That's for the whole se 
in the fields? 
BR: We leave' em, oh approxi

BR: Yeah. You have to be ve 
GH: Do you have to pay the 
off the bees? 
BR: Well, we wouldn't think 
BT: And you know that, the 
they can and can't spray. 
BR: Even the federal govern

where your dad gets his. 
BT: Kenneth Square, right around the mushroom area. I guess 
have the apple trees out and around there or something, and 
come up from there to bring'em up. 
BR: Now this other fellow, the co—op 
from Massachusetts. But they take'em 
winter, 
in the early spring down there 
the oranges and citrus. Then they brin 
the blueberries in Carolina. 
GH: They have blueberries there too? 
BR: Yeah. And then they'll bring'em on here. And then

sprayers know that around here, what 
ment, they sent me a notice this year. 
vernment, which is 
at least five, six 
es, that they were going to spray for 
oing to use 7, which is very toxic to 
ce that they were going to do 
it, 
case there was any drift or anything 
BR: 
...and I didn't get the results, I didn't ( ) The dilox is 
much better, 
it's non—toxic to people, non—toxic to humans. 
In 
fact, they say, Phil Burcher was telling me, that down 
in 
the 
tropical countries they — in South America — they drink some of 
that, for worms. For humans. I didn't realize that. He says 
that's very — there's hardly any toxidity to 
it at all. But it 
certainly does the job on gypsy moth. But the thing, the main 
thing with gypsy moth, you want to get'em when they're small. 
When they get up an 
inch long or longer, they're harder to kill. 
BT: And they go for the bloom, too, one of the first things that 
they go for. 
GH: Gypsy moth? 
BT: Yeah. 
BR: They prefer an oak tree. 
If they could eat anything. 
GH: But they do come into your blueberries? 
BR: Oh yeah. See, cause we don't have many oak, around here. It's 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 217 
mostly maple and ( ), 
and it's not too much oak. 
GH: So how do you control 
it, 
you use this dilox? 
BR: Dilox. I'm not, I didn't have to use anything this year, 
didn't have to use anything. 
BT: We didn't have any trouble either. 
BR: No problem. Yeah, we just finished spraying again yesterday. 
GH: You're famous here for this new disease, sheeps 
BR: Sheep pen hill disease. 
GH: Do you have some out 
in 
the field? 
BR: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. 
GH: When did 
it start turning up? 
BR: Well, we first-noticed it about fifteen years ago. We didn't 
realize what it was, whether it was even a problem then. We just 
noticed a bush here and there, with 
it you know 
GH: 
Just, kills the bush outright? 
BR: No, 
no, 
it doesn't kill 
the bush. And then, within the last 
ten years it's really got to be serious. And I been keeping 
records for six years, and I'll show you the rows I been keeping 
records of. 
BR: There's the — the second bush on that row, has sheep pen hill 
disease. A little off color, no crop on 
it, hardly. No crop. 
(unintelligible) now this year they do have a few berries. That 
is what's cost you ten million(?) See how these laterals have 
died back? They, when they come out and bloom, they're just like 
a normal bush. The bloom comes out, and then just about four or 
five days after the bloom, they start to dry right up on the 
bush. And all 
you can see 
is brown. They just dry right up and 
fall off. And the bush gets a paler green. I think you can still 
see, this isn't quite as deep a green as that. Two weeks ago, you 
could look right across this field, and you could spot every 
sheep pen hill disease bush by the color. 
GH: Would they be scattered then? 
BR: Yeah, scattered. 
GH: 
Is this another one here? 
BR: No, that's a different variety. 
GH: What variety do you have here? 
BR: This 
is bluecrop. 
GH: And that big—leaved one there? 
BR: That there 
is a Berkeley. 
GH: Right, we were looking at some of those at his field. Does 
it 
attack all 
your different varieties? 
BR: Every variety has it, 
but the bluecrop variety is 
least 
susceptible, I should say. Weymouth, very susceptible, I can show 
you acres of Weymouth here that are completely wiped out. 
It's 
gonna be economically impossible to keep on with it. I just gotta 
push 
it out. That two acres there was 
in Weymouth. I pushed 
it 
out last fall. 
GH: 
It doesn't go away, 
it just kind of spreads? 
BR: We haven't come up with any answers to 
it. 
GH: So 
if 
it attacks one bush this year, next year it'll be 
worse? 
BR: The records I been keeping — it's so funny. I been keeping 
records now for six years on four rows. First year, I had 24 
Hunn--B4 Audiocassette logs 
page 218 
bushes out of 240 plants that had 
it. The next year it increased 
to 35. The next year it dropped back to 17. The bushes that had 
it didn't appear to have 
it. Now this year it 
isn't as bad on 
those four rows that I been checking for six years, as 
last year. 
It's really — worries you. Because they haven't found no answers 
for 
it yet. But I definitely think it's a root problem. 
BT: You think it's a virus? 
BR: Now that's the 
last theory they're working on, 
is a virus 
transmitted by a nematode. But they have dug up, 
like they dug up 
that bush and they dug up this bush, and they examined the root 
system, and the root system on this bush 
is not as healthy as the 
root system on that. 
BT: They were down yesterday, the state people. Paus has eight 
bushes and we have two at Retreat. And it's the fifteen years 
that they were talking about, that they thought it would start 
showing up, and 
it started in our bluecrop, and some crosses. 
GH: 
Is there a pattern in terms of 
its occurrence around the 
region? 
BR: 
It started in this area first. That's why it's called sheep 
pen hill disease. Because this 
is 
the first area they noticed it. 
And, as we say, this field — the original field that started 
it 
was over there, Mrs. Bush had 
it originally. Now I got it, 
now 
it's over that area. But now I have another field, about two 
miles over on this side — you can't find 
it over there. And I use 
the same cultural practice, I use the same machinery, and 
it just 
seems so strange you know. 
GH: Do they have quarantine arrangements in terms of keeping from 
spreading? 
BR: No. 
GH: So you could pick the fruit off this? 
BR: Oh, yeah. The fruit isn't infected. In fact, that fruit 
tastes alright. Now with the stump disease, which is a virus, the 
fruit is bitter. It doesn't develop and it's small 
This fruit'II 
taste alright. 
BT: Don't you think people are asking now where they're getting 
their cuttings? 
BR: Oh yeah. Now see I'm trying to propagate (unintelligible) 
BT: But it does scare you. 
BR: Yeah. I just want to walk over here and show you the Weymouth 
variety — how severe 
it can get 
BT: We saw Blache Gower's field yesterday. Terrible, we just 
couldn't believe it. 
I'll 
be very interested to see where it 
spreads ( ) 
BR: Mmhm. 
BT: But they're working on 
it. 
BR: Oh yeah, they're working on 
it. 
As I said, your generation 
won't see 
it, 
the next one will — see the cure. Which 
is not very 
encouraging. See there's a bush. 
GH: So do they either have it or they don't, or 
is 
it a matter of 
degrees? 
BR: 
It can be degrees, too. 
GH: What do they do for stump? 
BR: ( ) and spraying. They've determined that a leaf hopper 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 219 
carries that. On the diseased bush, and then flies from that bush 
to the next bush, or another bush, and feeds on that. And that 
transmits the virus. 
BT: What do you spray with, to take care of that? 
BR: Any of these sprays will take care of 
it now, but usually 
Mala( 
). 
Leaf hoppers are very easy to kill. 
GH: So 
if you can keep the leaf hoppers from spreading it, 
then 
i 
t 
' 
I 
I die out. 
BR: Mmhm. ( ) not too much of a problem, but twenty, thirty years 
ago 
it was a very, concerned everyone. 
GH: So when a disease like this crops up, who invests the 
resources in doing the research? Is 
it Rutgers, the state? 
BR: Rutgers — they're getting money from Rutgers, they're getting 
money from the Elizabeth White trust fund, and the co—op has 
kicked in some money for it. 
GH: And the research 
is being done out there at the center, down 
by Jenkins? 
BR: Oswego, yeah. Flock of jersey — rubel(?), completely wiped 
out with sheep pen hill disease. There's rubel bushes 
(unintelligible) 
GH: This is a particularly tall variety? 
BR: A tall, thin variety. But this 
is 
an old field, this field 
here 
is 
(unintelligible) 
GH: So which 
is which? 
BR: This is the row rubel, this is 
row jersey. 
GH: And this 
is jersey over here too? 
BR: That's jersey. 
BT: When did you start planting ( ). 
BR: Oh, I would say about 1960. Somewhere in there. 
BT: Cause I've really never seen the old ( ) 
BR: Yeah, I'll show you (unintelligible) 
GH: 
Is that for control? 
BR: That was for pollinization. They will cross pollinate. 
BT: Did you know Herbert Beebee? 
BR: Oh, yeah. 
GH: Does the cross pollinization increase the yields? 
BR: Sure. Better's their yield. Now some varieties they still 
recommend that you interplant, because they are not self— 
pollinating. 
GH: These new varieties that are planted in solid blocks, are 
they self—pollinators? 
BR: Well, that's what we bring 
in the bees for. Here's Weymouth. 
You don't see a berry on hardly any of'em. I'd just like to see 
if I can find a normal bush here. Look at this one, looks almost 
like a complete wipe—out. 
BT: Yeah 
it does. 
GH: What's the variety about three rows over? 
BR: That's bluecrop. 
BT: This is the same variety as those short ones we looked at, 
ate some off of. 
BR: Here's a bush that's normal(?) 
in here, one. 
BT: Close anyway. 
GH: Big fruit. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 220 
BR: 
I'd call this 99 percent. 
GH: What was this like 
last year? Was 
it normal 
last year? 
BR: No, no. And there's another, I got — well, that was a block 
of Weymouth, two acres, I ripped that out last year. There's 
another two acres I ripped out last year. I got two, four, and 
these, 
left, 
to rip out. 
GH: That's about the only solution at this point. 
BT: Did you spray anything? You gonna spray anything before you 
plant? 
BR: 
I'm not even gonna plant. I'm just so discouraged I won't 
plant. I'll just concentrate on the other farm, cause I don't 
have 
it over there. So, I got a hundred acres of ground over 
there, you know, so 
'til 
they come up with an answer, I'm gonna 
let the ground stay vacant. 
BT: Was that a reason why you got two different fields to begin 
with? 
BR: Well, that was my father's field. He just died here about two 
years ago. 
BT: Cause we've got two different fields, Retreat and Chatsworth, 
and there's never been a year where one hasn't produced 
something. When the frost hits one, the other one seems 
BR: Other one comes through. No, this 
is — I just had this field 
for two years. I used to take care of 
it for him, see. He was 86 
when he died, and I thought he got it(?) for five or six years 
before he died. 
GH: How long have you been working in the blueberry business? 
BR: Since I was 18 years old — 1947 I started. 
BT: Who got you started? 
BR: My father. My father was one of the original — he started in 
1926, I started 
in 
1947. 
GH: What was his name? 
BR: Milton Reeves. 
BT: Who were the original co—op people? 
BR: Well 
of course, the Whites, Miss Elizabeth White and the 
Covilles, Dr. Coville and then his son Stanley took. over. And 
then -there was, 
let's see, the Cuttes were 
in 
it and the Haines' 
were original, down at Hogwaller. They were original, some of the 
first ones. And Herb Beebee. 
BT: Bu cis, 
of course. 
BT: Yeah, Herb Beebee worked for Buds at the time, of course Buds 
was 
in 
it. 
And then there was what they called double trouble, 
that was Matt Crab and Tom Rivers, they were always — they 
originally started at White's Bog and Rait(?) Pond, was the first 
fields. And rait Pond was double trouble and Stanley Coville and 
then Huntington and Hutton. 
BT: Then uncle Herbert had fields in Retreat 
BR: Retreat and Buds and Wells 
BT: He worked for Buds. 
BT: Yeah. 
GH: So originally you had to clear off the forest. How did you do 
that? 
BR: Well these were originally cranberry bogs. Now this part 
where we're standing now was wooded, maple and pine. But that was 
- well, 
in fact, you can see the old dam, still there. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 221 
GH: Are the ditches still useful? 
BR: Those ditches are for drainage, Yeah. 
BT: See, what I've understood is that during that time when the 
blueberries got started, you got the cranberry people really 
working on the waters and the headwaters. Bogs that didn't have 
good water to do those early practices of flooding and whatever, 
went to blueberries. 
BR: See now these are what they call dry bogs - there's no source 
of water. There's no 
live stream. So, they'd make good blueberry 
fields. Now, 
if you wanted to go 
into cranberry business here, 
you would have to put in wells, and put in sprinkler systems and 
that, and you could raise cranberries on this ground. But you 
have no source of water, only unless you went to wells. 
GH: Do people do cranberry cultivation that way? 
BT: They were doing 
it with wells, but generally they have other 
sources of water 
BT: Yeah, you have a live stream. More economical. 
BT: Ten thousand dollars a well. 
BT: At least, and then you got to buy your pumps. 
GH: I notice the soil here is quite a bit darker than 
in some of 
the areas 
in your fields. 
BR: This 
is what we call 
low grade - never have to 
irrigate. You 
don't have any problem with 
it burning, or dry weather. In fact, 
we do much better in a dry season than we do a wet. Much better. 
GH: So where's the water table? 
BR: Water table's within about 18 inches of the top of the 
ground. Underneath this 
is what we call hard-pan, that's what 
keeps the water table up. And that hardpan is what they usually -
back 
in the Revolutionary War days - used to pour the bogiron. 
You can't get a ax through it hardly. 
GH: How far down is that? 
BR: About 18 
inches. And that holds the water up. 
GH: Even in a drought, there'll always be water? 
BT: And all these fields around here are 
low, and probably most 
of 
them were cranberry bogs. 
BR: 
In fact, cranberry culture started right down here, about a 
mile , around the Sheep Pen Hill area, that was when the first 
cranberry bog, started by the Buds. Back 
in the mid 1800s. 
GH: Sheep Pen Hill must be a rise of ground around here 
somewhere? 
BR: No hill. No you want to know how it got it's name? They say 
that during the Revolutionary War is when the British came 
in to 
New Jersey. The farmers over around Burlington and Columbus and 
that area, drove their sheep up here to hide'em from the British, 
so the British wouldn't take'em. That's the story that goes with 
it, 
now 
BT: This was a great hinterland at that time and you didn't 
really have the fields. Cranberries were what, 1860, 70 
in that 
area? 
BT: Yeah, so 
it was all wooded. Nothing but woods. 
BT: Except what was cut down for bogiron furnaces. 
BR: Or coal, things like that. 
BT: I didn't realize that these were dry bogs until I was talking 
to a few people around here - and apparently you can't compete 
in 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 222 
the cranberry business without water. Apparently they did at one 
time, you could make money with the dry bogs. 
(unintelligible) 
BT: And that even has s.omething to do with the fertilizing and 
culture, doesn't it? 
BR: Sure. Yeah, you get much better... ( ) used to be 25 barrels 
to the acre, now it's up to around ( ) 
BT: Phil was quoting some astronomical fee of ten thousand 
dollars an acre to get a new cranberry bog. 
If you had to get 
machinery and dig... 
BT: Now they take all the topsoil and push it all 
in a heap. Then 
they come 
in with these pans and they grade it, 
get it on a level 
grade so when they do flood the bogs it takes only maybe six to 
eight inches of water from one end to the other. Where years ago, 
you had to have six foot of water down at the base where your dam 
was, to get the upper end flooded. That much difference in your 
elevation, see. 
GH: So they must get surveyors out there and really lay 
it out 
f 
I 
at. 
BT: Some old families, 
like — see, Edgar Haines 
in Vincentown 
made his money off of surveying the cranberry bogs. 
GH: He used regular surveying equipment? 
BT: Mmhm. Cause they were gravity fed before the wells. 
BR: My grandfather, 
in fact, I got his surveying instruments, the 
old chains, where they would measure everything by chains, I got 
the chains. I got his tripod and the surveying scope and 
everything. 
GH: They say, what, cranberry bogs should be within a half an 
inch of 
level 
all 
around. 
BR: Yeah — that way you use a lot less water. See they still 
flood to harvest and they flood to, towards winter, to keep'em. 
GH: Do you have problems with flooding in your field, with the 
hardpan down there? 
BR: Yup, that's my biggest problem, getting rid of the water. If 
you come up here sometimes after we have three or four inch rain, 
why the rows are flooded. And you'll notice I kind of ridge my 
rows. Some people are more flat, but I have to ridge'em to keep 
the roots out of the water. 
BT: The general gossip in Vincentown after a hard rain 
is that 
they haven't even gotten into the fields at Sheep Pen Hill yet. 
GH: Will that actually kill 
the bushes? 
BR: 
If they're under water, especially in warm weather. The water 
temperature gets up to 70 degrees and gets stagnant in there, 
it 
will kiII'em. 
GH: But in the wintertime 
BR: 
It don't bother'em then. 
BR: Now that's a sample of sheep pen hill disease, you'll see 
right there, that's really got it. The rest of 
it — now, as I 
say, over in the other field, got a nice crop of Weymouth over 
there, got a nice crop of bluecrop. But you just get so 
discouraged when you got something like this and you don't know. 
I spent money pruning these, 
it's a costly operation, pruning, 
if 
you don't do 
it yourself.

it myself. 
GH: Do you prune all winter long? 
BR: I usually start in November, and try to get done by the first 
of Apri I 
. 
GH: How many people? 
BR: I usually hire t 
to do the whole fift 
done. But there's to

Federal government 
enabling legislation and money, 
if 
by having 
state would respond 
g a pinelands commission, and 
state bought 
for'em 
BT: Well, you don't have to. Let me get some information to you 
now. At work they say — I work for the park service in the winter 
— they're saying that, from what they forecasted, those rights 
don't go down. And 
if you sell those rights, you can't put a 
house on here. 
BR: That's right. 
BT: Well, they're showing areas where they've had these 
comprehensive management plans and land has started to escalate 
in value when people find out that all 
those negative things 
associated with the city won't be here. So you could put a house 
on here, 
let's say, and sell 
it 
BR: I could build one house, what, for 39 acres 
BT: No, 
if you have your wife and 
BR: Whole family, yeah 
BT: You can get a piney exemption for each one of them, and put 
three houses on here 
GH: Piney exemption? 
BT: Those bastards 
GH: 
Is that what they actually call 
it? 
BT: Yes, right 
in the comprehensive managment plan. A piney 
exemption. And you could do that for here — what's thirty 
thousand in this business? Ten thousand dollars a right. My 
father's hard work — we get two on his clearing that land and 
keeping New Jersey green? We're not gonna sell ours, cause 
there's only two. We'd be better off getting a piney exemption if 
that were the case 
BR: But I have so darn much ground, I just thought, cause I got 
this 150 acres here, I got a hundred acres there, I got three, 
four acres downtown 
in New Lisbon 
BT: Well, you'll get more than three then. 
BR: Oh, 
I'm not even talking about this other — now the other 
farm is 
in the forest area, that's zoned different. And I don't 
know what — I don't think you get as many credits, I think you 
only get one credit there per 39 acres. 
BT: But you don't know what to do. You don't know if 
it's gonna 
go up 
in value, 
if 
it's gonna go down. 
BR: I thought maybe 
if you took the thirty thousand — say 
if I 
got three rights, and I took the thirty thousand dollars and 
invested it — course, not many people would do it, but they say 
if 
you did — say 25 years from now would I be ahead of the game, 
or would those development rights be worth more 25 years from 
now? I don't know. 
BT: 
It's people like him and my dad that were hurt. Because they 
kept good agricultural practices and didn't speculate on land. 
If 
you had speculated on land 
in 
the early 70s, gotten the 
government low interest to buy the 
land, a couple, three hundred 
acres, your development credits would have made a lot of money 
for you. Like some of'em did 
in Chatsworth. Some of'em have 
gotten a hundred thousand dollars down there. 
GH: So the state purchased the blueberry fields? Why did they buy 
the blueberries? 
BT: To protect the watershed and to acquire more land. 
BR: Now they do 
lease some back. But not much. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 225 
BT: Not blueberries. 
BR: No. 
.Just the cranberry land. 
BT: See, blueberries'II only give you a ten year lease. And when 
it takes you five to fight years to get a good crop, 
it doesn't 
give you much time to make any money back. 
BR: And these cranberry properties, a lot of them are yearly 
leases. Now Tom Darlington, on White's Bog, he got a five year 
lease. 
BT: And good money too, he got for his. He sold his land back to 
the state, and then leased it. 
BR: He sold it for three billion dollars, now he 
leases 
it back 
for 
BT: for 1500 dollars a year. 
GH: Three billion? 
BT: Yeah. Now you just tell me that those damn Quakers, they are 
always in on the ground floor for that money, and always will be. 
BR: And he took this money that, he traded some ground to the 
state and he went over and set up a new operation — beautiful set 
of cranberry bogs, they're all 
new bogs, 
level, small bogs, and 
he took that and developed that. Now he's back and leasing the 
old property, and doing the same thing with the old property. 
BT: For 1500 a year and not having to pay taxes. 
BR: Cause before he had to pay taxes on all 
the buildings were 
there — he doesn't want the buildings, 
let them have the 
buildings 
GH: He figured this out all 
by himself? 
BR: Sure. Yeah, he can figure it out, anybody can 
BT: But those Quakers have good education, and they knew this 
early on. And White's Bogs, what the state's calling now very 
early agricultural villages, going to hell. Because there's no 
one maintaining the property. It's terrible. 
BR: And now they're trying to get a group together to preserve 
White's bog. Old village. 
BT: And then they got these crazy environmentalists who are 
having blueberry festivals in the middle of blueberry season, and 
they think people 
in the area don't care about this. We don't 
have the time, 
in the middle of blueberry season, to go to a 
festival for god's sakes. 
GH: 
Is that out there where Eugene Vivian, where his operation 
is? 
BT: Yeah, and that's a private environmental concern, and he gets 
a dollar a year rent for going out there 
BR: Has a beautiful house, doesn't he? 
BT: Beautiful house? I can't believe it. And then they offer us 
10,000 dollars for your life's work. It's just ridiculous. 
GH: Frustrating. 
BT: Well, 
it's just not. fair. It doesn't seem to me that they're 
cutting up the pie the right way. 
BR: I said, I can see preserving a section to have green acres, 
you know, and for recreational areas for future generations, but 
I think the land owners that had this ground should have been 
compensated for it. 
BT: Specially when there's money to buy Darlington's bogs 
and 
the hinterlands and whatever. What they're doing is using us, 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 226 
keeping this open and green, without compensation 
BR: No compensation whatsoever 
BT: 
and we can't even get deer fence from the state. 
BR: And then you take the little town of Chatsworth — they been 
hit hard because all 
that ground around them, they were 
collecting tax dollars off of 
it. Now they come in, they're 
in 
the core area — you can't do nothing with that ground, who wants 
the ground? So they just said well, 
let 
it go for back taxes, and 
they don't pay their taxes on 
it. 
So, only the people with homes 
there, they're the ones left paying the taxes and their tax rate 
is what? Tripled? 
BT: Mmhm. Plus the 
idea that the state has bought land 
in there 
and they don't pay taxes. I'd forgot — the school wasn't open. I 
wanted to take you to the school 
to show you how, what kind of 
disrepair the school's in. 
GH: And they're usually dependent on local property taxes? 
BT: To run the school. The school's just in a shambles. 
BR: And they had one of the nicest schools — it was almost like a 
private school 
in there. 
BT: One teacher to ten, twelve students. 
BR: 
It was just a wonderful set up. And of course that was one of 
the reasons people flocked to Woodland township, was 
it had the 
open spaces and then a lot of those people that flocked there, 
just in the last ten, fifteen years, they're the biggest 
instigators of keeping everybody else out. They got in, 
now they 
want to keep everybody else out. 
BT: The lovers of nature don't want to pay for that. 
BR: No. no.

in there and weigh each can individually, 
and bring it down 
in cans. So 
it even helps us on the other- end, 
with ( )ing time. 
GH: They come 
in directly? 
DD: Yeah, I was a hero, because this thing was an ongoing battle 
between, you know, not getting enough weight, getting too much 
weight, and it was difficult for the growers to always be 
consistent and 
it was — when I left the coop as a platform helper 
here, 
in 
1968, there was a lot of growling about it. When I got 
back on there still was the growling. So the growling's over with 
now — that computer there has no conscience, he doesn't care 
whether you are right, wrong or white, black. 
BT: As long as the power doesn't go out. 
DD: You got it. 
BT: We have a generator, don't we? 
DD: No, not a backup for that, no. And yes, you hit a very touchy 
situation. 
BT: Electrical storms happen. 
DD: Yeah, 
in fact Fairbanks is supposed to be coming 
in today to 
fix this load cell again. You know, we've got to certify the 
whole state. 
XX: What kind of grading categories do you have? 
DD: We go with the A, B, C and juice, and that's determined by 
how many soft berries in a pound and how many stems, how many 
discards you have to go and then grading goes from there. 
XX: How do you actually count that? You sample? 
DD: Sample. 
GH: Each train. Take a train ( 
) 
DD: We don't, our processor does. I don't need — when 
it goes 
into L, which 
is right next to Hammonton. They do 
it, 
but I grade 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 228 
it here. And you don't reallt need — I can tell 
an A grade berry 
from a B grade berry, and Brad can, and anybody else that's been 
into 
-the business. You can look at 
it 
XX: So there's not much arguing about the grading? 
DD: Oh, sure, there's always room for argument. You can get an 
idea 
if you ask most growers — some growers are very good about 
it. They'll come in and before they even come off the truck, 
they're gonna nod their head and say, hey Dan, do what you can. 
But there are other growers that, you know, try to run a B or a C 
and 
insist on an A. We do have a little — every once 
in a while 
we do have a little conflict here. 
GH: You grade the whole batch, or just tray by tray? 
DD: Day by day — daily. 
GH: So, Brad brings in these cool berries that are liable to be 
in better condition 
DD: He'll get an A grade. 
BT: We don't get any difference, though, 
in fresh pack, whether we 
bring ours 
in 
cool or warm... 
DD: As long as the quality is standard. Now if Brad brings 
in a 
good batch of berries, and grower B comes in behind him with 
lesser quality berries, he gets separated out and he gets what I 
can get for him. 
BT: But there's still a large variety of fresh fruit in the A 
grade. 
DD: Mmhm. 
(tape speeds up — too fast to decipher, then stops. Rest of side 
one blank) 
GH: So you've recorded like forty hours of tapes? 
BT: About forty hours, on blueberries and stuff. 
GH: 
...go with I2S. That's his insecticide shed out there? 
BT: Yeah, I think it's used for insects — leaf hopper and that 
sort of thing. But malathion I know is used for that. 
GH: So let's see, he had blue rays, which were seriously infected 
with this 
BT: And the Weymouth were. 
GH: And he had the blue crop that's so far — the blue crop hasn't 
been affected so badly. 
BT: Right, he said that was the least. 
GH: And that's one of the more productive new ones. What's the 
one he had way over in the field? 
BT: Bluetta. 
GH: And that was infected. 
BT: Was not. 
It was not that far. What you'd hate to think 
is 
GH: That was named after this guy Guetta? He was a scientist or 
something? 
BT: No, I don't think any more than like, uncle Herbert. 
GH: Oh, a blueberry grower from around here. 
BT: Right. 
GH: And then, the North Carolina situation — they're getting the 
cultivars from New Jersey, and they're growing down there. 
BT: Mmhm, and we have a coop extension in North Carolina and 
Michigan. 
GH: Oh, so 
it's part of your company? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 229 
BT: Yeah. 
GH: And local people down there are involved 
they don't move 
down from here and set up the 
BT: Right. Well, 
it's both. Even 
in 
the Coville field down there, 
there 
is a blueberry network, and 
GH: So Coville had some land there as well? 
BT: Right, well, Coville had some brothers — you know, I'm not, I 
didn't go to school with any of these people so I don't know the 
names. 
GH: This 
is the Cornell Mafia. 
BT: Right, the Cornell scientists. And his brother had some — I 
don't think Cabot did. I think Cabot was a real fancy fellow. I 
wouldn't doubt that Cabot is named after the Cabots of New 
England, cause they are of that caliber of family. And Maury's 
family is related to Jay Gould. So they have had those instances 
of very wealthy elite American family. 
GH: Have you been down to the North Carolina blueberry area? 
BT: No. 
GH: 
Is 
it 
in a particular spot? 
BT: Same kind of belt that we have here, out in the wooded area. 
You know, now as a researcher, I would think of going down to 
North Carolina. But as a blueberry grower, by the end of the 
season — I would like to go down and see. I know there's a lot of 
families down there that have the same names, but they could be 
the same coastal English families that went up and down, and 
they're all 
related to one another from what I can see. Now when 
you study ( ) at Penn, you can see that they're all these 
cultural hearths that did have migration patterns, and they're 
probably half cousins down there. And then we have a coop 
in 
Michigan, I think 
it 
is. 
GH: Even the Michigan fields are part of your operation then? 
BT: Right, but the accounting stays 
in one area. So Michigan will 
have accounting out there, and Pemberton will have accounting 
here, and North Carolina will have accounting down there, which 
means that they run their own little centers themselves. And I 
would suppose, have their own reserves. 
GH: So then all 
the profits are centrally reprocessed? 
BT: Right, 
in those local 
areas. 
GH: So the local 
leadership makes the decisions? 
BT: Right. Well, we'll ask Denny 
if each area down there has it's 
own board — I think they do. I think our reserve's up to a 
hundred thousand up here. And we pay interest on that, each 
grower does, and that's 
in there to keep the coop going. And 
Denny 
is paid by the farmers. And I don't even believe there's 
any profit sharing with Denny — I think it's our money and, 
theoretically, they work for us. Practically, when you have big 
growers like Bill Haines or whatever, Denny can have his 
favorites to know that he has to appeal to. And I think they hurt 
us, people like Bill Haines, who have so much money they don't 
know what to do with 
it. 
To some of the small growers like Chippy 
Pepper and Stanley Whirl who are just getting into 
it, 
young guys 
about 35 to 40, every dollar is very, very important to them. 
Where it's not to Bill Haines. And some say that Bill makes his 
expenses off of blueberries and then his cranberries are just the 
profit. His brother's a judge and he's into the fancy lawyers in 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 230 
Mt. Holly — I'm sure he has really sophisticated tax consultants 
that he makes more off of manipulation than he does off a good 
market. 
GH: That's a problem with business generally, often you can make 
bigger profits through manipulation. 
BT: And I think with the smaller grower, we make our profits off 
of growing.

it.

the other grower, and I like to have, not detailed information, 
but just the general

BT: Must. 
DD: Yeah. Generally what'll happen, they'll get a crew leader 
that has contacts, you know, that know where to get the people. 
And they go out, and they're responsible. 
BT: Steve Lee's bus parked two blocks from where I live 
in 
Philadelphia. I couldn't believe it, I was coming up one of the 
streets around 37th, 
DD: You could get a free ride back and forth. That would drive 
him wild. Just drop me off right here please. You should try 
that, just smile and say, where do I go? I don't want to pick 
them, I want to pick those over there. And I know your field, 
they're better over there. Get em all cranked up. 
GH: And then they work all day? 7, 8 hours, till? 
BT:

DD: 4 or 5 o'clock. And then it's back home, and back 
in the 
morning, approximately 8. You know, by 
the time they can get 
in 
there and get started. 
GH: Then the trucks come 
in here all, over night? 
DD: Yes. This 
is the distribution point, for the berries. 
GH: So you kind of coordinate how many trucks you need? 
DD: Yes. Try to. As 
long as I have growers with telephones in 
their packing houses, I can generally do a pretty good job. Some 
growers I can't get 
BT: We're folklore now that we 
DD: to have a telephone. My job depends a lot on the telephone. 
GH: Communication's important. So the coop doesn't own any trucks 
itself? 
DD: No, we have no trucks of our own. We broker those out. I 
don't need to get into the trucking business. I don't think any 
of our members would really have any interest in trucking. I can 
pick a phone up and say, I need one. Sometimes you pay the piper 
for that, because when they back 
in, sometimes they decide you 
really don't need that one. You have to adjust and you have to 
move. 
GH: How many flats do you get on a truck? 
DD: Air stacking, I can go with the newer trucks and air—ride 
trailers, I can go about 3200. Palatizing's around 21, 2200. And 
the 3200 is — I will 
go with air—ride that high. That's a full 
trailer, that's from front to back. You know, just about to the 
top. And then on the conventional trailers, 23 to 2700. 
GH: 
Is 
it hand loaded at this point? 
DD: Lot of my berries are, yes, at this point. 
GH: So you must have a crew working right here too. 
DD: Oh, yes. We employ about eight people here, and they handle 
the stacking. Some of my closer markets, 
like Philly, New York, 
I'll palatize, and my Boston markets and farther west, see my 
western shipments, will be air—stacked. 
GH: How far west do you go? 
DD: Minneapolis, right now. We have shipped some into California, 
Detroit, Florida, Georgia. And a couple of others I'm not gonna 
comment on yet. Hope that a couple of others will come 
in soon. 
GH: So the price has dropped to 20 cents a pound? 
DD: From 65 to 20 cents, something like that. That's not final, 
that's 
BT: He's hoping it's not final. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 232 
DD: Yeah, that can't be f,nal or I'll just go out and put a gun 
to my head now. 
BT: There's a lot of people 
in the coop that aren't geared for 
fresh-picked, and 
it's hard to pick the berries for 20 cents a 
pound and make any money, 
isn't it? 
DD: Yes, 
it 
is. Hand-picking you can almost eliminate right 
there. The processed market - I don't have all 
the facts and 
figures but - no, I don't think you can do 
it. 
BT: I know you can't. Last year it was break even point at 65 
cents, that we figured 
DD: That's on packaged. 
BT: No, per pound. What I'm saying, we decided it was still 
better when it was 65 cents, we put it 
in the fresh market. And 
we were getting, I think, 75 cents to 80 cents a pint. And 
if 
it 
went down below 75 to 70, 
it might be to our benefit to put em 
in 
processed. 
DD: Last year. This year there 
is no 
GH: How can the price drop so far? 
BT: Michigan. If the Russians wanted to test a bomb, I know a 
place it would be really nice to test it on. 
DD: He can say that, I can't. But I can think 
it. 
GH: So Michigan, how can they do 
it so cheaply? 
DD: They can't do 
it much cheaper than what we can, because they 
are predominantly mechanical pickers, and they're geared more for 
the processed end of this thing than we are. And they have just 
taken this direction to try to take all 
the processed, which 
is 
crazy. Because 
in a year like 
last year, where everybody was 
predicting a short crop, with the weather conditions, they were 
sitting right on a bombshell, had a tremendous crop last year. 
They over-exceeded their best years 
in the industry. And it blew 
right up 
in their face. We were getting very good prices here on 
the assumption that we were going to have less volume of the 
processed than we have had 
in a few years, and Michigan put us 
over to tilt. Soon as we found out, of course, we got out of the 
market. About two weeks later, everybody found out how many 
berries there were - the wild industry had a very good year, and 
Michigan had a very good year - and we were very fortunate 
GH: So there's a wild industry? 
DD: Oh yes, very much so, 
in the processed. Now they're committed 
to processed, there's not many other places they can go. The wild 
berries are much smaller. 
GH: Where do they get them? 
DD: Maine, Nova Scotia. 
GH: There isn't a wild berry industry here 
in New Jersey? 
DD: Not commercially. There are some wild berries here, but I 
don't know of anybody commercially harvesting them. 
GH: Too many ticks. 
BT: The Ozarks have a wild industry, don't they? 
GH: Used to have a wild industry here, apparently. 
DD: Oh yeah, we used to do some wild berries here. 
GH: 
In Jack's(?) Meadow and Brown's Meadow. 
BT: The train station in Chatsworth, there used to be - I know 
they used to 
Lake em up there to Chatsworth. 
DD: No that was the huckleberry. 
BT: No, 
it was the wild blueberry 
I'm not even sure that people 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 233 
know the difference between a huckleberry and a blueberry 
They're just blue. 
DD: Very few of the real huckleberries around. There was a wild 
industry here. Cultivated took over that. 
BT: Grandpop Thompson made this machine with a carpet on 
it, 
and 
two pulleys 
DD: That's how they used to clean the wild ones. 
BT: and you would crank 
it and this carpet would go around and 
the good berries would go up, 
or down, whatever, and the junk 
would go one way. 
DD: 
It's s.omething that we should probably look 
into today. 
Something we've just forgotten about, but that carpet worked 
great. It's amazing how well that worked. Because the bad ones 
would stay on the carpet, they'd go up and over and the good ones 
would bounce on the carpet without any bruising or anything and 
come down into the can. And you think of 
it, 
and you think oh, 
it 
just can't work — but it works, I've seen it. 
GH: How are they sorted now instead? With screens? 
BT: No. 
I'll 
show you the machinery at Retreat. 
DD: That would be — I can explain it to you but that would be the 
best. 
GH: They'll be sorting some berries now? 
BT: No, I think I'll 
be able to show you a machine and how it's 
done, and we'll see Paus 
in production, so you'll get an idea of 
how it goes. Hadn't agotting hurt, we'd probably be right in 
the 
middle of the first picking, right now. 
DD: Yes. 
BT: But things are a little slow by three or four days. 
DD: Yeah, you would see some berries here now, more than likely. 
GH: My visit's kind of short, but it's possible, 
if 
it could be 
arranged, to have a photographer. 
BT: That's what Mary said, and I told her that would be fine. He 
could come 
GH: Once the operation's really underway? 
DD: You won't have to wait too long. 
BT: No, 
it's within three or four days. 
DD: The pin is out of the hand grenade right now, waiting for the 
handle to fly. That will 
be next weekend, really. 
BT: 
It would be nice to get some pictures of the loading dock and 
everything, when everyone's 
in 
line with the berries, to get an 
idea of the volume that comes from here. 
GH: Yeah, maybe we ought to concentrate on trying to set 
something up for next week. 
BT: Maybe 
it would probably be better to give him two weeks — get 
in 
the middle of bluecrop season. 
GH: He could come anytime. He 
lives out here 
in Mt. Holly. Great. 
DD: That would be — yeah, for any kind of pictures or any kind of 
an 
idea of what goes on here, that would be the time to do 
it. 
Especially 
XX: I think the price was 42 cents a quart. 
GH: By that time get the price right back down to where 
it was. 
BT: Well, for that time period, that was high. 
DD: Now, when you come back, you'll get a more complete picture 
of that, cause all 
my lugs(?) will 
be out and we'll have the 
Nunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 234 
(uninte,ligible) 
This 
is 
the original platform. And then from there we 
blossomed(?) to this, and this 
is only half — you can see where 
the bricks start, and where they weren't stuccoed. And then that 
last section was done in 
1959, I believe. With a core(?) which 
I'll 
show you. 
GH: That's the old fumigator? 
DD: That is the fumigator which you took a picture of. 
GH: (unintelligible) 
DD: Nothing but storage, nothing but storage. 
GH: No more fumigation? 
DD: No more fumigation. 
BT: What's the volume here? In New Jersey? 
DD: 
in New Jersey? About 28 million pounds. 
BT: What's that turned into dollars and cents, do you have a 
figure for that? 
DD: No, not off the top 
GH: 
...cranberries. 
DD: The poundage is about the same. 
It's amazing, where the 
blueberries and the cranberries per pound is about the same. 
Cranberries'II do about 28 to 30 million and so will we 
Dollarwise, I don't know. 
BT: You could probably say around 60 cents a pound. 
GH: For both? 
DD: Yeah, for both, to give you an 
idea, so you can go 60 cents 
times your 28 million and 
it will give you a rough idea. 
BT: We're talking fifteen million dollars, fifteen, sixteen 
million dollars. I don't know about cranberries. 
DD: Cranberries, I can't answer you, I don't know. I heard — what 
was 
it? — 50 cents a hundred pounds? 
BT: And that's a barrel? 
DD: That's a barrel and — I really don't know. 
GH: Fifty dollars? 
BT: Fifty dollars a barrel. 
DD: Fifty dollars a barrel, yeah, fifty cents a pound. So that 
would almost put us about the same. Cause we're doing, we're 
starting a new research panel 
GH: This doesn't include the operations that are separate from 
the coop. 
BT: No, not Hammonton or the 
individual people. 
GH: About what percentage of the total production of south 
Jersey, say, 
is coop? 
DD: Do we have? A quarter. We run about a quarter of 
it. 
GH: And probably most of 
it cranberries. 
DD: No cranberries here. This isn't Ocean Spray. This is not 
blueberries and cranberries, 
it's exclusively blueberries here. 
BT: 
In fact you'll find the people on the board, as well as the 
growers, some have interests 
in Ocean Spray. 
DD: very much so. 
BT: Bill Haines, his son 
is president of 
it now I think 
GH: But there's been no move to consolidate? 
DD: No. 
BT: No. 
GH: 
...bales of peat moss back there? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 235 
DD: OK, that s for our propagating. Our growers, a lot of our 
growers propagate, and that's what they root the whips 
in. 
BT: So you see, we go over to Sheep Pen Hill 
and we get some 
cuttings there and we send em and sell em to growers we don't 
like, so that they too won't have anything to pick. 
DD: OK, this building was reconstructed - you can see the old 
type bricks, which might be of 
interest to you. When they built 
this, there was an old barracks that they tore down. Stanley 
Coville had em tear the barracks down, put it 
in a truck, bring 
it 
here, then they rebuilt it, 
restructured it. They're all 
the old, 
the same roof joists, the same bricks - must have been a real 
undertaking. 
BT: Stanley Coville's an Episcopalian, and he was instrumental 
in 
the building of the Episcopal church in Pemberton. He and Miss 
White and those people. 
DD: This where it stops, and this 
is the new ( ) that we put on, 
46 to 49 I think it took to finish that. But this 
is 
new, this 
isn't from the barracks. 
(noise) 
DD: This 
is our cooler. I can take 
it down to about 32, 33 -
generate about 35 mile an hour winds, take 1500 crates at about 
95 degrees and 
in about three hours bring em down to forty. So 
it's a big refrigerator 
GH: Feels just like New Jersey 
in the winter. 
BT: (unintelligible) 
DD: That's right. 
(unintelligible) 
DD: This back here 
is where we're doing our processing berries and 
weighing. I have a computer printout that I program the grower's 
number in, 
and when he sets his berries on the scale I can tear 
everything out - I know the known weight, I use plastic pallets 
and plastic lugs, and

This tape 
is 
an 
interview with Jack 
Cervetto of Warren 
Grove, to begin about 3:30 PM, June the 22nd. 
GH: Why 
is that? 
JC: Forest fires is what- see there's a place back there, now a 
forest fire hasn't been 
in there and see, those oaks are pretty 
good size. But this was all 
burned out 
in 1936. Clean killed all 
that - I cut all that dead wood off for firewood. 
(unintelligible) and that growed since 1936. 
GH: So all 
of that... 
JC: There's nothing there big enough to cut anything out of. 
GH: So that's about 48 years old? 
JC: Yeah. It all came back - you could cut it off now and 20 
years from now she'll be pretty good size. Now - see those pines 
in there? The three pines. See, that's my pine cone shop, years 
ago. My moss and pine cones, years ago - I used to pop my pine 
cones back there 
GH: 
In the cement shed? 
JC: I had bins with hot air going 
under'em, with a hot air boiler. 
Same as we used to have 
in 
the house you know, registers? Had 
these registers under the bins, and that would pop 
and of course I'd have an awful 
lot of seed. Some of that seed 
started up there. Now that's the same pine that won't grow down 
there, hardly. Only grows three or four feet high down there -
but here in 
better soil, 
it proves to me that the soil 
has 
something 
to do with that stuff growing . That sandy soil down 
there. Because here's the same pine and better soil 
GH: 
It's got several trunks coming 
up - is that kind of 
distinctive, the way 
it comes up with those three or four trunks? 
JC: Yeah, that's all 
crippled, never amount to anything , but that 
is 
one of your dwarf pine seed down there, because that's all 
the 
pine cones I used to get from those dwarf pine there. 
GH: 
Is the dwarf pine a kind of pitch pine? 
JC: They're the ones that produces the most seed and that has the 
most pine cones on 
to 
it. The other, pitch pine, they're so high 
that you couldn't reach'em, where these, you just walk around and 
pick'em. So the soil 
has something 
to do with that down there. 
GH: I guess it's a bit of a mystery still, just exactly what 
causes that. Something 
to do with fire, and the soil. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 237 
JC: See now, Warren Grove 
is 
al 
oak bottom. You know, there's 
hardly no pine 
in 
here at all. Look around there, we'll 
look at 
that grove of pine where I used to have a sawmill 
in 
the forties. 
There's several oaks 
in 
there. Here's where I cut an awful 
lot of 
boat lumber before the plywood come out. The late thirties and 
forties. 
GH: From what kind of trees? 
JC: 
In those days, every boat was made out of cedar. Turn right 
just this side of that big oak there — right in 
here. Here's some 
of my work, here. 
GH: So this is where you do your cutting ? 
JC: That used to be my garage(?) there, stand there. And I cut an 
awful 
lot of cedar for boats. 
GH: Now you stack 
it up here and... 
JC: Now those people come and get that. Work down along the bay 
shore. 
GH: What will they be using 
these for? 
JC: Well, probably — well, they use'em for bulkhead, they use'em 
for many purposes. Dead men, the crooked ones they use for dead 
men. I don't know if 
you know what a dead man is? 
GH: No. 
JC: Well, when you build a bulkhead, down at the water edge, they 
go to work and they run a rod through that post that holds the 
bulkhead. Then they'll bury one of those thing s back there maybe 
thirty feet from the bulkhead, then they tie a rod from that — 
ber_ause that's gotta be buried — and that keeps that bulkhead 
straight. 
If 
they didn't put a dead man back there and tie 
it to 
it, 
that bulkhead wouldn't stay in 
position. 
GH: Which side — do they put it on the bay side? 
JC: No, on the dry side, because there'll be three or four feet 
of dirt onto it — they bury 
it. And naturally that won't move 
anymore, once that's packed. In other words, a anchor to the 
bulkhead. And the post has these dead men or anchors behind it, 
to hold 
it. 
GH: How old are these cedars? 
JC: 
Those cedar there is about a hundred — there's hardly 
anything 
you can cut less than a hundred years old. 
GH: So these are about... 
JC: This 
is old cedar. You can tell 
the difference. These gadgets 
— they got all 
new kinds of gadgets in 
the stores now. 
In 
brassy(?) cedar — that is, cedar that's just coming 
up green — and 
you might get it that size — but the way you tell 
old cedar is 
the heart, this red part. See this 
is deteriorating , this white 
part. That'll crumble right up and rot, but this'll never rot. 
In 
water or 
in 
the ground. Never, that would never rot. That's the 
heart. See and that's how you can tell 
old cedar, 
it has more 
heart than sap. This 
is 
the sap part. 
GH: So these are how many years old? 
JC: Hundred years, something 
like that. 
GH: Ten foot lengths? 
JC: Yeah. and 8 feet. 
GH: What kind of oak do you have around here? 
JC: That's turkey oak right there. That's the white oak over 
there, another white oak over there. There's a black oak 
in 
here. 
GH: And this one right here? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 238 
JC: That's a white oak. 
GH: So the turkey oak, the oaks... 
.JC: 
(unintelligible) 
GH: So you tell'em by the bark? 
JC: Yeah, by the bark. 
GH: The white oak has got this 
JC: Yeah, got the white bark. It's smooth — see how rough that 
is, 
that turkey oak? That isn't the right name for it, 
that's 
what we call 
it. 
GH: Good as any. So the black oak here 
is the real dark...? 
JC: Yeah, that's the black oak. Hard bark. 
GH: And then turkey oak has got this... 
JC: 
(unintelligible) I was looking 
for a pin oak ( )pin oak. 
GH: You use the different kinds of oaks for different thing s? 
JC: Around here, oak 
is mostly for firewood. Now that white oak, 
there's a demand for it 
if you get any size — they want at 
least 
12, 
14 inches 
in 
diameter, which 
is — it's not around here 
GH: So all 
this stuff has grown up — when did 
JC: This area hasn't been burnt for — I don't remember this area 
being 
burnt. 
If 
it killed the trees, I don't remember it 
in 
my 
time. That's where I attended school, there. 
GH: What about these other bushes, these huckleberries or 
blueberries or whatever you have growing 
in 
here? 
JC: These are upland blacks. Black huckleberries. You know what 
that is? 
GH: Some kind of grape. 
JC: Yeah, that's a baby grape. 
GH: Are there different kinds of grapes? 
JC: The little bitsy ones, they're the wild grape. 
GH: Do they call'em chicken grapes, or fox grape? 
JC: Baby grape. Some people call'em fox grapes, yeah. What did I 
caII'em? 
GH: Baby grapes. 
JC: Baby grapes, yeah. Small. 
GH: So this is 
the upland black huckleberry? 
JC: Yeah. they're the black ones. There's none on there. 
GH: What about this bush over here? 
JC: That's a huckleberry bush also. I don't know what color 
they'll 
be — they're black, there's a few of'em there, black or 
blue. But they don't amount to anything 
It's too shady in 
here 
for i 
t. 
GH: So that's the upland blue or black huckleberry? 
JC: Yeah. I don't know whether it'll be blue or black 
like those 
bushes over there. This has been a sawmill area for three hundred 
years. Right after the ( ) out of the swamp. 
GH: Who carried 
it on before you did? 
JC: Fellow by the name of Rube Corlies. They're blues — these 
here are blues. I know cause I been eating 'em for years. 
GH: So this is 
the blue huckleberry here? 
JC: Yeah, they're the blue ones. There's three different types, 
and three different sizes, of blue huckleberries. Now the swamp 
b►ues, that grows 
in 
the swamp — if you want to take a ride up on 
the dam, I can show you some of them — now they're the largest 
and the best ones for pie. I have cultivated berries at home but 
I'll 
go 
in 
the swamp and get blues 
if my wife wants to make a 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 239 
pie. To make a pie, I go get the swamp ones, the wild ones. 
GH: Why's that? 
JC: Oh, they taste a lot better. Oh, yeah. They taste a lot 
better. 
GH: So this is 
the upland blue huckleberry? 
JC: Yeah. The upland blues. 
GH: And that's the upland black huckleberry? 
JC: Well, there's black, there's blue, and there's also blue ones 
but the blue ones has got a smaller leaf — I don't see any here. 
They usually grow up 
in 
the dwarf pine area. That little 
huckleberry bush you see 
in 
the dwarf — that's the lowland blue. 
The upland blues. 
GH: And they're just little, 
low growing ... 
JC: Yeah, they only grow about that high. But they're loaded with 
huckleberries some years. I don't know how they are this year. 
They used to gather'em years ago, scoop'em. 
GH: So you said there's different sizes — there's the swamp 
blue... 
JC: Well, 
in 
the swamp there's the large black, there's the 
medium black, and the same goes for the blues. Different sizes. 
And the smaller they are, the more berries on the vine. 
GH: Do they taste any better? 
JC: But the taste 
is not there, no. Course when we used to gather 
em for the market, for the piehouses, why, they'd take anything . 
Anything 
at all, just so 
it was blueberries. 
GH: That tree over there 
is a maple? 
JC: 
Yup, that's swamp maple. 
GH: Do they use the wood from that for anything ? 
JC: There's no maple good enough for wood, no, not for lumber 
down there. There's none of that big enough. 
GH: For firewood? 
JC: 
It's good firewood 
It's hotter than oak, the fire. It's 
hotter than oak. 
GH: Does is burn fast, or slow? 
JC: 
It burns — all 
depends. If 
it's green, 
it'll 
take just as 
long as oak to burn up. But if 
it's dry, 
it'll burn a little 
faster, but 
it, 
gives you more heat. And especially in 
a 
fireplace, 
it gives you a better glow, a better color. Something 
in 
it gives you a nicer looking 
flame. 
GH: 
Is that a birch tree over there? 
JC: Birch right here. 
GH: What kind of birch do you have around here? 
JC: 
Just birch. When we cut that, we sold all 
the birch off 
around there, then ( ) years ago. There was a big market for it 
about twenty, thirty years ago. 
GH: Foe decorative logs? 
JC: Decorative logs — yeah, for everything . Table pieces. Yeah, 
I've cut loads of this. 
GH: So now it's hard to find? 
JC: Now it's all coming 
back, but it's small. They're still 
gathering , they're still 
looking 
around for it. There's a cluster 
of 
it there. 
GH: Yeah, I understand there's still a market for it. 
JC: Yeah, there's a big market. 
GH: That real 
big oak — what kind is that? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 240 
JC: That's a turkey oak. That's oak there, and that's alder, and 
that's what they gather. Now when I run that engine there 
I 
don't know if 
you're interested in 
engines —that's a .straight A 
Studebaker. '36. And that'd purr like a kitten when I was running 
the mill — run a belt from the driveshaft to the main pulley and 
that would run everything 
here. I had four or five saws there 
And I got, a well, dug right alongside the motor, and then with a 
hose 
in 
to the motor and the water would go 
in 
and come out the 
other side and keep the motor cool. 
GH: Water cooled? Just like a radiator. Well, maybe we could run 
down to the swamp and check the berries there. 
JC: 
Yeah, we'll go down to the swamp 
GH: What's this here? 
JC: I don't know what that is. 
Is that huckleberry? It's not oak 
of any kind. 
GH: Looks more like this tree here. 
JC: Well, we have 
GH: 
Is that the gum? 
JC: That looks like a gum. (unintelligible) That might be 
GH: 
Is there any special use for the gum? 
JC: No — it's worthless. You can cut that tree down, 
in 
six 
months it's all pulverized. The quickest wood we have around here 
to rot. 
GH: You use these acorns for anything ? 
JC: Acorns? Nursery there ask me one time if I would gather them 
some pin oak and white oak acorns. And I just go around, I 
couldn't do anything 
with'em, they were just scattered around so 
much I couldn't (unintelligible). 
GH: They wanted to cultivate'em? 
JC: They wanted bushels of'em, yeah. 
GH: The Indians who lived here before, did they use acorns at 
all? 
JC: That I don't know. You want to see that wire grass? 
GH: Now that's your triple white oak? 
JC: That's Mark's(?), that's my corner. That's got three notches 
on to 
it. 
My 
line runs right up the road and cuts across right 
the re . 
GH: What's all 
this growing 
in 
the marsh? 
JC: Water lilies. 
GH: That plant with the white top on 
it — just a low grass—like 
thing 
with a white top on 
it. 
JC: Oh. They're buttons. That's what we call'em, buttons. They 
got a hard, 
little white button. 
GH: 
Is that used for anything ? 
JC: No. No, there was some fellow from Morristown, and they 
gathered something 
in 
there, some kind of a flower or something, I 
don't know what it was. Course we have, what have we got, 238 
blooms, flowers blooming, right now, this month. Too many for me 
to ... This 
is where the main stream goes through. 
GH: So this is 
the Oswego. 
JC: Oswego. 
GH: The main branch. 
JC: Yeah. This part was settled here in 
1790 — not the part 
in 
there now. But that was 1790. Here's another tick — my gosh. 
GH: They're sure out 
in 
the woods. 
I've been picking 'em off all 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 241 
week. So you've got the white spotted tick? Is there something 
called a deer lice? 
JC: The tiny ones? Those little tiny ones? Yeah — I don't know 
what you call'em. They're so small that you have an awful time 
see,ing'em. And they dig 
in . 
GH: They're not just the baby ones? 
JC: I don't know if 
they're the baby ones or a different breed, I 
don't know. 
...also close to where man has disturbed. 
GH: Does it have any flowers on 
it? 
JC: You won't find it — no, I don't 
GH: What's this oak? 
JC: That's the — what the heck 
is 
it called? That's the oak. I was 
telling you about that grows 
in 
the — see, this 
is the shore hills 
here. There're the bachelor plains separated from the west plains 
and the south plains — this 
is a area 
in 
here where they call 
the 
short plain, or the little plain. Stuff 
in 
here grows a little 
shorter than 
it does down there. And that's the oak. 
GH: Are there any kind of animals that feed on this, 
is 
it 
blackjack or bear oak? 
JC: Could be blackjack oak. 
It's got — some of 
it gets round 
balls on to 
it, 
round balls about the size of a plum. And there's 
a little black powder in side. 
GH: What causes that? 
JC: I don't know if 
that's seed or what it 
is, I don't know. 
GH: Here's a radar installation, a communications installation. 
GH: People came out here and they wanted you to find some of this 
wiregrass for them? 
JC: They wanted me to show'em the wiregrass 
GH: Does it have a flower, later on? 
JC: No. I never seen a flower out there. Nope. 
GH: So what'd they do with it, once you showed it to them? 
JC: Oh, they took pictures of 
it and looked at it with magnifying 
glasses. I don't know. They didn't even take any with'em. 
GH: So this is the pine barren. 
JC: 
(unintelligible) sand. No nourishment, but it seems to thrive 
good. 
GH: What kind of huckleberries grow out in 
this area? 
JC: You'll find them big black ones. That's all 
you'll find 
in 
this area. 
GH: Are they the ones with the big seeds? 
JC. No. 
GH: How about this— this plant seems a little lower. 
JC: This 
is that blue one I was telling you about. That's the blue 
ones. 
GH: 
Is that a good one to eat? 
JC: Oh, they're all 
good. They're all 
good to eat. They all 
got a 
different taste, too. This has an entirely different taste than 
this one. 
GH: So that's the upland blue. 
JC: Yup, and that's the upland black. 
GH: And there's a little taller one.. 
JC: That's the upland blue. You can tell 
by the leaves, see, they 
got different color leaves. Why there's no berries on'em, I don't 
understand that. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 242 
GH: Here s a little berry coming 
out on this one, but it's still 
green. 
JC: Yeah, there we are. 
GH: That's your upland blue, too? 
JC: Yeah. It's unusual to see'em that size. Maybe it's out here 
in 
the open, better sun. 
GH: So there's just that one kind of upland blue — there 
aren't... 
JC: ( )kinds, yeah. Now the black ones, there's small ones and 
the 
large ones of black ones, too. Two different families or two 
different groups. 
GH: Do they have different tastes? 
JC: Well they all 
have different tastes (unintelligible) 
JC: 
...we have grouse, quail. 
GH: Mmhm. They're a ( ) kind of ( ) 
JC: You get a good crop of acorns — there's different size 
acorns, you know, deer eat all 
sizes. But quail eats the small 
ones. Now the... 
GH: That's a slightly different looking 
oak there. 
JC: Oh that's scrub oak. 
GH: That's the scrub oak. 
JC: That's called scrub oak. 
GH: What kind of acorn does 
it have? 
JC: They produce a lot of acorns — in 
spots, not everywhere. 
That's the acorn that's half the size of the tree acorn, and 
smaller animals feed on that. Specially grouse. Grouse and quail 
GH: But you say 
it's hard to find — they only have acorns 
in 
patches? 
JC: Patches. Well that's what we do — that's what we do about a 
month before, just before deer season, a month or two before deer 
season, that's what we used to do, 
go around and see where the 
acorn patches are, we know that's where the deer were. 
GH: 
I've read that without those acorns the deer wouldn't last 
the winter. 
JC: Well they have certain grasses that they eat along the 
savannah bottom. There's a certain grass there they eat. They eat 
huckleberry brush. You can turn around here and go back, by 
Chatsworth. 
GH: The savannah bottom we went to — could we get to a savannah 
bottom again and see 
if we can find some of that savannah grass? 
Or 
is 
it hard to find. You say there're some plants there that 
deer like to eat — the savannah grass? 
JC: Yeah, they — well, we can go out and I can show you a savannah 
bottom where it's grassy patches 
in 
to 
it. Someplace round here 
GH: I saw a plant here with a flower on 
it. 
So you used to 
collect a lot of these plants? 
JC: Oh yeah. 
GH: What were some of the thing s you collected besides pine 
cones? Did you collect the laurel? 
JC: Collected? Oh, two—foot huckleberry brush — that's the size 
the re . 
GH: Was that the black? 
JC: Made no difference, just so 
it was two foot long. 
GH: That's all 
they cared about? 
JC: That's all. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 243 
GH: So you had to out 
it, 
just right. 
JC: Cut it, packed it up 
in 
bundles and — boy when they got 
through coloring 
that stuff, did 
it 
look pretty. 
GH: Where'd you take that, to Allen? 
JC: Fellow up 
in 
Tappan, New York used to handle a lot of what I 
used to get. 
GH: What's that stuff growing 
all 
over the field out there? 
GH: 
Is this that uversi? 
JC: No, 
no, 
it's not uversi. 
GH: Now it was this stuff out here I was wondering 
about. 
JC: Oh, that's sweet fern. That's the stuff you want to stay away 
from when the sand ticks are out 
That's what you get laden with 
sand ticks. 
GH: What's a sand tick? 
JC: Little reddish spot, you can hardly see with the naked eye, 
get right 
in 
your pores and you itch for a week 
if you don't take 
care of 
it. 
GH: Are they out this time of year? 
JC: Yeah — not yet, they will 
be though, next month. All the way 
till fall. 
GH: Well 
I'm glad you warned me about that. 
JC: Now there's your Papoose (swamp) 
GH: Got a pretty good crop. 
JC: Yeah, got a good crop. 
GH: 
Is that the first one to come out? Do they come out at 
different times? 
JC: They come out about the same time as the swamp ( ) 
GH: I 
' 
I 
I take a little bit of this 
JC: This 
is the ( )blue. Now this 
is a little smaller berries 
than that. 
GH: That's upland blue, too? 
JC: Yeah. Now the black one's got a different leaf. 
GH: 
Is this what they call a sugar huck? 
JC: Yeah, you can call 
it a sugar huck. They're the sweetest 
berry there is. That's right, you're right. You've been around 
before. 
GH: Well, I've just heard the term — I didn't know what it 
looked 
like. 
JC: This stuff grows just like cranberry — we call 
it wild 
cranberry, but they're not even in 
the cranberry family. They 
grow like cranberry, but I don't know what the name of 
it 
is. 
GH: Doesn't get a berry or anything ? 
JC: No. 
GH: Across the road here there's a plant. Is that anything ? 
JC: Yeah, that's a special flower. It's not a — honeysuckle, 
it's 
a miniature honeysuckle, sort of, but 
it has a name of 
its own. 
GH: And that's your s.crub oak. 
JC: Yeah, that's scrub oak, and then the other oak behind. They 
produce a awful 
lot of acorns (unintelligible) 
GH: Now this, 
in 
there you can see the cones of different ages? 
JC: 
Yes, the pine cones. Yeah, the green ones are this year's. 
GH: And there's some brown ones and some grey ones? 
JC: Yeah, there's three or four years' cones on there. The grey 
ones are the old. Now when 
GH: When you pick cones to sell, what kind do you have? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 244 
JC: You have to get the green ones. You have to, yeah. Well, you 
get the brown ones also, but that was a different market. That's 
the one they paint, color. Most of them, when they first started, 
they wanted the green ones, course they turn brown, and when they 
opened them up they didn't have to do anything , they had an oak 
finish to'em. Pretty. 
GH: 
I've heard they look just like roses. 
JC: That's right. The shape of'em, they're just like roses. 
GH: When you pick cones, would you pick'em now or would you wait? 
JC: No, you wait till frost. We used to start in 
about the middle 
of September. 
GH: 
Is that because the cone isn't... 
JC: The cone 
is mature then and it's kinda drying up and it snaps 
off the vine easier. You go to pull that off, that's so sticky 
with pitch now you have to get half the branch with it. 
GH: I guess the pitch, sap, goes back down. 
JC: That's right. 
JC: ( )start picking, my god, do an awful 
lot of damage to the 
tree, 
letting that sap right out of 
it. Then for about five years 
you won't get any more pine cones out of that tree. You got the 
best nourishment out of 
it. 
GH: So picking 
the cones 
in 
the winter preserves the trees? 
JC: 
It don't hurt anything 
cause they snap right off. 
GH: Kind of dormant, I guess, on the branches. 
JC: 
...they blast it off. 
GH: There's still some 
in 
some places I guess. 
JC: Yeah, up by Poke's Bottom up there, 
loaded in 
( >. 
I see some 
of them's drying up a little. 
GH: 
Is that the best place for laurel — oak bottom? 
JC: Yeah. Well, that grows everywhere, that grows out on the 
plains, but not as plentiful. The prettiest laurel 
is down there 
in 
the plains, down 
in 
jack pine area. 
GH: Why's that? 
JC: I don't know. The laurel grows better there than anywhere 
else. 
GH: There used to be a market for laurel, i understand. 
JC: Oh yeah, they still 
do that. 
GH: Do you collect the foliage or the flowers? 
JC: Different people — get the greens and then they get the 
flowers. But the flower period 
is short, and they get it when 
it's 
in 
bud, by the time they get to use it 
it opens up. 
(end of side one) 
GH: 
...that too? Is 
it 
like honeysuckle at all? 
JC: No. There's some blooming there. And magnolia, this used to be 
a great place for magnolia here too. 
GH: Yeah, I thought I saw some magnolia. 
JC: Then the county come and cut it all 
down along the road, you 
know. Use to come through her 
in 
the evening 
GH: This 
is your triple white oak here? 
JC: This one right here. It's an old one. See those three marks 
right there — boy, they're old 
JC: There's your pine right here. 
GH: There are two needles, three needles? 
JC: Yeah, you have the two leaf pine and three leaf pine, that's 
right. 
Nunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 245 
GH: They're both upland pines. 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: 
Is the pitch pine - are they both pitch pines? 
JC: That's all 
upland pine, the pitch pine, yeah. 
GH: So what was going 
on here - that's the sand operation. 
JC: The sand mining 
plant. Not too much more to go. 
GH: They still working 
in 
there? 
JC: Yeah, they're still working . 
GH: Where are we headed right now - towards your... 
JC: Well, you'll see a road turn off to the 
left. They got it 
blocked off, we have to park here on the road and walk in . 
GH: So it's a plant that comes up where people have disturbed the 
soil. 
JC: You can't see jump-up - that's what t ) There's a patch of 
cedar, then a great big grassy spot, and a patch of cedar, grassy 
spot ... 
GH: So the cedar bottom alternates with the grassy bottom? 
JC: 
(unintelligible) 
GH: 
Is that cause of the clay 
in 
the soil? Hey there's a frog. A 
frog 
in 
the pond there. 
JC: Yeah, I think so. 
GH: Are there a lot of different kinds of frogs around, or just 
frogs? 
JC: I didn't see it. Was 
it a green one? 
GH: 
It's on the far side, 
it's got stripes on him, kinda 
blackish. 
JC: Oh yeah, that's - we call'em green juggers. They're green 
when they're out in 
the sun. That's the kind we used to get and 
strip'em to catch catfish with. One frog would give us enough 
bait to fish all night. When I was a young fellow. 
GH: One frog would be enough bait to fish all 
night? 
JC: Yeah. Nice lean meat, 
looks like veal. Real nice. 
GH: You ever eat it yourself? 
JC: No. I believe people eat'em though. 
GH: So what kind of noise do they make? 
JC: They're the ones that makes the noise the first - first thing 
in 
the spring . I couldn't even imitate, I couldn't even tell you. 
But there's hundreds of'em hollering at the same time. You look 
forward to hearing 
the 
GH: Here's another bush that I've seen around. 
JC: That's honeysuckle - no, 
that, you know what that is? 
Killcalf. That'll kill 
you. My wife had an uncle died from that 
one. When he was a boy, he was riding on another boy's back, same 
as a horse you know. And then you know how a horse does, reaches 
over and bites some grass brush? He ate some of that and 
it 
killed him. Killcalf - that'll kill cows too. 
GH: Guess you gotta know what's out in 
the woods. Here's the 
laurel. 
JC: Yeah, that's a human enemy right there. Don't have too many 
of them, but that killcalf is the worst that we have. 
GH: 
Is 
it related to the laurel at all? 
JC: No, I don't think - well, I couldn't tell you that. There's a 
little of 
it there. 
It 
looks like a huckleberry bloom. That's 
what fools you. 
JC: 
...all kinds of hard shell turtles, getting green 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 246 
GH: Yeah, yesterday I was down 
in 
the Coville area and we saw 
about four different kinds — snapper, box turtle, red bellied 
there's the deer track, huh? 
JC: Oh yeah, all kinds of deer tracks I've seen 
in 
here. One just 
crossed there. Before we get to the triple oak, that wet bottom 
that we seen? That's where the snappers are. Been thousands of 
snappers caught. My father—in—law used to have traps in 
there, 
fykes, catch'em in 
fykes, but there was a ready market for'em, 
and now... 
GH: Nowadays you don't. 
JC: No, the new generation, the younger generation, they don't 
know anything . 
GH: Have you ever done any snappering 
yourself? 
JC: No, I pick'em up when I run across'em, but I never went after 
em for a living. 
GH: Well they say the meats like all kinds 
JC: Oh the meat's good — oh, I ate'em, they're good. You take 
snapper stew, 
it's good 
GH: They say it's got different kinds of meat that taste 
different, from every part of the turtle. 
JC: Yeah. Yeah. Well there's a golden color snapper stew — stewed 
snapper. Fellow from Philadelphia used to cater these big 
gatherings, where thousands of people were eating at the same time. 
My god, that stuff was good. Well, I been in 
a consistory(?) 
there 
in 
Collings...if I could get a second dish of stewed 
snapper, I'd do away with the meal. Couldn't get that second 
dish. 
GH: I guess they get a lot of meat off of one of those big 
snappers, too. 
JC: Do you know that man, as far as I know, they say, he had that 
mixture, that recipe, never showed 
it to no one, never gave 
it to 
no one, and he died and no one has 
it. Most of your snapper soup 
that you eat 
is black, you know. Always was. But he had a golden 
color to that thing , boy that was really good. 
GH: Does the color come from the meat itself? 
JC: No, no, I imagine — I don't know how he added the color to 
it, 
but boy it was good. Put a little sherry wine 
in 
with 
it you 
know, right on the table. Nice buck right there. 
GH: You tell 
it's a buck by the size? 
JC: Split toes — the toes are split ( 
)does. 
JC: 
...split right out. 
GH: And what's this running 
onto the road here? 
JC: Might be a ground mole. You ever see'em? Have trouble with'em 
in 
the garden. They'll go right under your plants and lift'em 
right up, 
and your plants are dying 
off and you wonder why. 
GH: 
Is this killcalf again? 
JC: Oh yeah, we have plenty of 
it. Now there's a big buck. 
GH: You can sure see the difference. This guy that had the golden 
snapper stew — where did he cook? 
JC: Philadelphia 
GH: What's this one here, the pink flower? Sheep laurel? 
JC: I believe it 
is, 
sheep laurel. Yeah, I think so. 
GH: That's different from your regular laurel. 
JC: From the white one, yeah. 
GH: 
Is that good for anything ? Did you collect that, too? 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 247 
JC: They might have a different name for it, I don't know. 
GH: I just saw a toad go off 
in 
there. 
JC: Now we're getting in 
savannah bottom. Now all 
through here, 
you'll find patches all 
through here. Savannah bottom. 
GH: So 
is this the savannah grass coming up here? 
JC: Yup, that's the savannah grass. 
JC: I don't know what they call'em. Yeah, here's the — in 
clusters, they grow in 
clusters. 
GH: Strange, 
it's all sticky all 
over the stalk 
JC: There's a pretty one right there. Grows three, four, five in 
a cluster. 
GH: That's a plant from the grassy bottom? 
JC: Well, you find it mostly in 
grassy bottom, see — you see it 
all 
over. 
GH: 
Is this grassy bottom the same as the sedge bottom? 
JC: No, sedge bottom is 
in 
the bay. Sedge bottom is salt water. 
GH: 
Isn't this your indian grass over here? 
JC: Yeah, that's indian grass. There's another kind of grass 
there too. ( )find a way through. 
GH: Does this orange flower have a name? 
JC: Now when it comes to names of flowers like that, I — yeah, 
but I don't know the name. That's another one, another bloom. 
GH: There's a purple one. 
JC: There you are. I don't know what that is. 
GH: Just flowers? 
JC: To me 
it 
is. 
GH: What about this stuff here? 
JC: That's that same stuff you were looking over there. 
GH: Got a little bush here. 
JC: Mmhm. I don't know what they call 
it. 
GH: So 
is there a bigger patch of grass out that way? 
JC: Well, way off 
in 
there, yeah, 
in 
that swamp back 
in 
there, 
is 
all — there's big areas of grass. 
GH: 
It gets pretty wet? 
JC: Oh yeah. 
GH: What causes the grassy bottom to come up 
in 
this clay? 
JC: Clay, 
in 
the clay bottom. That's where the thing s can grow. 
GH: The water stays on the clay? 
JC: Yeah. Looks like we can go through here. 
GH: 
...blackberry? 
JC: Growing over there? Yeah, blackberries. 
GH: They good to eat too? 
JC: Eat? Oh yeah, sure. Grow wild out here, yeah, they're good. 
GH: What are i.hese flies that have the black on the wing ? 
JC: Pine flies. Web wing . Boy and they bite like a sonofabitch. 
We have the pine flies here and down along the shore they have 
the greenheads — the green ones. They bite worse than a pine fly. 
Pine fly, you can kill 
it, cause it'll stick right to you and you 
can kill 
it ( ) move, but those greenheads down there, man 
they're something. 
GH: So the greenheads are worse than the pine flies? 
JC: I think so. I think so. 
GH: What other kinds of flies do you get? Regular mosquitoes, and 
gnats, and? 
JC: We have very little mosquitos here, very little mosquitoes. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 248 
We had a pretty good season of gnats in 
the last month, 
in 
that 
rainy weather. Oh, some days they were terrible. 
GH: They bite too? 
JC: They nip, they don't really bite. They just nip you enough 
that 
it would make you 
itch and scratch. But the trouble is, 
they 
get 
in to your nose and 
in to your ears, 
in 
your hair, you know. 
They're a nuisance. Won't hurt you much, but... 
GH: Do you have black flies too? 
JC: House fly, you mean? 
GH: No, 
in 
the woods. It's a little tingy biting 
fly. 
JC: 
(uningtelligible) 
GH: ah ha 
JC: Yeah, they bite same as the gnat. Got a little more sting . 
GH: And they're small? 
JC: They're about half the size of a pine fly. Well, maybe a 
little larger than that. 
GH: 
Is some of this swamp rue here? 
JC: Some of this is swamp huckleberry, (unintelligible) 
GH: Do you think it'll 
be a blue? 
JC: I don't know, they might be black ones. They won't be very 
big . 
GH: So the size of 
it depends on the bottom? 
JC: Oh yeah. 
GH: And they got a briar here. Are there different kinds of 
briars? 
JC: Two kinds. You got this leaf, and then you got the other one 
with the stickers. Well, this's got stickers also, but the other 
one's got stingers. 
GH: What do they call the two different kinds? 
JC: I don't know. Bull briar's the one that sticks you. 
JC: 
...is that bark. Nobody'II mess with'em. 
GH: Too much work, easier to go down to the store. 
JC: You know that bull briar, did you ever see the roots of 
it? 
The roots are as white as milk, and apart every foot apart 
there's a great big knob. And that knob 
is what my grandmother 
used to use to make some kind of tea for women's urinary tract. 
She was a nurse. She was a nurse from the other side. She was 
great in 
all 
that kind of stuff. When I was a kid, I remember 
when I was only eight, nine years old, she used to get me out in 
the woods and make me dig up different roots and stuff. 
This 
is your grandmother. How did she learn — from the Indians? 
JC: No, no, she learned from the other side. 
GH: Were any of the other medicines that she used? 
JC: I dug up different roots, but I don't remember the names of 
em. She knew'em. This is poor pine bottom here. This 
is just 
about in 
between the dwarf pine and the big pine. You come here 
twenty years from now, you won't see much difference in 
it. Seems 
like as 
long as I can remember it's been about that size. Fire's 
never been 
in 
here. Never seem to grow — they're stunting. 
GH: Because of the sandy bottom. 
JC: Yeah, there's very little feed. 
GH: Where you find the taller pine, the soil 
is better? 
JC: Oh, yeah. The biggest pine, the nicest looking 
pine, 
is where 
it grows between the oaks. You'll always find pretty good size 
pine between the oaks. You know, oak bottom, that's where your 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 249 
best pine 
is. Where you see solid pine like this, that's ( ). 
GH: You use the pine for lumber? 
JC: Used to, 
yeah. There isn't enough now to bother. They make 
pretty good lumber for framing . Now the further you go towards 
Sim Place, the wetter and richer the bottom is, the pine is 
bigger. 
GH: There some good oak bottom over there we could look at? 
JC: No, there's no oak bottom. But it's just the soil 
is richer, 
makes the pine grow better. 
GH: But not quite rich enough for the oak. 
JC: Those flies bothering you, ain't they? 
GH: Oh, they're coming around. I think they discovered me — it 
wasn't so bad when we first got out. You've been out here so 
long, they've drunk all 
your blood already. What kind of snakes 
are you likely to find around here? 
JC: The pine snake 
is the most ( ) of the dry(?) snake. And then 
you have a black snake with grey ring s around it, 
don't know what 
they call 
it. You have king 
snakes. Then you have the green snake 
-- 
they're the friendliest snake. 
GH: Where do you find the green snake? 
JC: ( )the huckleberry, you'd walk through a patch like this and 
if 
there was a branch here, he'd be 
in 
that branch and just 
before as you approach that branch he'll stick his head out 
in 
front of you. But he won't bother you. 
GH: How big are they? 
JC: They're not very big, only about 18, 20 inches long. 
GH: Just pure green? 
JC: They run about three—quarter inch around. All solid green. 
GH: Ever heard about a snake called a puff adder? 
JC: Oh, yeah, yeah. They're 
in 
the swamp. They're a swamp snake. 
They're .short, some of'em is three, four inches 
in 
diameter. And 
you walk 
in 
the swamp and they'll be taking the sun on top of a 
stump or bottom, he'll dare you to go by there. He won't move. 
Most snakes go when you come, when you approach'em. Not the puff 
adder, he stays right there. 
GH: Are they poisonous? 
JC: I don't — they say they'll give you a little trouble if 
they 
bite you, but they're not poisonous. 
GH: Why do they call'em puff adders? 
JC: Well, they puff right up. 
GH: What colors are they? 
JC: Well usually — they're not a regular pitch black, they got 
little, more like a little grey colored black. 
GH: Do you get the rattlesnakes around here too? 
JC: Yeah, you got the rattlesnakes. But a rattlesnake'll warn you 
if 
you come near him, and you hold your ground, he'll 
go off. 
Won't bother you. 
(unintelligible) there's two kinds of swamp snakes, they ain't 
afraid of nothing . 
GH: And that's the puff adder and? 
JC: The whomper. Have you seen a whomper? Or heard'em? Oh, 
they're a big one. They're short, and great big. and boy, them 
sunofaguns, they're not afraid of anything . 
GH: They're about what — three or four feet long? 
JC: Yeah. Four feet, I never seen one four feet. (unintelligible) 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 250 
GH: Are they fat then, short and fat? 
JC: Short and fat. 
GH: Just like a puff 
JC: Now, my wife's u

night time us boys a

the old candy sto

came over and he sai 
had one of these who 
of 
it, from 12 i 
nche

out of that snake. No one knows why 
something 
hard to believe. But we s 
They're all 
in 
there along the cree 
crossed Beaver Dam Road, where we we 
there 
is where you find'em. We used 
- you know, when I was the ( ) at th 
bridge across these creeks and water 
for lunch and come back, there'd be 
snakes right in 
there, taking the s 
planks. Boy just as soon as they see 
off . 
GH: What'd they look 
like? Do they have stripes on'em? 
JC: No. some of'em are just black. Then they - we have a few 
cottonmouths here too, I've seen cottonmouth up there, water 
snakes also. They're a little poisonous - I don't know if they'd 
kill 
you or not, be they'd give you a lot of trouble. 
GH: They're different from the water snake? 
JC: Yeah. Got a white mouth. 
GH: Do you get garter snakes? 
JC: Oh, we got a variety of garden snakes, my gosh. 
GH: Well I haven't seen a snake yet. I've seen five kinds of 
turtles, and toads and frogs but I haven't seen a snake. 
JC: I seen one the other day 
in 
the swamp where I was - I 
stopped, and I seen his head come out, 
in 
front of the path I was 
going through. He was watching that path. And I was standing there 
and looking - I thought there'd be no end to him. 
I'll 
bet he was 
six, seven feet long. Yeah. 
GH: What kind of snake was that? 
JC: Now that wasn't a whomper and 
it wasn't a adder - I don't 
know what it was. 
It had brown spots on to 
it 
Wasn't a pine 
snake - it was another breed of snake. A long one, and pretty 
good sized, about two inches 
in 
diameter, 
in 
the middle part of 
it 
GH: People used to come down here and catch the snakes and 
turtles and sell'em. Guess they can't do that much anymore. 
JC: Yeah. We still have ( ) and thing s. I don't know if they're 
allowed to anymore, but they still catch'em. Now that's something 
- I never killed a snake. Some people kill every snake they see. 
They get out of your way. 
GH: Are they good for anything ? 
JC: Snake? I don't know - I don't know what they really do, what 
good they do. 
GH: 
Is there some good oak bottom we could visit just for a few 
adder? 
ncle, had charge of the Sim Place cranberry 
oh, probably three(?) years ago, and at 
II 
hung around there together, Warren Grove 
re there. We used to play quoits and 
ers and that, and he - this Buck Holloway 
d boys, I'm gonna show you something. And he 
mpers. And this whomper had 38 snakes 
in side 
s to 18 
inches long. Whether - I don't think 
ned 
it up and he proved to us that he got'em 
or anything 
like that. That's 
een'em. (unintelligible) 
ks. Now where that creek there

to build bridges across those 
e swamp site(?). Built a

four, five, six of them

minutes? 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: What about the cidious bottom? 
JC: Oh no, 
you don't have none of that. It's deciduous stuff. 
GH: Deciduous swamp stuff? 
JC: That's a mixture of upland and swamp. Vicedious { ) 
interfered with somewhere. 
GH: That a kind of white oak there? 
JC: Turkey oak (unintelligible) 
GH: This is all pitch pine through here? 
JC: No, this 
is oak bottom. Oh, that's pitch pine there — that's 
the size pine grows 
in 
oak bottoms. They grow like the — now, 
around that tree, there's a nice one. 
GH: More upland blues and upland blacks. 
JC: Oh, you'll find there's plenty of'em. 
GH: Are the huckleberries different in 
the oak bottom than 
in 
the 
pine bottom? 
JC: Well, usually on the oak bottom you usually find more blue 
ones than black. Pine bottom you get more black ones. 
(unintelligible) 
GH: What minerals are they looking 
for? 
JC: Sand, stone. ( ) oak bottom. 
GH: Rich soil. Here's a lowland blue? 
JC: Red huckleberries. ( ) three. 
GH: But it didn't kill 
it — didn't kill 
all 
of it? 
JC: No, no. 
It was a slow burning 
fire and 
it was early in 
the 
season before the sap started to flow and didn't kill'em. 
( ) 
it's got a very deep split leaf. Now that's turkey oak, now see, 
that's a different leaf, 
now that's got a split leaf 
(unintelligible) Where these have points. 
GH: Points on 
it, 
like that one over there? 
JC: Yeah, that looks like 
it, 
yeah. 
GH: What kind of bark does pin oak have? 
JC: Between a turkey and a white. The only way you can tell 
on 
that 
is the leaf — you can't tell 
on the bark. 
GH: So you've got pin oak and black oak — do you have any red 
oak? 
JC: No. That's one oak we don't have. 
GH: Your turkey oak — what's its 
leaf like? Is 
it 
like the white 
oak? 
JC: No — oh, there 
it is, 
right there. Right there, that's the 
turkey oak. That's the common name, turkey oak, but that's the 
name. I don't know what they call'em, Quercus? 
GH: Quercus something 
or other. 
JC: Quercus one, quercus the other. I know their all quercus, and 
the pine is pinus. 
GH: So this one looks like a pin oak here, maybe. 
JC: 
(unintelligible) 
GH: How do they keep'em from curling 
up? 
JC: I don't know. They wanted'em green, and they wanted'em right 
away, and they treated'em with this dye and stuff, and boy they 
looked pretty. 
GH: So that's the pin oak. That's the only kind they wanted. How 
long ago was that? 
JC: Yeah. Oh, 
it's been forty years ago. 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 252 
GH: And there hasn't been a demand for it since then. 
JC: Oh, there's demand for it, 
but I don't go out. Oh yes, 
somebody supplies it, there's a market. Yeah, right through here 
you'll find all kinds of oak that grow around this place. Very 
little scrub oak 
in 
an area like this — usually open bottom. The 
oak seems to take the nourishment away from everything 
else. The 
only thing you see 
is 
lowland huckleberry brush

TXO1: GH: So the bittersweet red berries just stay on holly(?) all 
year. 
JC: No, they drop off in the spring. 
GH: But the birds don't eat'em? 
JC: I don't know whether they eat'em or not, they say they do. 
But where I've been working and seeing those berries it don't 
look to me 
like, that winter, that the birds has touched'em. 
GH: They just stayed there all winter? 
JC: Yes, they did. Now we go back this way 
JC: 
...that berry set. Very scarce, not too much of 
it around. 
GH: Well, 
if you see some, 
let me know — point it out. 
JC: That's (unintelligible) 
GH: What's the history of this shack here? 
JC: The shacks? They're the shacks that, when the Candlewood(?) 
sawmill started up here, up north end of the town there, they 
built these shacks and had the slaves in'em. 
GH: Goes back that far? 
JC: 
1743. 
GH: And that's cedar shake on that? 
JC: That's — a New York outfit come down here and bought that 
swamp that I own now, up 
in 
there, and they set up a sawmill and 
brought all that cedar lumber to New York. Yup. 
GH: And then the old meeting ground was right in there? 
JC: Camp meeting ground. Yeah, that was 
in 
the tract. Right here 
— now stop here. 
JC: These things are what we call danglers, or bilberries. They 
got big seeds in'em. They got a taste of their own. They're the 
last berry to ripen. 
GH: They grow in the swamp here? 
JC: 
(unintelligible) They got a long stem on'em. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 254 
GH: 
Is that a kind of huckleberry too? 
JC: Yeah, that's a huckleberry. 
GH: What's all 
this brush out here 
in the swamp? 
JC: I don't know what they call that, but that's — we have 
t in 
the cranberry bog. This 
is cranberry bog here. 
GH: I see some cranberries down below. 
JC: Yeah, they're blooming in there 
GH: So this is a wild cranberry bog. 
JC: Yeah we call that hefbrush. Don't know what the name of 
it 
is. 
It starts in a little patch and 
it keeps gettin bigger and 
bigger, bigger and bigger — first thing you know it covers the 
whole thing. 
GH: And then that's the end of your cranberry swamp? 
JC: Yeah. Look at that bloom there. 
GH: Oh, that's nice. Cranberries. Is this your big swamp blue? Or 
dangleberry? 
JC: Yeah, they're a branch of 
it, 
the swamp blue. But they 
wouldn't grow as big here as they do 
in ( ). 
GH: 
Is this the bull briar here? 
JC: There 
it 
is 
right there, yeah. 
GH: Looks like 
it alright. 
JC: That's it. That root 
is ( )white. And long, my gosh. 
GH: The other kind of briar doesn't have the same kind of root? 
JC: No, 
it doesn't. 
GH: 
Is this your own swamp? 
JC: Oh, yeah. 
GH: Look at these ferns down there. 
Is that a particular kind of 
fern? 
JC: They're ferns, that's all 
to me. I never made a big issue out 
of ferns. (unintelligible) 
GH: So you remember where the big bushes are? Are most of the 
ones out here just small and medium sized? 
JC: There's a bush. 
GH: 
Is that a big one? 
JC: That's a good sized berry bush. For a wild berry, yeah. 
JC: No, 
it's not right here. (unintelligible) 
GH: 
Is this another blackberry here? What is this little guy? 
JC: No, 
no that's not a blackberry, that's a special different 
kind of a flower. Don't know the name (unintelligible) 
GH: Does your wife make pies still? 
JC: 
(unintelligible) 
GH: Do you use all 
the different kinds of berries? 
JC: No, no, only swamp blues. The large ones, the blues, yeah, I 
like them. I know a ( ) walk the rows of bushes there, why I got 
four quarts out of one bush. Back 
in there. Got some nice big 
berries. This 
is a big area. This area 
is more high ground — a 
different kind of a swamp, 
it's not swampy, 
it's hard bottom. But 
it still has enough water for berries to grow. 
GH: So 
it dries out 
in the summertime? 
JC: Yeah. 
JC: 
...they were in about an hour, starts to 
itch. I light a 
match and blow it out and put it on to 
it, 
you can feel 
that 
stinger come right out. 
If he's in there for an hour or two, why, 
you have to pull him off ( ) stinger stays there. And then take a 
bottle of alcohol and put 
it right on there and hold 
it there for 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 255 
a little while, and 
it takes the sting away 
GH: They can get real 
infection in there sometimes. So this 
is 
that bush, the poisonous bush, too? 
JC: Yeah, yeah. That's that poisonous stuff. 
GH: Does 
it get a bunch of - a long stick of white flowers, 
later? 
JC: Yeah. 
GH: 
It's poisonous if you touch it? 
JC: Yeah. Poisonous if you eat 
it., 
too. 
GH: Woops, there's a tick. 
JC: On me? 
GH: No, that's not a tick. So here's your bilberry, right? 
JC: Yeah, that's the ( ). 
GH: 
Is that good to eat too? 
JC: Oh yeah. They have a taste of their own. 
JC: 
...pits of'em. Pits by the yard. There's a great big 
blueberry, almost as big as a cultivated berry. 
GH: So some of'em have big seeds and some of'em don't? The 
huckleberries? 
JC: Oh yeah, some of'em don't have hardly any seeds. They're so 
small you don't even notice'em. 
GH: Which ones are those? 
JC: Swamp blues - the swamp blues are good. The upland blues have 
larger seeds than swamp blues. 
GH: So 
is this your 
GH: How long ago... 
JC: 
It's not a natural savannah bottom. 
GH: How long ago was 
it cleared off? 
JC: 
1910 or 12. 
GH: 
Is that the savannah grass growing up 
in there? 
JC: Well, that's a species of savannah grass, but I don't think 
it's savannah grass cause 
it grows too tall. Savannah grass don't 
grow that tall. 
It grows 
in wet bottom, you know, but I think 
it's a different kind of grass. See and that fern over there, 
that's a different kind of fern than grows 
in the upland. 
GH: So that deciduous swamp - they got deciduous bottom? 
JC: They have the deciduous 
GH: They got vicidious swamp and vicidious upland, both disturbed 
by humans. 
JC. Yup. 
GH: So on the upland, what kind of tree comes 
in after the 
disturbance there? 
JC: Pine, mostly pine on oak bottom. Pine seed is easier to 
distribute than acorns - the wind carries pine seeds, where 
acorns have to be carried by animals or humans. 
GH: 
Is that a wild cherry behind you there? 
JC: Yeah, yeah, there was one hanging over there - the birds they 
(unintelligible) and they sprout up. You'll find wild cherry 
everywhere. 
GH: How's the fruit, 
is that any good to eat? 
JC: Yeah, sure. Wild cherry? We had a couple Hungarians living 
in 
Warren Grove years ago, they made wild cherry wine. I'll tell you 
- used to work, used to come here in the ( ) and shoot(?) this 
when 
it was clean - this'd be flooded in the wintertime with 
water. I took the gates off and flood that, and then when the ice 
Hunn--$4 Audiocassette logs 
page 256 
got around six inches thick, we used to cut the ice and fill 
the 
ice houses up. These Hungarians made this cherry wine, and they'd 
bring jugs, gallon jugs of tea mixed with wine, with this cherry 
wine. I tell you, 
it was some good, too. That was good. 
GH: So they'd wait until 
late 
in the fall to get the cherries? 
JC: Yeah, when the cherries are ripe there, 
in September. They'd 
put a sheet down on the ground and get up there, rake'em right 
off the tree. 
It was a lotta work. Them two boys — two brothers — 
lived by themselves. Boy, they knew how to farm, they knew how to 
do a lot of things that the native people 
GH: Did they move on then? 
JC: No, they died off. 
GH: 
Is this grassy bottom in here too? 
JC: Yeah. Yeah, that's tough grass, too. 
GH: That's not the savannah? 
JC: No, that's not savannah. 
GH: Do you have any of those cactus or prickly pears that grow 
around here? 
JC: No cactus here, no. 
It grows here — got a fellow at Sim Place 
— Antels(?) — they brought some in from out west where they took 
a trip out to California and on their travels they picked up some 
of that cactus and planted it up there, and 
it growed good. 
GH: But it's not native around here? 
JC: No. 
JC: You don't even pay attention to the different things around 
here when you're working, you know. Your mind 
is on what you're 
doing. And of course once 
in a while you get across something 
that you don't see, 
like a flower that looks extra pretty or 
something like that, you kinda go, hey — but, you know what it 
is. 
GH: 
it's mostly the things that you use 
in some way that you've 
got a name for. 
JC: As far as names of different plants, my wife knows more, 
remembers names better than I do. Yeah 
GH: You seem to know a lot of them. 
JC: Peppergrass, I used to sell a lot of peppergrass. This used 
to be covered with the peppergrass, babybreath along that edge, I 
used to bundle that up and sell 
it. When I was — there was a good 
market for that stuff. 
GH: Who did you sell that to? 
JC: Same outfit, up there 
in Tappan. (Whiting? Allyn's Manufactory? 
ed.) 
GH: And they don't do business anymore? 
JC: Oh yeah, they're 
in business — I imagine they are, I haven't 
done anything for — I quit all 
that stuff. When I got in the 
sawmill and cedar business, I just dropped a lot of this other 
stuff . 
GH: 5:30 PM. Leaving Jack Cervetto's after a couple of hours of 
poking through the woods and getting ticks all over us, and what 
he calls the pine fly, which 
is an upland version of the 
greenheaded fly of the salt swamps. I think I may have finally 
gotten savannah grass. It's just a few of'em with — some kind of a 
carex, sedge — has yet to be 
identified. Got some interesting 
information about snakes. Find that Jack's a little confused from 
time to time on the oaks — he seems to rely most heavily on the 
Nunn--B4 Audiocassette logs 
page 257 
bark. I can tell generally he 
looks past the 
eaves and trying to 
get a look at the bark, and sometimes that fools him I think, 
into calling various kinds of things turkey oak, which are really 
white oak or black oak. I'm not really sure what he has 
in mind 
for turkey oak. The triple white oak, that marker on the edge of 
his property, 
in fact is a post oak, which 
is what Tom Brown 
calls turkey oak. So things are a little bit confusing. Pin oak 
is 
no doubt the scarlet oak, and that he relies on the leave 
shape for, as he noted. Here we're going through this burnt over 
area that's just coming up with a thick growth of blackjack oak 
about a foot or two high. As far as the huckleberries and 
blueberries are concerned, we're making some progress here. 
There's a bit of over—differentiation in terms of size, but the 
upland blue huckleberry or .sugar huck 
is clearly focused on 
Vacinium vacilans, though Gelusacia fondosa found 
in that habitat 
that wasn't growing very tall, was lumped with it. But later down 
in 
the swamp we came across 
it, 
and he quite spontaneously 
identified it as dangle or bilberry, referring to the long, 
dangling inflorescence. He said that was the lates to mature, 
which is probably true. Then the upland black huckleberry is 
Ga.lusacia demosa, focused on that certainly. And then the swamp 
blue, the tall swamp blue huckleberry, 
is Vacinium corumbosum, no 
doubt including as well caesariens. And then the black one which 
he says 
is not nearly as good as the swamp blue, the only one 
worth using in pies, 
is Vacinium atricocum. We saw several of 
those, clearly distinguished by their lack of ocalocus{?} bloom 
or color to the ripening, the green fruits. So the big , medium 
and small blues, the swamp blues and swamp blacks refer 
apparently to 
individual variation within the species, corumbosum 
and atricocum, respectively. And then the grassberry of course 
is 
Galusacia demosa. So that covers all 
the bases quite nicely. He's 
got a number of other kinds of foliage mixed up, 
like inkberry 
and bayberry, he's certainly confused about that. He identified 
the flowering inkberry as bayberry, and described a black fruit 
that it'll have just like inkberry. So his bayberry seems to 
apply quite consistently to 
inkberry. But then he refers to 
inkberry as a different kind of plant, and I'm not sure what he 
might be using the term for, at this point. Then his killcalf is 
Lyonia 
mariana, and whether it 
is poisonous, I have no 
idea. The 
poisonous sheepsol 
is usually — sheep laurel 
is usually 
identified as the poisonous one. But he clearly distinguished 
sheep laurel, and didn't say anything about it being poisonous. 
And distinguished it from the regular lauge► by the color of the 
flower and so forth. Then the other poisonous plant that he 
referred to but did not know the name, 
is Clethra alnefolia, and 
what basis there is for considering it poisonous I don't know. 
His pine classification is quite interesting. There's bull pine 
of the swamps, scrub pine of the plains, and pitch pine of the 
uplands, and among those he distinguishes a pitch pine that grows 
particularly tall 
and large on oak. bottom. The two—needle, three— 
needle distinction doesn't seem to be of much significance to 
him, and so he seems to be distinguishing primarily ecotypes of 
the pitch pine and perhaps the virginia pine and two—needle pine 
are rare 
in his area. But he — I saw little sign of either in 
that area. The snakes are curious — somebody should have done a 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 258 
study somewhere along the 
line of 
local snake nomenclature. The 
whomper and the puff adder in particular, and perhaps the 
cottonmouth deserves treatment in that context, as applying to 
some local 
snake with a white mouth. And the distinction between 
the bull briar and the regular briar — the regular briar is 
clearly Glauca, with only weak spines and silvery undersides to 
the 
leaves. I'm not sure 
i£ the silvery undersides — Glaucas 
underside — is definitive at all, or whether regular briar is a 
residual category including all but the bull briar, which is 
the 
one with very heavy thorns. It's claimed to have medicinal 
properties in 
the roots, treating urinary track problems in the 
female. And the big milky white fruit nodules of the briar — in 
fact we saw a briar root with such knobs on 
it at Brad 
Thompson's blueberry patch. The mysterious cidious bottom turns 
out to be deciduous bottom, and there are upland and swamp 
subvarieties. Deciduous swamp, or cidious swamp, 
is dominated by 
the maple that comes up and will squeeze out the cedar after 
human disturbance creates the opening, while 
in 
the uplands it's 
more like pine that comes up after the human disturbance, and 
characterizes the upland cidious bottom. That fits pretty well 
with the way he was describing it before, I just didn't perceive 
the significance of what he was saying. It's curious, the 
resemblance in terms of the treatment of wild flowers and things 
of that sort by Jack Cervetto, 
in particular. So the grass pink, 
which 
is a more Limodorum I guess, very showy orchid that grows 
in 
the marshy places, he's seen it around but 
it has no 
idea what 
it 
is. Same with Poligola oria, which 
is just a flower as far as 
he's concerned. He consented to the use of that phrasing at 
least, but didn't offer it spontaneously. Likewise the sundews, 
narrow leaf sundew — yeah, I've seen that but I don't know what 
it 
is. When it comes to those kinds of things, he just hasn't 
bothered to 
learn the names.

IY,01:GH: Sunday, June 24th and we're looking at a fyke net that 
he made. When did you make this fyke net? 
BL: This one here's been done quite a good while, but the ones I 
net myself, I just made 'em this last year. And I put - this 
is a 
newer one, see, with little short ( ) I knitted this to make 
it 
longer for here, see. 
GH: 
Is this an older style? 
BL: Well, no. 
It's .just the same as I made when I was a little 
boy seven years old. I knit 
'em myself when I was seven years old. 
My dad started it, 
and I tell 
you how he started it. 
(unintelligible)have to go 
like this, see, the size mesh you 
wanted. Then you go your needle through - if you had a big 
lot of 
meshes and 
it was gonna have a twenty mesh around, you'd have 
fifty here, then you put the string through like that you know. 
Now this 
is when I was a little fellow, you used 18 thread cotton 
twine, you couldn't buy no net 
in them days you know. And I net 
my own fykes and I made four of 
'em - they were made out of 
cotton, and they didn't last very long. But look 
GH: 
Is this made of cotton? 
BL: Just hold that - get right 
in 
the middle, right in 
the middle 
of 
it where it's - that's it. And you - see, the 
idea 
is, 
is 
you 
go work: and put that down that way, see, and your bait string is 
here - see here's +,he bait - and here's where the snappers goes 
in, 
see, and when they get in, 
then they can't find their way 
back out, cause there's all 
this going around everywhere, see. So 
this, when they hit this, 
if 
their head goes out, their shell 
fetches up on 
it there, 
like that, see. So that's the 
idea of the 
whole thing. And this in here, you undo this and dump 'em out on 
the sand, see. 
GH: What do you dump 'em into - do you have a special bag that you 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 260 
carry 'em back 
in with? 
BL: Oh yeah, we have bags that we put 
'em in and tie 
'em up. You 
dump one out and take it by the tail, see, put it 
in 
the bag 
I 
had I think it was nine, 
in 
the fyke one day, and they all 
weighed about 15 pound apiece. Well, I had 45 dollars worth — in 
one of them f 
ykes. 
GH: 45 bucks worth. How much a pound? 
BL: I believe that we got 35 cents — then we got 40 last year, 
see. 1 think we — it could have been 25 cents a pound. Anyhow 
GH: That's the 
live weight? 
BL: Oh yeah. We sell 
'em right there at Bailey. 
GH: Bailey takes your snappers too? 
BL: Oh yeah. And then they clean 'em there — I never clean 'em 
myself. My dad used to clean 'em, you know. There's something else 
here I wanted to show you. I was going on and do this — it could 
take me a minute, but you see 
if you put that that way, see, 
like 
that, they can go to work and work this off. And when they work: 
it off 
GH: The turtles can work the knots loose. 
BL: From inside, working out. What it does, when it comes out 
there's nothing here. But if 
you go this way, see that way, and 
if 
he works it off, see out here, see here's another knot and he 
still can't get out. 
GH: 
OP; so there's a way of tying the knot 
BL: Yeah, I learnt that myself. Cause one day a big snapper get 
in, 
and I'd come and this'd all 
be undone and the snapper's gone, 
he'd go right on out. Cause this opens up big, see. 
GH: How could a snapper — a snapper's smart enough to figure that 
out? 
BL: Oh, 
he — no, he didn't figure out anything, he's just trying 
to get out and he pushes and he pushes, and he's powerful. Awful 
powerful — he'd tear your { } all 
to pieces — see, by his 
toenails. But just for fun — now this 
is awful tight, so, but 
I'll 
try to undo it. I don't know why thi
s one 's so ti
g ht, I 
can't figure it. 
GH: What kind of wood is around here, do you know? 
BL: I imagine that that is gum. I generally use either oak or 
hickory, because oak and hickory last so 
long, and they're stout, 
and 
it bends good. Maple and gum are soft wood and they don't 
last so 
long. 
GH: Did you ever make those eel — those split oak basket for 
BL: No, but my wife's grandfather, I mean grandmother, she kept 
house for this man and she lived with him, and he used to make 
'em 
and sell 
'em 
I've had several of 
'em, 
like that, but they never 
see 
em anymore nowadays, 
it's so much easier. Down there, I was 
gonna show you my eel 
pot, I have one set and I also had one 
started. You know. But I make my own, see, I have the net but 
I'll 
tell 
you what happened. I made thirty, always kept five 
working on each day and then put 'em there the next day — cotton 
you know, had to dry 
'em each day — and when a week went by I 
would have five a day and I would shift and that would make a 
complete shift, see. And the 
little pots — and I copper painted 
'em, 
like that. So I made thirty, and they stoled 27 of 
'em, 
and 
left me three. That was a whole winter's work, while I was 
trapping. I said I'll never another one. I got one started down 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 261 
there about fifteen year ago, and I never finished 
+.. 
So I yet 
this wire — oh, 
it's about that deep, you know, 
like fine mesh, a 
half inch. And I got enough to put three whirls(?) and I don't 
have to put no hoops 
in — that's for the eel 
pots, see. Then 
it 
holds everything. I put the 
inner funnel 
in first, and then the 
outer funnel, and tail 
end just like this. 
GH: So, the eel 
pot looks just like this Tyke? 
BL: Looks like this, only it's smaller, not very big around. 
GH: And a smaller mesh? 
BL: Today I only got one eel 
out of the eel 
pot and there's 
thousands of 
'em down there. Something's happened this year. Now I 
could tell you what happened, I know no one else knows, but it 
was my doing — they made me mad, they cut my eelpots adrift. And 
five year ago, I killed all 
the eels in that part of the bay. ( ) 
by the millions. And I says, three years, and there won't be any 
eels. But this 
is 
the fifth year, and the old ones lasted through 
last year, and they come to all clean up this year and there's no 
eels. So that millions that I killed — a dirty trick, you may 
say, but what the hell, they cut my eel 
pots adrift and throwed 
'em overboard. I only had the four, see, made me mad. Cause I was 
quit eeling, you know, I didn't have any boat. 
GH: How'd you kill 
all 
the eels? 
BL: Well, 
if 
it ever got out they might shoot me. 
GH: Well, we'll keep 
it quiet. I went to work and used this fine 
stuff, that fine net. And I used laundry bag for funnels and an 
eel 
this long couldn't get out. I took four eel 
pots and I set 
'em, 
and I know they had two and three thousand 
in each one, that 
way, and I ( ) leave 
'em overboard till 
they smothered, and then 
dump 
'em out. 
I'd take 'em up and dump 'em 
in salt, and then I'd 
dump 'em 
in the woods around. Oh, I went into the tons that I 
killed. A good many thousand of eels, 
like this, a hundred, two 
hundred per pound, you know like that. So I says, 
if' 
I can't have 
a eel 
pot, they're not gonna have any eel. You see when I was a 
little boy, that's what we done. Was eel, and we skinned the 
eels. Now what we down, we'd have a live car(?) and put a hole 
in 
it, 
like that, and made 
it big so the eels could go out unless 
they weighed close to half pound — we could skin every one of 
'em. 
And shipped 'em into New York. Train left Leesburg at 11, I think 
it was 11 
o'clock, Monday morning and we would start at midnight 
Sunday night and we'd skin — every week we'd ship two barrels of 
eels. Now if 
we had a bad week they'd be smaller barrels, that'd 
be a hundred and fifty pound a barrel, 
if we had a good week it'd 
be four hundred pound, two hundred pound each of a barrel. My dad 
had the store and he had lots of barrels. 
GH: What were the barrels — wooden barrels? 
BL: Yeah, they were wooden. This was back in 
1910, 
15, 
along 
in 
there, up until 
in 
the 1920s. Just imagine — we never got less 
than 18 cents a pound, and we got as much as 24 cents a pound. 
That: was the most we got. I remember who we shipped 'em to — T. 
W. 
Mitchell Company in New York. They give us 24 cents. Now just 
imagine the money that you'd get out of three hundred pound of 
eels, or four, and wages only a dollar a day. 
If you work on the 
farm or the hay meadow, 
if you went on the oyster boat, you got 
thirty dollars a month. But you got your grub on a oyster boat, 
see. Yet here we'd get all 
that money for just the eels. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 262 
GH: How long did 
t take you to catch 
end skin that many eels? 
BL: Oh, we would — my dad wouldn't work on Sunday. He'd — we'd go 
after midnight Sunday nig 
seine — the seine oh, may 
And we'd put it 
in a live 
Sunday night. Then we'd g 
meantime, everybody smoke 
tobacco, that's the men — 
around, gather up all 
the 
put that in the eels and 
of 
'em. The nicotine or s 
and skin 
'em. Dad would s 
ht. And twice a day we would haul 
this 
be, 
long as your car, right fine mesh. 
car, see, and keep 
'em till midnight 
o get ( ), 
bring 'em up, and we — in the 
d or chewed tobacco — everybody used 
women no, 
not like today. 
So, I'd go 
se cigarette butts, 
like that, and we'd 
in about an hour that'd kill every one 
omething from th'em. Then we'd sit there 
kin the big ones and I'd skin like your 
thumb or a little bigger you know like that. We'd skin them out — 
wouidn't take no time to skin 
GH: How do you skin 'em? Use a knife? 
BL: I don't have one here. You take a knife — let's say this was 
the head — and you go this way, see. Just below the fins right 
here you cut through there to the backbone. And you make one slit 
down here, see. And then you just take that, all 
the insides 
comes out like that, and then you take your knife and right here, 
break that backbone, push 
it 
like that, and you take and pull the 
hide off. And you can skin one that quick, quick as I told you, 
my dad would skin an eel. 
GH: How long did eels get, the real 
big ones? 
BL: Four pound was the biggest one my dad ever got. 
GH: How long would that be? Three feet? 
BL: But they generally weigh half a pound to a pound, see. Little 
ones 
like that, by the millions. But they'd not have 
'em 
everywhere — we had 
'em down here. Well, there's so much about it 
that could be told, one thing and another. You see we only used a 
dozen eel 
pots then. We used the haul 
seine. And they wouldn't, 
them big eels wouldn't let go of that eel pot, them two pound 
ones 
like that. But when you haul, you catch every one of 
'em, 
see. And we would do 
it twice 
GH: Haul 
in the seine 
BL: 
I'll 
tell you what always, that I hated. Go out in the middle 
of the day, nice and warm you know, and have your wet clothes and 
all, come 
in and take 'em off and ( ) the boat, you know. Then you 
go out at midnight, put them on — talk about cold and wet 
clothes. Oh did I hate that. But you'd do about two hours on the 
ebb tide, we'd go from one crik to the other crik, from Dennis 
Crik to West Crik to Ray's(?) Ditch and then up the river and 
then right on up to Hansey, up that way. We never went up 
it 
to 
Hansey, we went to Back Crik, was as far as we went. And then 
we'd put 'em right 
in the 
live car, right quick. 
GH: What's a live car? 
BL: Live car 
is just like a little batteau(?), with hundreds of 
holes 
in 
it. You have a door on top, right in the middle on top. 
Dump 'em 
into 
it, 
then when you get ready to take 
'em out, you pul 
that up on the bank and you have a scoop net — I got one down 
there 
in the trailer you know, still got the bag 
in 
it, where I 
scooped the eels in 
it, 
I still got 
it 
GH: We'll have to visit you another time, to get a look at 
BL: Anyway, I think I still have that. I like that for different 
things, you know, that net. Scoop 'em out and put 'em 
in. Then we 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 263 
had these here 
opper bottom washboards about so 
ong, handle on 
each end, and we'd get a couple of them and we'd — you can't pul: 
in 
so many cause they go out over the top, see — and we take 
'em 
and we'd dump 'em 
in barrels like that and bring 'em up home. And 
them days there was a basket factory there. Right the end of 
Moore's Beach road, then on the left come right out to the 
highway, this basket factory ( )my dad , and his brother and his 
brother—in—law and his dad before owned 
it, 
see. And we'd go 
in 
there, and them days they didn't have a spray gun to spray for 
mosquitos but they had the black flag, that was the principal 
one, that powder. And that smell, they'd put a little bit here 
and a little bit there, 
like that, and set 
it afire. And it would 
burn a long time, nice odor, you could smell 
it, 
but boy the 
mosquitos didn't like it. That's where we'd skin our eels. 
Especially 
if 
it was 
in 
the night, you know — we didn't have no 
flashlights then, you always had the lantern and you carried 
it 
by hand. 
GH: So to keep the mosquitos away you'd burn black flag. 
BL: Yeah. 
GH: Were the mosquitos real bad? 
BL: Mosquitos bad? Oh my god they'd pretty near smother you. We 
knew how to best 'em, see. Moore's Beach Road, they don't bother 
us, 
they bother everybody else. But the mosquitos and the 
strawberry flies — today when I was down there, I took — there 
it 
is, 
that jug, you see it? That's kerosene, and I just use 
it, 
don't use no flit gun or anything. Everything that shows ( ) I 
put a little bit of kerosene. The mosquitos can't stand 
it and 
none of them flies can't. Back — the trailer in the back — 
they'll eat you up. But they come out there, boy they don't 
bother you. 
GH: Do you light the kerosene? 
BL: Oh no, 
no. Leave it, 
so they smell 
it. 
I could put 
it here, 
course we don't have any here, not anything except just between 
sunset and dark, 
like that. But you know what we always did, when 
we worked for ourself, there's so much — oh my god, about them 
bunkers I told you about. 
I'd 
love to tell 
you the 
last day, what 
happened to 
'em. 
GH: I saw some bunkers down there today at Bailey's. We stopped 
at Bailey's and talked to him, we thought you might show up. And 
he had some bunkers somebody had brought in. 
So I know what they 
look 
like now. 
BL: She didn't hear about the bunkers. But the last day, well I 
think the day before the 
last day, I went out on the flood tide, 
the fresh crik (creek, ed.) — that's Campbell's — and soon as I went 
down to 
the crik out there, just a eighth of a mile, no further, the 
water was splashing just like this. These little bunkers that 
long, 
little fish and weakfish, were swimming, only this deep. 
And they'd go by the thousands. So I went, soon's I started I run 
right slow and easy, 
run my net overboard, and these here 
weakfish and bluefish, most of 
'em that big, would through water 
in my fare, over the outboard motor — that close they were, that 
fish, they'd hit that net and splash the water. And I could gauge 
about how much net I'd want — I only wanted about three, four 
hundred pounds, that's all I wanted without ice, you know. But 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 264 
I d r i it overboard. And I was going to make two nets this next 
day. Got my set that day and come 
in, 
two o'clock that night I 
went out. 
In the morning, put my net overboard and never felt a 
fish. Swimming at the net, you know. I waited until 
it gets 
daylight - everything was funny, white, no matter where you 
look 
it wasn't light but yet everything was white, 
like snow - as 
if 
everything was snow. Come to find out when it got a little bit 
lighter, here was all 
the bunkers and baby ( ) dead and there 
wasn't no fish. And so I went - tell you what I done - I put my 
net 
in, 
and I went in, called the game warden. And then I went 
back out and I took a bucket - now look, just one red bucket, -
now these bunkers was three, four mile that way, three, four mile 
that way and I don't know how far offshore but I could see for a 
mile, everything white. As far down 
in the water as you can see, 
they was dead. Little fellows about that big. Afternoon before 
they was all 
alive. So I went and took a bucket, scooped it up, 
set 
it 
in the boat. I took a quart jar and filled that, put a lid 
on so I could take it home and put 
it 
in 
the freezer, so they 
could, you know, find out what was the matter. And I went to 
Woodbine, got something to eat, and Bill Boyce the tax assessor 
down there, he wanted - I put I think: 
it was two hundred in the 
jar, and he must have had four or five hundred - you know, he 
wanted 'em for bait, I don't know if he used 'em or not. Out of one 
scoop, and that went for miles, there was so many - billions, 
trillions like that, and we never had any - from that day to 
this, that was the end of the bunkers. 
GH: Remember what the year was when that happened? 
BL: I believe 
it was 
in the 30s, could of been the 40s. Been 
several year ago now. You know like that. And boy 
it was a dirty 
rotten shame, what they done. Just a handful of people 
in 
the 
mosquito commission, and thousands of people out of their ,.lobs. 
Cause 
it was the most valuable oil, I guess, there ever was. And 
it was renewable, didn't cost anything. Fish factories everywhere 
from Florida to Maine, you know, hundreds of 
'em, 
and every one 
had to go out of business. The bunkers are gone, turned 
everything upside down, about the flukes(?) and the sharks and 
everything else you know. That was positively awful. But anyway 
GH: So they used to use the bunker for oil? Is that why they 
called it bunkers - bunker oil? 
BL: Well, menhaden is the right name, but we always called 'em 
bunkers, musk bunkers we called 'em, see. 
GH: Why did you call 
'em that? 
BL: Well, 
to tell 
you the truth I don't know. I might have one 
in 
here - I know I had two 
in my net this morning, I put 'em 
in a eel 
pot, but I'll 
look ... This net I took up this morning. I don't 
believe I got 
GH: This one doesn't have the brick weights on the bottom. 
BL: Well, I took 'em off. See, that one there, that's got one left 
on 
it. What I want to show you, 
is a hole that I just mended. I 
mended it yesterday. 
GH: So you work on your nets every day, mending your nets? 
BL: No, 
no, whenever I get a chance to take one up. I got - had a 
hole here somewhere. If you see some yellow twine. 
GH: How long 
is this net? 
BL: Well, this one 
is about ten or fifteen fathom. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 265 
GH: Ten or f fteen fathom -? 
BL: Yeah, that's six feet to a fathom, 60 feet 
ong, ten fathom. 
My 
license says thirty fathom. Three dollars for a thirty fathom 
net, and I got one for three of em. 
GH: That's every year you have to pay that three dollars? 
BL: See I got that cut out? 
GH: How did that get cut out? 
BL: Why I cut 
it with a knife 
Look it's all 
ready to mend. Would 
you 
like to see 
it mended? 
Sure. 
GH:

on the trees here are for mending nets? 
that's where I hung it. But just for fun, 
ight there. Just take ahold of that, I want 
g. 
Now watch, you see that, see that thing 
n in the bottom, see 
it? Alright now you 
go backward and forwards, and you take this 
re you stop. That's the starting place and 
u have to have two 
in a hole. 
If you got five 
go get my needle.... 
needles? 
BL: No, I buy them. 
GH: Did you ever make them? 
BL: Years ago we made 'em out of a cigar box, yeah, we made our 
own. You buy 
'em for about sixty(?) cents apiece. 
GH: Now they're fifty cents apiece? 
GH: So you never have to use a net gauge, you just eyeball 
it? 
BL: You see where I started, a place, I tell 
you I double knot it 
because 
it slips, but I guess at the meshes. Here's a different 
kind of a knot, but you see you put it there, you can only do 
it 
when you got a knot. And you hold it, 
and you go around there, 
see. Now I always put this extra — with cotton you wouldn't have 
to. And everytime there's a place like this, you've got to take 
it up, 
if you don't it'll 
come out wrong. See. Don't take much 
longer. 
It's a double knot. 
GH: Now have you taught anybody how to do this? 
BL: Well, my wife, I showed her. She can mend but she can't go 
right on and on and on 
in a big hole — she does a little bit here 
and a little bit there you know. But you never get wrong if you 
take your time. No three nor five per(?) meshes — if 
you do 
you're wrong. 
GH: That's the same way you would make a fyke net too, right? 
BL: Well, a whole lot, but you just go around and around and 
around, with a fyke. See, about pretty near done, that hole. But 
you see, now you watch, 
it'll 
come out right where I told you. I 
always cut the whole hole out, you know, before I start to mend. 
GH: You cut it square? 
BL: Well, I — you cut the way 
it 
is 
to make it come out, 
if 
it's 
ragged you know. It's got to be done a certain way. Now you see 
this here other place, see 
it right down there, broken mesh? 
That's all 
there is 
left of 
it. 
GH: Who taught you how to do this? 
BL: Why a old fisherman by the name of Joby Heritage. When I was 
a little fellow, about seven or eight year old, he showed my dad. 
Hunn--S4 Audiocassette logs 
page 266 
But none of 
'em 
in the family cou d ever get 
it done right. See, 
they couldn't cut the hole out and figure ahead. But as I say, I 
never had a hole yet I couldn't mend. Nowadays. But after you do 
something for sixty, seventy year, you got to know something. 
There's no holes in this, but I could get a hole there - well, 
not necessarily 
GH: There's a little one. 
BL: Well, I don't mend them. 
GH: How about this one here? 
BL: Yeah, now this one here I do see, but I already cut it out, 
see. Just the same, start here and go here, here, come back right 
here, the 
last one. You smell something sweet? 
GH: Yeah, what is that? 
BL: I don't know, a bee of some kind. 
GH: A big one. What other kinds of fishing do you do during the 
year? You do bunkers this time of the year, eels, what else? Can 
you take us around through the year, all 
the things you do? 
BL: 
In the spring, the first thing, we have perch and rock here 
all 
winter. See, they stay here all winter, especially perch you 
:now. And then we catch shad 
in the spring. 
GH: Rock, that's the striped bass? 
BL: Uhhuh. Well, they've got a law now, you can sell 
'em but your 
daren't catch em, with a nat, see. We caught one this spring, 
now, first one we caught, was 
in March. About that long - it was 
legal, 
it was 18 inches long, 
it weighed three pound, just a 
little over three pound and a half - and they give us ten dollars 
for 
it. Three dollars a pound, see. Then we caught two or three 
more, but we saved 'em - you had a right to have em, you had a 
right to sell 
em, but you didn't have a right to catch 'em 
in the 
net. You can catch 'em on a line after the first of March, after 
the season come 
in, 
but we wasn't gonna throw 'em away, that was a 
sure thing. But we didn't catch many, three or four. Last year we 
didn't catch a one. And shad, we had five shad, they weighed I 
think 
it was fifteen pound, they give us five cents a pound. And 
if 
you had to buy 
it, 
it'd cost you at least two or three dollars 
a pound. 
GH: Who was that., Bailey? 
BL: Yeah. Course, that's all 
it's worth 
in the market. But they 
don't give you according to - well, they clean em, 
one thing and 
another, see. 
GH: That was back 
in March, you were catching shad 
in March? 
BL: Yeah 
GH: Then what? 
BL: Several year ago - I was gonna try and think what year -
anyhow, about fifty year ago, I was catching Cape May goodies. 
Spots, they call 
'em 
in Philadelphia, Lafayette and New York. And 
I was catching a thousand, fifteen hundred pound a day. And I 
upset an automobile. Model A, 
it was the first one we had after 
the Model T. They had a drop center rim(?) - if you ever look-
back into history and everything - and they was awful dangerous. 
People didn't know - I didn't know it. And I had two of the girls 
- three of the girls I think 
it was - on the seat along side of me, 
and their dad was on the running board. I was taking 'em home, and 
I was driving forty five mile an hour, see. 
(end of side one - recording stops about 2/3 along tape) 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 267 
BL: 
...and when I put my foot on the brake, you know what 
happened? That drop center rim, the tire come off and nothin but 
the rim. And the good tire — I'd be on this side — it took, 
because, she went that way, dug a hole that deep right in the 
gravel road. I put my brake on, and 
it just went huh! just slid 
like that, and went over that way and right back on her feet. But 
it caught my arms, and I shoulda turned the elbow — the elbow was 
here — turned 
it back, you know. So she took the boat, cause I 
had that bound, around here see. After they took the x—rays and 
things. And it was five weeks 
it was taped right there, and I 
never moved it. And then 
it was another about five weeks, I 
couldn't straighten it out, you know. So anyway, she took the 
boat, took one of the boys, always helped me you know — teenager. 
And she took as many fish — one day one of the main ones had 1500 
pound and she had 1500 pound just the same. She took that boat, 
would go out at two o'clock 
in 
the morning, (unintelligible) on 
three nets, see — we used six fifty fathom nets. And pull 
out 
before daylight, and clean it out, and then they would pull they 
would pull 
the other one and go up the river, about ten, twelve 
mile up the river. One would steer the boat and the other would 
clean the fish out and go up there and put 'em out. Come back in 
the afternoon, and I'd go out with 'em and put the net overboard, 
anchor it — they used to anchor each end, you know like that. And 
that's what she done for about a month. She fished that boat. 
GH: What's her name? 
BL: Pauline. Pauline Irene Lane. That was Pauline Irene Scull, 
see 
GH: How long ago did you get married? 
BL: 61 years last March. 61. ( )fiftieth, we thought that was no 
good — well, we had our golden wedding anniversary and doggoned 
if 
we didn't get ten more. And another one. But you know, I feel 
just as good — I feel better, than I did when I was 21. When I 
was 21 I had bad teeth and one thing and another, and I pretty 
near lived on 
ice cream. Seems as though I couldn't enjoy a meal 
and one thing and another, you know, 
like that — and I'd eat 
about a quart of 
ice cream every day. I kept going all 
the time, 
you know. And nowadays I eat anything I want, any amount I want. 
But I pretty near went to 
it, 
year before last. 
GH: Do you 
like to eat a lot of fish? 
BL: Oh my god, yeah. 
GH: So you don't just catch em, you also eat em? 
BL: See 
if I got... There's a bunker. There's a weakfish I caught 
yesterday. 
GH: 
I'd 
like to get a picture of the weakfish. You want to hold 
it up so we can see the head there? Let me 
lay 
it pout here. 
BL: See that blue fish? You can't hardly tell 
it from a bunker. 
GH: Are they relatives do you think? 
BL: No. This 
is the mackerel family. And this, I don't know what 
it would be. This 
is awful oily and full 
of bones. You can eat 
it, 
as far as that goes. But it's awful oily. Now that's one of 
the best fish there 
is. 
GH: This 
is a bluefish? 
BL: Yeah that's a bluefish. 
I'd like to tell 
you a tale about 
that. When I was a boy, this fish here was one hundred dollars a 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 268 
barrel. But they genera 
Iy was big 
like this, see. Now that w,is a 
hundred dollars a barrel, 
it was a two hundred pound barrel, that 
was fifty cents a pound. Today they're only worth five or ten 
cents a pound. 
GH: Why's that? 
BL: People died off — people don't like em. They don't know what 
it's all 
about. You've got to take these fish and cook 
'em fresh -
I'd rather have them than I would these. Far as that goes. 
GH: So weakfish is 
real popular now? 
GH: You would rather eat bluefish than weakfish? 
BL: Oh, yeah, much rather. 
GH: You want to hold that bluefish up so I can get a shot of the 
head? 
BL: No, they don't fasten 
in the net, now, the butterfish. 
GH: They don't fasten in 
the net? They just come and go? 
BL: No. They're like a flounder. We don't catch flounder nor 
butterfish 
GH: Do they have a way of getting out of the net? 
BL: Yeah, they don't have no gill. But weakfish and bluefish, 
they're gilled. 
'Bout these snappers. Ever wants know anything, I 
can tell 
you something great about catching snappers. If you got a 
pond — let's say square, from here to that garage over there you 
know. Let's say there's five or six snappers in that pond, and 
you want to catch em. You set a fike — you catch one or two the 
first night, and maybe you have to shift it, 
and catch another 
one, and 
in a week or so you'll catch 'em all. But, 
if you wanta 
catch 'em all 
the first night, 
I'll 
tell you how to do 
it. Get 
yourself some asphetitive. Do you know what it 
is? Asasoetida, I 
think 
it 
is. That's nearly right. Now those 
GH: Where do you get it? 
XX: Where do you get it? 
BL: At the drugstore, and we can't buy 
it anymore out here. 
Awful, I know where you have the 
lure for the animals and one 
thing and another, they have 
it. But I don't know whether they 
have the chunk or not. Buy the chunk, and then I put a piece 
about that big, end of your finger, cut a hole in a eel — salted 
eel 
is your best bait — but I put that in there, and that — put 
the scum(?) — I don't mind the smell, some people don't like 
it. 
So anyhow, I don't care how far it 
is, 
the snapper's gonna have 
it, 
he's coming at 
it. Now what you do 
GH: 
Is that like a fox lure? 
BL: Yeah, so you see where this wind is — if 
you put that funnel, 
that fyke you have there — you'd never catch anything, because 
they'd come up here 
in 
the tail end. So you put the tail end 
there. If the tide runs this way, or 
if the wind blows this way, 
that blows that way, and they come up to 
it this way — they'll 
never go around and go 
in. They'll come up against and they'll 
fight and everything else to get 
in 
there — they won't go 
in this 
end. You have the mouth so's 
if the smell goes that way, they 
come this way. 
If 
the tide's runnin that way, they come this way. 
I always set 
it for ebb tide. Everybody says flood tide. You know 
what happens? You see, 
if 
you set it for flood tide, you go to 
work and 
it fills up with muck. On the flood tide. And then when 
ebb tide comes, 
it makes the funnel open and everything like — if 
you set 
it for ebb tide, the way 
it 
is — you got to know how to 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 269 
do this you know, and experiment with 
t. I generally work 
in 
eddies, even though you got tide one way, when you get the eddies 
you got tide the other way, see. Anyway, I always set 
it for ebb 
tide. And then they go to work, and they come up, 
on the flood 
tide, to there — soon as ebb tide makes, they come around you 
know, the other way, and then you catch your snappers see. My dad 
always left the top 
line 
in the funnel 
loose. But I learned 
better, because he wanted to catch them 20, 30 pound snappers. 
And 
if you put it tight, sometimes when you get them big ones, 
you know. So I put it tight, and they'll force their way in, 
but 
they can't never get out because it's so tight where they are, 
you know 
GH: So 
if you 
left 
it 
loose, you might lose some of them? 
BL: But 
if 
you 
leave 
it 
loose. there's different things happens. 
For instance, 
it just turns on 
its side and that'll gap open. 
See, once their started and get their shell through, they're 
gone. But where you have 
it tight, they'll force their way 
in, 
you know, but when they start out — these two shells and their 
head fetches up, then they have to back out. Oh snappers — I've 
caught thousands and thousands of em. Well, 1 guess hundreds of 
tons, anyway. And when I was a little boy, seven years old, I had 
my brother was two years younger — even up when we was ten and 
twelve years old, he'd go with me. My dad would ship the snappers 
- we always got four cents a pound, that's what they sold for. 
They'd clear us about a penny a pound or a penny and a half, see, 
two at the most, because you had the freight and you had the 
commission, like that. And then if 
it cost you anything — course 
we always had the barrels and boxes and them things, plenty of 
them, didn't cost a thing. Anyhow, I'd catch a hundred pound a 
week and I'd get me a dollar or two you know. And then my 
brother, he was — I don't know how he hardly had 
it figured. He 
wasn't no dummy, but he wouldn't work. One day I had two 
bagfulls, snappers. Well I had about three of the big ones 
in one 
bag, and him two or three of the smaller ones. But he wasn't as 
old, maybe two or three years younger than me, made a difference. 
So I took the big bag, gave him the little one, we came out to 
the corn field, right down where our trailer is, 
there's a big 
corn field on that bench, houses there now. And so, we always 
come out at the big walnut tree there and we always sat down and 
rest there, nice and cool, you know. And we go out there and 
start to sit down — no snappers. I'm not gonna drag them 
snappers, he said — so I went back and got his bag, and I took my 
bag and his bag home — he wouldn't take one of em. But I had to 
give him half. 
XX: What was 
it 
like when you — were you nervous when you first 
started picking up snapping turtles? 
BL: No — I was never nervous 
in my 
life. 
GH: Snappers don't scare you. 
BL: Well I got ( ) from up above here. 
It was out 
in 
the park, 
out back here. Ten seconds, I hit the ground, busted that 
knuckle. See the difference? I busted my hand. In ten seconds — I 
had to fight four hounds with a busted hand. (unintelligible) But 
it didn't phase me a bit. They said, well you oughta quit. I 
said, quit, heck. But I lost a fight down at Wildwood — sporting 
man, you know how I done it? I was afraid to hit hard, you know, 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 270 
but gosh, I hit the guy I know five times, and every time he hit 
me, but he was 
XX: You were a professional fighter? 
BL: No, amateur. I never went professional. They didn't get that 
much money. 
XX: This was boxing? 
BL: Yeah. Oh man, I fought and fought - I was so good natured. 
Always laughed. You know what my name was 
in the papers - Smiling 
Billy Lee. Said he hit the guy with everything but the ring 
post 
- we had all 
them write-ups, one thing and another, I'd just love 
for you to see em. Young, you know. When I was a little fellow, 
got me some boxing gloves, and I just loved 
it. 
I wouldn't hit 
the guy. Man, 
I'd box you know, and I'd hit him easy, but I never 
hit nobody hard. I'd 
laugh - I just loved to do 
it, see. But I 
hit that guy hard, and he went down, and do you know, he got back 
up. I had to use my left hand - he didn't know it, 
I guess 
it 
scared him, and he kept runnin all 
the time. We didn't get no 
money much. We got a nice watch, something like that, you know. 
GH: Where were these matches? 
BL: One was out here to the park, over there, just two or three 
stones' throws. ( )marina. down here, Buck Street, that big 
building there - they got some kind of factory in there now. And 
then Wildwood Sporting Arena(?). You know, up to Vining on Landis 
Avenue, on the right there. We went there one night - that wasn't 
when I was fighting, but a promoter and different ones was there, 
and we could get in for nothin, see. Now, when we went up there, 
we had to pay. So I got two tickets for my wife and I, 
ringside, 
right up 
like that. So we went and got our supper - in them days 
it wasn't dinner, 
it was supper. Come back, and the tickets was 
gone. So I got the promoter of the fights and I told him, so I 
went to work. You go get two tickets, he said. So that's what I 
done. So we went to work, and later 
in the night, they got the 
guy when he brought his tickets in, 
and I got my tickets back. 
Didn't cost me anything extra, the way 
it was. But up at Vining, 
they was really gyps up there. 
GH: Could you tell 
us something about how you cook and eat the 
snappers? 
BL: Well, one of the principal ways that I like, 
is 
to take and 
slice 'em like this. Their legs, you know, and dip 
'em 
in beat-up 
egg, 
little cracker dust, and fry em. 
XX: Eggs and crackers? 
BL: Yeah, you know how you beat up eggs and put 
GH: 
It's 
like breaded veal, right? 
BL: That's what I was gonna say. You take a cutlet, breaded veal 
cutlet you know, that's what they do. They put it 
in egg, you 
know, beat up egg and then throw it 
in cracker dust, you know. 
XX: What would you season 
it with? Do you put seasoning 
in 
it? 
BL: Oh yes, sure. Mostly salt and pepper. Then you turn around 
and - some part, I forget which, you make like, pot pie. You 
can't tell 
it from pot pie. 
GH: That's the part that tastes like chicken? 
BL: Yeah. 
GH: What do the legs taste like? 
BL: Why they're a wonderful taste. You can't get anything tastes 
any better. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 271 
GH: They taste like snapper legs. 
BL: Well, a snapper doesn't have anything that tastes like 
snapper, as far as that goes. You wouldn't think it — you'd think 
you was eating black(?) veal 
or something like that you know. 
In 
their back, something like that, 
in 
the back shell, they got 
little holes, and that — oh, 
the most tender meat there ever- was. 
You take like a spoon, a scoop, and you scoop that out, 
like 
that. And I forget what they do with that, but my mother, she was 
a wonderful cook and she could fix everything. But the principal 
thing that I like 
is, I tell 
you, frying em. The 
legs, around like 
that. Solid meat. 
GH: Do you ever- eat the eggs? 
BL: Everybody just loved the eggs, and I never ate one 
in my 
life. Nope, I never ate one 
in 
my 
life. Lots of people would get 
em, 
and give somebody else the snapper, just eat the eggs. 
GH: What about the part 
in the back there, under the shell, 
is 
that 
BL: That's the part I'm talking about 
GH: Do you have a special spoon that you use just for that? 
BL: Oh, yeah. Anyone that cleans em, they have a special spoon to 
dip that out. But, when you clean em, yourself, you save that 
back and put all your meat in 
it, 
but you don't dip that out. The 
people that make snapper soup or something do that, see. 
MH: Do you have one of those special spoons? 
BL: No, 
no — I never cleaned one 
in my 
life. My dad's been dead 
1928, my dad died. That's how long he's been dead. 
GH: He used to do 
it? Clean the snappers? 
BL: Oh, yeah, when we'd get a snapper he'd clean 
it, 
until I went 
to testing it myself. And here's something else interesting — when 
I was thirteen years old 
in February, I got out of this grammar 
school — eighth grade, you know, 
in May. But anyhow, I trapped 
that winter, and muskrat season went out the first day of April. 
I saved my muskrats, and I had a hundred and twenty dollars 
worth, see. So 1 go to work — and my sister is ten years older 
than me. She took that 120 dollars, went to the post office, got 
a money order — I told her what I wanted, Sears and Roebucks 
catalog, so she sent for some net, see, sent this money order. 
And when 
it come, 
it was a box — oh, I don't know, big as that, 
right around it. Parcel post you know. And honest to goodness, 
that net must a been a half mile long. Our folks just had a 
little piece of net like that one there, ten fathom or something, 
and they'd catch them something to eat. But my gosh, we got that 
net, and we had weakfish by the hundreds. We had a little Sears 
and Roebucks putt—putt motor, we had a two and a half, not a 
four, horse — it'd go putt putt putt. We'd go up 
in the marsh, 
seven or eight mile up there, an hour up and a hour back, took 
them fish up there every day, and we'd have a buck a four(?) row 
out of em. Weakfish. Dan Newcomb bought a fish, you know — that's 
when I was a kid, thirteen, fourteen year old — and it started us 
in fishing. 
GH: Now you do a lot of trapping still? In the winter? 
BL: Yeah. I went to working last winter. Tom Brown was saying, 
Freddie, he sprayed so much — he didn't kill 
the old muskrats, 
but the young ones. Right little things, you know, they come out 
and they nibble all 
around 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 272 
GH: So Freddie's the game department here? 
BL: He's the one that has charge of the whole thing. Awful nice 
guy, do anything in the world for you, but still he's miserable 
in what he's doing, see. He's working backwards. 
GH: He's using that to get rid of the cattails and the foxtail 
grass? 
BL: They final) 
That helicopter 
He got into the 
the mosquito co 
didn't take you 
I don't think, 
back of Fredd i 
e 
fill, gravel 
an 
see. Got a big 
pickup like thi

y used this weed killer and killed all 
the grass. 
they're getting a bia 
lot of money out of that. 
mosquito commission — so, between the two of em, 
mmission and him, they've got a big place. Tom 
down there — he's not acquainted below the river 
in back of the barracks in Petersburg. Right in 
's barracks they've put thousands of loads(?) of 
d stuff. Helicopter comes and drops down there, 
truck, big stake truck, and then they've got a 
s. 
The stake truck don't carry quite enough, so 
a thousand pound on — on this pickup, see. Bring 
em both there, and five or six or seven men, they run with bags 
on their shoulder, 
like a line — load that helicopter up, and 
then day after day after snappers. Away she'd go, that 
helicopter, sometimes thirty minutes she'd be back, sometimes 
it'd take an hour. And boy, 
I'm here to tell 
you, just tons and 
tons and tons of 
it — that's supposed to, that spray, 
it killed 
everything. Every cricket, every grasshopper, even the birds was 
gone. 
MH: Didn't they have any meetings about that, 
local people could 
object? 
BL: They had meetings, yes. I never went to one of em. I always 
get mad. That's the way 
it 
is and 
like that — and I know what's 
happening, see. They sprayed our meadow and killed our muskrats, 
year after year. I'll 
tell you what I did do. 
GH: That was to kill mosquitos, or to kill 
the grass? 
BL: They don't want to kill anything — they want to get rid of 
that spray. Yeah, that's right. So anyway, this neighbor of mine 
down there, he was 
in the mosquito commission, and going around 
and getting people — they wanted to dig ditches, they wanted to 
dig one across my property. And my daughter had to sign and I had 
to 
.sign, 
you know. His name was Jess Work, he just died a short 
time ago. Ten year older than me. So I go to work and I — Now 
look, Jess, I don't care, 
I'll 
sign for that but you tell 
them if 
they spray that meadow — they'd go over 
it and spray with a white 
plane and come up over the trees, where our house was, and go up 
somewhere towards the state prison farm(?) and load up again and 
sprayed our meadow, see — I said, Look, you tell 
them I got four 
buckshot shells, for a twelve guage gun, down there in a jar at 
the bird pond. Everybody knowed where the bird pond was, see, 
that cove come up 
in there, alongside of the Moore's Beach Road 
clear up on that side goin down. Owned the whole thing, see — 
there, one piece we just sold for 120 acres to the gun club 
in 
Wilmington. Within the last year we sold that. Anyhow, he says, I 
don't blame you a bit. I said, You tell 
em, 
I'm goin to try to 
kill 
that pilot, when he comes up there. I told him. He said, I 
don't blame you a bit. So he musta told em, cause they didn't 
spray no more. Not there then, you know. But they'd already done 
the damage. Man, that was awful. Then when they dug that ditch, 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 273 
you know what they done? They went to work — and the ditch, 
it 
wasn't a line, but 
it was a .straight ditch. They come down, and 
went out where our big field was, out that way, then went back 
out where 
it was nice digging, where they had this here — I don't 
know what you call 
it, what the mosquito commission used to dig 
ditches, you know — and there it 
is. There, my god — and I told 
these people, well 
I'll 
let you know. That's not the 
line, 
the 
line's way over the other way. Yeah, we sold 120 acres — the 
whole thing was a mile long, see. Every tree that's on the other 
side of that road's on us. All 
the way on up. We sold 20 acres to 
my wife's niece — nephew — and of course mine by marriage, as far 
as that goes. And we sold the house trailer and a half acre there 
along the road. We sold that, and we still got about fifty acres 
left there. Where our trailer is, 
you know. Man, that was some 
piece of property. The greatest piece in this part of 
the 
country. Had a nice duck pond. Now they've let that salt come in 
there, I don't know what they're going to do. You know, 
let 
it 
ruin 
it. 
GH: So Ezra Cox has got property nearby? 
BL: He owns everything along the road, all 
the way down, next to 
us, 
see. Clear to Moore's Beach and all 
the way down West Crik, 
Ezra owns. And they've ruined all 
his meadow, millions and 
millions of dollars worth of 
it. They've killed more'n one 
million trees on us. Just figure — figure a dollar apiece, 
there's a million dollars. Trees, course, that's the little ones 
and all, you know — just thousands and thousands. 
GH: That was last winter when the tides busted through? Or this 
spring? 
BL: Well, 
it's been three year now. Yeah, you go there and 
look 
GH: That's when they were trying to build a dike along there and 
screwed it up? 
BL: Yeah, well that was the bay — that was right out at the bay 
front. That's where they dug the beach away. And that's a shame 
that was the nicest sand beach. I was standing there yesterday 
GH: 
It's right down there where that trailer is? 
BL: Yeah. Look just down below there, and it 
looks to me as 
if 
it's half high water, as 
if 
that sand 
is 
that high out 
in the bay 
there. Hundreds of thousands of tons of our beach out 
in the bay, 
where they dug 
it down and it washed out there. Shame. 
GH: 
I've got just one question more before we run out of tape. 
Could you tell 
me something about the birds that you see out 
there? What kind of birds come to those fields, and what they eat 
and what your names for them are? 
BL: Yeah. 
If 
it had been yesterday, I coulda showed you something 
you wouldn't believe. The crabs eggs, you know they're right 
little things 
GH: These are the king crab, or the horsehoe crab? 
BL: Horseshoe crab. They washed up on the windrow, on the beach, 
you could scoop — a few handfulls and you fill a tub 
in a little 
place. But this wind last night has washed it all 
away. I looked 
today, I thought it was a shame that you couldn't have seen 
it. 
But 
if you want — now these birds, we have different kinds. We 
have the black breast and the robin breast, 
in the spring, I 
don't know where they go but they go somewhere the other end, but 
they come here, 
in here on back — why, just thousands of 
'em and 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 274 
feedin on them eggs. Most of them that's down there now are what 
we always called the Bumblebee beach bird. 
GH: Bumblebee beach bird? 
BL: Yeah, they're right little - oh are they good eating - you 
take fifty or seventy five of them and they make a wonderful pot 
pie, see. 
GH: How do you catch em? 
BL: Well, you - we used to shoot once and kill a hundred, one 
shot. And we never kill 
any but what we could use. My dad wanted 
a pot pie or roast duck 
GH: So you've got the robin-breasts 
BL: And the black breast. 
GH: They live on the sand down there? 
BL: Oh, 
they don't live around here. 
GH: 
.Just pass through? 
BL: Yeah - course them there beach birds, they s.tay around pretty 
much all 
s.ummer. But look, when you went down the Moore's Beach, 
didn't you see that bird with the stripe on their wing? White? We 
call 
'em calicos. 
GH: They're about this tall, with a long beak? 
BL: No - no, the one with the 
long beak, they're the 
ibis I 
think. But these are light colored, they got nests all 
along that 
road. And they howl 
GH: Do they make a lot of noise? 
BL: Oh yeah, that's right. Well anyhow, we call 
'em calicos. And 
one of the big guys, he said, he believes that was the right name 
for 
'em - he couldn't think, you know - but we always call 
em 
calicos. Turn of the century, they was about gone. When I was 
about seven or eight years old, they commenced to come back. And 
they've got thicker ever since. But they don't seem to go 
in 
flocks. They seem to be 
individuals, you know, and up and down 
all 
the streams, criks and rivers everywhere. There's lots of 
them. And then your white birds - the egrets - on back we had two 
or 
three hundred of 
'em there, and something happened to em. I 
imagine they went to have their young where they have their nests 
- I don't think they have their nests around here, you know. 
They're the big tall ones, like the blue herons only they're 
white. We didn't never call 
'em egrets, we called 'em white herons 
GH: What about the 
little ones? 
BL: And the little ones, now they're - we always call 
'em white 
pokes. We had the blue poke, always had the blue poke, but they 
was never very thick. And then we had the night heron, the 
squawks. They holler squawk, you know, 
like that. You call 
'em up 
to you, just between sunset and dark, you know. But here's 
something else I'd 
like to tell you. You know the great horned 
owl? They're one of the most destructive things we got. People 
don't know it, 
they give 
'em protection - my gosh, the sight. They 
go down there at night, plenty of 
'em here, and they go along 
about this high, and here's these white herons. I believe that 
every one of them, and there must be fifteen or twenty down 
Moore's Beach Road, down on the left especially, - uh, comes down 
there nights, especially 
in 
the night, and they'll have one of 
them white herons. And 
if 
they stayed there, they'd thin 'em out, 
ten or fifteen every night. I don't think they ever go back and 
eat that one. They take 
it, 
up the shore somewhere there, and eat

his title 
is. He's down the totem pole, but he's the man, he's 
the person behind the desk. He's the permanent staff member who's 
behind the desk down there. So he'd be

the paperwork.

JS: Well, yeah. 
GH: 
Is that a brown thrasher? 
JS: Brown thrasher. They're legal 
on the roads, but see what 
they're doing to the roads. Now the way to stop this 
is 
to - you 
 
 right ban. I mean, there are too many people with 
legitimate reasons for four wheel drive, 
like me - I'm a 
botanist, I have to get back 
in here, now I have to use four 
wheel drive. Cause you can't spend the money repairing these 
roads now, 
it's not economical. The other thing to do 
is give 
every four wheel drive person a permit, to drive that vehicle. 
OK, 
if 
the state sold permits for four wheel drive vehicles that

come 
nto Wharton Park, and had the power to revoke the permit, 
that would stop this. And 
if 
you want to have a medium hard(?), 
you have to have a permit and the person has to have a valid 
reason. Such as a canoer, botanist, hunter, somebody who has got 
valid reason to use 
it. 
But if somebody comes on up and says, 
well 
I'd just like to drive my four wheel drive vehicle around, 
that's the sort of thing you say no to. Like you said, 
in 
Washington they set aside areas. They could do that down here in 
the 
pines — you've got a hundred twenty thousand acres. 
GH: Find someplace that's been sand mined. 
JS: Oh, even a patch of woods like this with just roads — they 
could make a road through this. I mean, 
if I had to, I could 
drive right through here. The understory isn't much, 
it's mainly 
blueberry, just drive around the big trees, mow the rest down. Or 
if 
you want to set up an area for them real 
quick, you set a 
controlled burn. 
GH: So when they're squirreling around 
in a bog, what particular 
regulation are they actually violating? Anything? 
JS: At the moment — probably wetlands destruction. They're 
probably violating a law. Wetlands are protected. 
GH: That's a state law? 
JS: State I believe, 
in this case. Now here we go — see, suddenly 
it, 
when the habitat suddenly changes, you know 
GH: Are these little patches of what looks like grass that Carex 
rigidica? 
JS: Yeah. There's also some grasses 
GH: Pennsylvanica I mean 
JS: And your catalpa. So you know we're 
in a tell(?) 
GH: I keyed out one grass, I was so proud of myself, Danfonia 
sericia. Growin out along 
JS: Sericia? or — you better make sure 
it's sericia. 
GH: 
I'm pretty sure 
JS: We have something called epilus. There's the old furnaces and 
the fence, now. That's Martha Furnace. And you can see the black 
soil, that's all 
the tailings. And this big pit right behind us 
was the furnace manager's house. 
GH: So how long ago was this furnace in operation? Same time as 
Batstow? 
JS: No, this preceded Batstow, this was one of the early 
furnaces. I'm thinking 1743 
it started filling(?), and I think 
was dead early. 
JS: This pond once had a real 
high bank as part of the...it had 
all 
these porcupine (unintelligible) The object of this was to 
study the distribution, where you could safely put 
in a log and 
actually build a lake up. 
GH: Luke O'Brien? 
JS: Leugobryan. That's the name — there's another one, 
little 
cushion shape. 
GH: People call 
it 
lump moss I guess. And this is cladonia. 
JS: Mmhm. All 
this mountain laurel 
(unintelligible) I don't know 
if 
it was intentionally brought in here when there was a village 
here, or not. This 
is the furnace. They used to mine ore way at 
the north end. They may have brought the ore down along here — 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 280 
and the road 
is still here. Isn't that nice cedar? Last year 
honeybees — pine barrens tree frog 
GH: 
Is that it? I've heard that. That's what I heard at Olsen's 
Bog. No chance at all 
of seeing one, eh? 
JS: Good chance. Here's Martha Bog. This 
is the classic pine 
barrens bog. 
GH: Pitcher plant, cranberries,... 
JS: We're on the old 
lake bed, and this lake has been drained for 
a long time, so 
it's part of the immigration effect. There's been 
a long time for species to find their way in, 
so this has a great 
diversity of species. And the other thing that's remarkable about 
it 
is 
its size. 
It starts down at the Martha furnace and 
it runs 
up, 
before 
it tapers off, about a mile and a half north of here. 
Here — spaghnum ground cover 
and then this brassy sort of thing, 
red 
leaf sundew, masses of 
it. Yellow flower is bog aspodel, 
Artesium ( ), 
and the stand you're gonna see here at Martha Bog 
is most of the population 
in the world — in one bog. ( )your 
scattered cranberry 
GH: Pitcher plant 
JS: Pitcher plant. Too early to tell about things like yellow 
eye(?) grasses, but there's rose begonia orchid and Calipogi, 
right together. And just starting to come up right now — here's 
last year's stalk, and here's this year's — for gold cress, 
Lopiol (?) americana. If you want to take that as a pure species, 
then you're, at the pine barrens you're at the last refuge. Some 
people lump 
it with a species that also occurs in Nova Scotia. So 
either you've got a species occurring in Nova Scotia and New 
Jersey currently, formerly New Jersey and Delaware, or you've got 
a species which occurs now just in New Jersey. 
GH: Oh there's one of the gold cress in bloom. 
JS: Yeah, (unintelligible) 
GH: And then 
is 
this club moss Carolinium? 
JS: No, this 
is Alopecaroides. Carolinianum is flat, short 
segments, right flat on the ground. This 
is much too wet for 
that, 
it grows on barren ground like Scythia. 
GH: There's a round leaf sundew. 
JS: Round leaf sundew, 
it's all over the place, and here's 
spatulate leaf sundew. All co—occurring. Yeah, there's the gold 
cress, 
it's got a single flower out 
in bloom, usually never more 
than three at a time. Even though the head has maybe twenty. Now 
that one you saw in bloom this morning closed, it's done. 
JS: Now into October, 
if you come to visit, the most different 
things will be coming into bloom. This next section is guaranteed 
muck, OK, but this habitat we're going across here, with this 
algae 
GH: Pine barrens tree frog. Catbird. 
JS: This mucky patch, with the algae, this gets hot during the 
season — you come on out here and 
it feels like you've gone into 
water that's been heated. And there are several bladderworts that 
live just in 
this one patch here. This 
is where the reverse 
bladderworts grow. 
GH: Now these sundews haven't bloomed yet? 
JS: No, they're just getting ready. 
GH: They have a pretty fancy ---
Nunn--B4 Audiocassette logs 
page 281 
JS: Red leaf has a big pink; flower, the other two have small 
white ones. 
JS: Utricularia cornuta, the horn bladderwort. 
GH: That's from the shape of that spoor on the flower? 
JS: Yeah. And 
it looks 
like a - it's a helmet shape, sort of 
like 
a conquistador's helmet. 
GH: There's a couple more gold cress, or are all 
of those gold 
cress? 
JS: Yeah, they're just beginning. 
GH: Especially with this weather, 
it really makes this place look 
like Alaska - black spruce would replace the white cedar. 
JS: Here's the Carolina club moss. See 
it's just very short 
segments, very flat. 
GH: What's this round leaf - oh that ( ) 
JS: Nymphaea, that's the sweet scented water lily. Here's s.ome 
leaves from gold club. 
GH: That's not out 
JS: That's done. That begins 
in 
late March. 
GH: Here's one with two flowers. 
JS: OK. 
JS: 
...spring. Now you see this, this like typically floods 
in 
the spring, the spring rains. 
GH: Sounds of bog 
JS: Bog trotting is 
the term that the botanists use down here. 
JS: 
...last year's capsule, and you can imagine what this looks 
like with the capsule on 
it. Doesn't that - if you get rid of 
that extra leaf right there, 
it'd look just like adder's tongue 
fern, Opia glossoidia. 
JS: 
...bog. This is the archtypicai bog. 
GH: So 
is 
it the same as a spung, or 
is the spung a kind of bog? 
JS: No, a spung can't have any flowing water in 
it. This does, 
this has a main creek running through it. And even this little 
patch here, this you see 
is sort of barren, this actually does 
flow. 
It flows that way. 
GH: Couldn't tell 
it 
by me. How would you find a pine barrens 
tree frog 
if 
you were 
JS: 
( )gravel. 
GH: 
Oh yeah. Oh - frog just jumped right in front of me. 
JS: Decomposing material - methane gas forming the ( ) bubble up. 
You can feel 
the very firm bottom under here, too. 
GH: 
Is that - has this been scraped for bog 
iron or something 
like that? 
JS: I doubt it, 
but this 
is the appropriate area for 
it to grow. 
Oh there's a fibrous bladderwort, Tricularia fibrousus. I know 
the flower - all 
the books tell you to use the leaves. 
GH: This doesn't have the helmet shape. 
JS: No, this has a very open pallet. 
GH: Birds might be down 
in here. Anything in particular? 
JS: 
Oh, you'd find different things - you find the swamp sparrows 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 282 
nesting on these shrubs(?). But that's about the only 
— along 
the edges, yellow throats. 
GH: So here's the spurred bladderwort there again? 
JS: Yeah, tornuda. Horned. 
GH: Here's another one that — nah, I don't think it's horned. 
)now that's an obscure looking guy 
:IS: 
I believe it's a canula(?) 
GH: 
...every inch of this bog? 
JS: Oh, I wouldn't say every inch, but I bet you somebody has. 
This 
is probably the most explored bog 
in the state. There are 
little things like last year I came 
in 
and I counted 13 false 
aspodel, tofieldia. And I think I got the entire population for 
this whole section of the bog. 
GH: When does that flower? 
JS: Mid July. 
GH: Yeah, here's a tofieldia. 
GH: So what's this guy here? 
JS: Look here's a begonia with two flowers. Those little guys 
coming up — I wonder what the change is that's caused them to be 
short this year and tall 
in years past. This sedge 
is all 
gone — 
this 
is 
one of the sedges you find particularly in the Jersey 
bog, Carex exilis. And that's the early bloomer. Yeah, a single 
spike, and the pistilate flowers are all 
at the top and the 
stamenate flowers are all 
at the bottom. Keys out 
in a snap. 
GH: Kinda like, was 
it Pennsylvanicus, what was that other one? 
JS: Wall, Pennsylvana has several flowers, has separate stamenate 
and pistolate. So this 
is 
in group one of the careces 
in which 
you have stamenate and pistolate all on the same spike. Here's a 
habenarial(?) weed — this'll probably be, at the very broadest, 
white fringed. 
JS: Now the last item you need 
is a little barren patch of ground 
for 
it to grow on. 
GH: So curly grass would be with the Carolinian club moss? 
JS: The tiny cedars and the round leaf sundew. No, not this one. 
JS: 
...spring fed, by springs popping out of the bank there. 
Comes down to this level, trickles its way down there. 
GH: 
....willows 
JS: Yeah, there's the main branch of the, the Oswego branch of 
the ( ). 
And you see we're actually sitting — see right now 
you've got these pools of water and such and this sluggish stream 
and we're what — a foot and a half above 
it`≥ And then look at 
this dark ground — remember how dark that water is, that really 
absorbs the sunlight. So 
it gets hot, and 
it makes a 
microenvironment right 
in 
that section of the bog, different from 
every other section of the bog. Even in this bog you've got this 
huge mosaic going on. Here's a sort of an oxbow channel, with 
sluggish water. And here's a medium flowing channel. And then the 
main channel. Here's a gravel bar, and there are mud banks — 
there's a whole patchwork of environments going out here. 
GH: What is that sedge growing 
in 
the flowing water right there? 
JS: That is cerpus(?) — that is a junkus(?) I believe. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 283 
GH: 
It g ust has a terminal cluster. 
JS: Yeah. 
GH: Big one 
JS: Yeah. I believe it's a junkus — I don't want to claim which 
one, but it might be Caesari ens, which 
is pretty unusual. One of 
the arrowheads, sagitaria teres. Sounds like 
it grows on land? 
No, this one the teres part means quill—like. And the 
leaves are 
quill—like, the philopodea, and they're all 
on the bottom, and 
it 
only blooms during dry years. 
GH: So you never see 
it? 
:1S: 
You never see 
it, 
in a normal year you don't see the species, 
unless you go along and then you have to be able to recognize the 
leaves. 
GH: 
...get across it? Waded it? 
JS: Depending upon where you find your spot, anything from three 
and a half or four feet to six inches. 
GH: So it's not that deep. 
JS: Yeah. I would not try crossing right here 
in 
the bend. 
GH: Hey there a kingfish 
JS: A flicker. You don't try crossing 
in a bend, cause 
in a bend 
you have a velocity change and that generally scours. That's why 
the gravel's up here, sort of a point bar situation, migrating 
point bar. 
GH: What's the plant that's growing kind of knee—deep in the 
water right at this poit, between us and the main channel? 
JS: There's some dulichium, three—way sedge, down here. 
GH: Now these flies here that have the patterned wings? Do you 
happen to know the Latin name of that? These little biters. 
JS: Oh the 
little brown — no I don't. They're just called deer 
flies. 
GH: Pine flies are another term I've heard. They're presumably 
related to the greenheaded flies of the swamp marsh. 
JS: Oh no, 
they just bite — they 
bite like that and they're slow 
fliers, so 
if 
they bite you you can get even with them. Just like 
a house fly. And flies just as fast but t ? have the reflexes as 
fast. You can't swat. 
it. 
GH: And 
is 
it a black fly, 
in the black fly group? 
JS: 
No, 
it's not a black fly, 
it's 
like a house fly. Bottlefly, 
is 
that that group? 
GH: Yeah. 
JS: Yeah. It's probably the same genus as housefly — that's how 
close 
it 
looks. 
JS: 
...gives you the same form, that Carex strict@. 
GH: And 
it grows in here too? 
JS: 
Uh, yeah you can find 
it 
in here — there are other areas 
where it's more — that's a widely distributed sedge, and that's 
the common tussock—forming sedge 
in wet areas. 
GH: Hurlygraphs, aha 
JS: There it 
is 
GH: And 
is 
that the fertile frond there? 
JS: There's the fertile frond just starting to come up, yeah. 
It;s not quite open yet. 
GH: How anybody ever discovered that — it looks quite a bit like 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 284 
a ( ) coming up. 
JS: Yeah, and I forget what they think now, but 
GH: 
Is this one of the first places they found it? 
JS: The bridge was the first place. Then they started finding it 
other spots. Galusatia devosa. Awifully good spot to 
look for it. 
Oh I know we'll find 
it up around the corner. 
GH: How about this? Yeah, that's Galusetia devosa. 
JS: No, that's leatherleaf. This 
is Cobadachne calicuta. And it's 
already gone well 
to seed. Galusatia devosa should be 
in flower 
about now, just like this one 
is 
right here. 
GH: There 
it 
is. 
It 
looks just like the one I saw ( ) 
JS: That's about — see this 
is never mowed so 
GH: This has stalked glands on 
it. 
JS: 
It does? 
GH: I think so, the one I looked at did. 
JS: Oh yeah, they certainly do 
look that way. one of the 
advantages of being near—sighted. 
GH: Yeah, grouseberry is 
the term, one that they use for that 
species 
in particular. 
JS: What's interesting 
is 
the books say that this grows 
in either 
peaty areas or dry soil. 
GH: Tree frog. Here we are standing amongst the curly grass fern 
and the pine barrens tree frog. Oh here's more devosa 
JS: And right next to — look, there's narthesium, 
lopheola, 
GH: Hey, there we go, there's the button one. 
JS: Yeah, the pipewort. 
GH: Which species 
is 
this? 
JS: Ariocolon, and this time of the year it's compressum. 
GH: So what are there — three species? 
JS: There are three species that grow in the bog here, and they 
all 
have different seasons. Decangulare and septangulare, and the 
way you do them later on 
is you count ridges on the sides. 
GH: Oh I see, that's what the ridges refer to. But compressum 
doesn't fit into that distinction. Look at this little guy down 
here, just starting to come up. 
JS: Yeah, that could be the next species 
GH: Will they grow to the same height? 
JS: This one I may have called too fast — it doesn't feel 
like 
compressum. You notice the stems? These stems are rigid, so this 
looks 
like decangulare, cause it's got at least ten ridges, 
rather than septangulare which only has seven. 
GH: And then this little guy here? 
JS: There's lots of variation 
in height. Height is 
not a very 
good character. 
JS: 
He teaches plumbing. He's not a trained botanist. He and his 
brother had a ( 
) and they learned the hard way, never had a 
formal course. Frank loved sedges, rushes and grasses. 
GH: That's the true botanist. 
JS: 
And he and his brother between them rediscovered species that 
had been lost for 80 years, 90 years. The type specimen of Rexia 
aristosa came from near Egg Harbor City, and 
it wasn't until 
the 
Hearsts rediscovered it 
in 1957 that they found the type location 
again — it's the only location 
in the state where 
it grows, 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 285 
disjunct from the Carol 
na.s 
and south. 
GH: Now is this a round leaf sundew here? 
JS: Yeah. Round leaf 
is 
the one you often find way up 
in the 
cedar bogs — and here in the same springy area is the 
leaf of 
Habidary clavilata, the green woodland. That's one of the few 
Habinarias down here that grows in 
the shade. 
It doesn't like the 
sun, 
it grows 
in the shade. Real 
common 
in the woods. And so 
Frank was out, and Frank was one of these people, he knows all 
the panic(?) grasses on sight — he doesn't need to carry the book 
anymore. And so he was down 
in Egg Harbor, 
in this really weird 
habitat, 
it's called a vernal pond. A vernal pond floods in the 
spring, but by the end of summer it's absolutely dry. And so 
that's where the Rexia was growing, that's where Utricularia 
olivasia grows — the only known location 
in 
the state. That was 
discovered by the Hearsts. The professional botanists almost 
erected a new genus for it, 
until someone discovered its true 
identity 
in one of the southern floras. Because the next location 
north 
is 
in Georgia. And so Frank was out there, 
in one of these 
real 
dry years, found this panic grass out there, and he didn't 
know what it was. Well 
it eventually turned out to be Panicum 
Hearstium — Hearst's panic grass. 
GH: That's the only place it grows? 
JS: No, since 
it was discovered and they knew what kind of 
habitat to 
look for, they found it 
in one spot in Georgia where 
the Utriculara olivasia grows. 
GH: 
Incredible. Yeah, I sometimes think botany's got more to 
offer than bird watching. 
JS: Here's one of these percolating springs. This 
is where I used 
to store my eggs. 
GH: 
Is this an old cedar fossil, sort of? 
JS: No, that's probably new. I remember this being a deeper hole. 
The people who used to camp back 
in here used to keep this clean, 
so 
it was sand bottom. And that way you had more room to store 
things. That's probably back to the fifties before colman chests 
and bags of 
ice were really common to carry. 
JS: 
...ready to switch on over to ( ) The old campsite's still 
got the ( ) Here's another one. 
GH: So this runs down the Bass River? 
JS: This 
is Wading. This 
is 
the Oswego branch of 
the Wading. 
That's what I smell — ( ). But you can see where the flow comes 
out over here, and 
it makes its own delta. And that delta will 
get washed away 
in 
the spring floods, 
it'll 
go on down stream. 
GH: 
...canoe 
in here? How far can you go? 
JS: Oh, 
you put the canoe 
in 
up at Oswego. Then(or?) you take it 
on down to Harrisville and then continue on. 
JS: Uh, pirola 
GH: Pirola — no 
it's not pirola — oh yes 
it 
is 
JS: Chemopila 
GH: Chimophlomaculata, how's that? 
JS: Spotted wintergreen, got stripes on the 
leaves. That's why 
it's called — I call 
it striped wintergreen. Long name. 
(unintelligible) 
GH: There's a pirola with a leaf just like that out west too. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 28b 
(tape 
lows down momentar ly - unintelligible) 
JS: 
...a real 
complex. So from between Calico and Martha, you 
have one sort of bed shelling out there, 
in which you have that 
spring fed and 
it's about a foot down to the hard substratum, and 
you get that horrible iron mud that you're going a foot deep -
you sort of glop your way through it. Now from Calico north here, 
you end up with a system of quaking mats, OK - it's much further 
down to the system. And that goes on up till 
you hit Buck's Run. 
GH: 
(makes frog noise) Doesn't sound quite like a tree frog. 
JS: No, 
it 
isn't. We'll have to get closer. But then you hit 
Buck's Run, and Buck's Run has 
its own old delta. 
GH: Bird. 
Is that a tohee baby? 
JS: No. 
It's a frog. I'm wondering if 
it's 
like the green tree 
f 
rog? 
GH: Don't ask me. 
JS: So 
if you get up 
to the Punsquan Delta, that - once again you 
hit sand areas, you know the old delta mouth, and where that 
intersects the main branch again, then 
you start getting these 
open, sandy patches with little shrubs and such on them. And so 
it's no spaghnum, OK, but barren sand and a little bit of mud 
from the run-off onto it. And that gives you a different sort of 
environment. 
GH: What's that song? 
JS: Black and white. One of the territorial birds. 
GH: Now what's this grass here? Looks different. (pause) Ok, we 
gotta get that on the record here - why do botanists wear hats 
in 
the pine barrens? 
JS: So when they fall on through a quaking spaghnum mat you can 
find the body. No, actua►ly, you fall once - a whole group of us 
had been out bog trotting, right near where the mill 
is. And we 
all 
came on out - you know, bog trotting, you see how we are now 
- muddy up to the knees and tired. And I guess there were about 
forty of us 
in 
the group. And this car stopped, and asked, what 
in 
the world were we doing? And Lou Hand, without a break 
in 
pace, with the straightest face you ever saw, said, well, we've 
only found one of the bodies so far. And that was a bit 
scattered. We should be able to find the others shortly. With 
that the car just took off down the road. One of the major 
reasons why Spots(?) don't like to give out plant locations down 
here 
is 
that the Jersey barrens have a long history of being 
raped by collectors. And the worst period was 
in 
the mid-fifties, 
when a gentleman by the name of Norcross, who owns the Norcross 
card company 
GH: That's that little 
JS: Yeah, the Utricularis subulata. Had professional botanist 
come down, they would come to a bog 
like this, and they'd put a 
stake 
in the ground next to each one of the plants that was of 
interest. Like 
it might be every single habinaria, 
in a bog. And 
then the following week, these field hands would come down, and 
they would dig up everything that was staked. They had truck 
loads - thousands and thousands of plants at a single time. And 
the biggest place that got hit was Sim Place. 
In other words -
this apparently was where somebody was giving a discussion, 
they're all 
trampled down. This will recover. 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 287 
GH: Now is 
th s decangulare too? 
JS: This hard stuff? That's what you do 
squeeze the stem. 
Compressum squeezes, cause it's sort of hollow in the middle. 
GH: So what happened with this guy's operation? What was he doing 
with all 
the plants - selling them? 
JS: No, 
he was trying to grow them in Connecticut, on his 
property. 
It was in Connecticut - I talked to somebody from 
Connecticut who claims that the Norcross property 
is 
really 
in 
Massachusetts. I don't know if 
he ever had success, but he did 
the same. thing with pine barrens gentian, and would come in -
Warren Grove was hit, and thousands of plants disappeared 
overnight. 
GH: The mentality 
JS: Everybody wants a specimen of this or that. To try to grow 
it. 
And so many of these things, you just don't know how they 
work. Look at the Narcissium out here. Now I learned something 
neat the other day because my friend who was working with orchids 
tried some of the seeds to see what would happen. He tried 
culturing them, and he discovered something. They need sunlight 
to grow. 
In other words, he threw them on a medium, with no 
sunlight - with no cover, 
like petunia seeds, 
like you start 
petunia seeds. And that's what they need to germinate. He said 
the slightest bit of cover, and the seeds would not germinate. 
GH: Well, 
I'm about ready to bag 
it. Bog 
it. 
JS: Yeah, so am I. 
It's just about seven o'clock. But this gives 
you an 
idea of the classic pine barren bog. And the season, 
like 
I said, has just begun. I think for(?) the weeds and things like 
this - bog aster, Aster nemoralis -
GH: Absorbed about as much as I can, at one stretch. I'm toying 
with the idea of trying to get some money for a more extended 
research project of my own, working with local people and plant 
and animal terms, classifications. 
If 
so, I may come back next 
summer - boy that's a big 
leaf. Vaccinium macro 
JS: Macrophilum(tape speeds up - unintelligible) 
JS: 
...quite distinctive one. 
GH: Yeah. Course I had no way of knowing that until I finally got 
a chance to sort em out for myself. And then the books really 
don't provide you with the, anything like the basis you need to 
tell 
em apart. Why are there no big pine trees in the pine 
barren? 
JS: Because the mosquitos pick them up and build nests with them. 
The other thing 
is 
like the spacing of the beams on my porch -
the four by fours are about six feet apart? That's actually the 
barrier - the wings of the mosquitos can't get in there, with 
their wings open. 
GH: The Jersey mosquito net. Three foot mesh. 
JS: Something like that, yeah 
JS: No, see you're driving up 
GH: You just don't see much of anything. 
JS: 
...through these pines here, and you see a little bit of 
sandwort, 
little bit of this, but now 
is when the bogs really 
JS: 
...1907 till his death, I think 
it was during the forties, 
I'm not certain of the date of his death. Maybe 
it was later - 
Hunn--8d Audiocassette logs 
page 288 
maybe 
it was eariy fifties when he finally passed away. Frank 
Hearst remembered him. And I don't know if he was a professional 
botanist or not, but he did silly things like find all 
these 
species that no one else ever saw before. Cardamini longii 
Long's bittergrass. Hypoxis longii, which is found only 
in 
southeastern Virginia. And a couple other Hypoxes, called 
stargrasses. 
GH: So where did he work up here 
in New Jersey? 
JS: He was based - I believe he was out of Philadelphia, was his 
main base. 
GH: Part of that crowd. 
JS: Yeah. There's a Serpus longii, which was discovered 
GH: Was he a contemporary of Stone and all 
that? 
JS: Yes. 
In fact Stone, 
in his book, talks about Long as being a 
young man - Mister Bayard Long. Not in terms of, say, a 
professional colleague. 
GH: Somebody who brought in weird things. 
JS: But somebody who was a superb amateur. Now I don't know if 
that's true or not, that's the impression I got. I've never read 
the biography of Long. What's interesting is that Stone himself 
was not a scientist. He was a librarian. Interested in natural 
history. Pure natural history. There just aren't people like that 
anymore. Well, they're out there, but you never find them coming 
out of colleges and universities. 
(end of side one) 
} 
JS:... and the way he got his job was, he walked up to the dean 
of the college and said, I'm gonna teach ornithology, I have my 
own specimens and don't need a salary. And so, that's how 
ornithology was taught at Princeton. But not only could - I 
remember going to a lecture at the Delaware Valley club. He gave 
a tal!•: 
on the pigeons of the world. And after about two hours of 
talking, he picl,.ed up one and he says, Now this 
is one I haven't 
seen 
in 
its native habitat - and he'd already gone through 
hundreds of species from all 
over the world. And another time he 
gave a quick. 
lecture - somebody asked the wrong question and he 
gave a, 
sort of a one hour lecture on the life history of the 
ants of New Jersey. Spur of the moment. And he was also a 
botanist, a lepidopterist, and one of these people who knew 
everything about the 
local flora and fauna. And it's something 
that's harder and harder to find nowadays. I belong to a lot of 
natural history clubs, and there are really very few young people 
nvolved. Seems to be - it's either one of these periodic 
traditions - every twenty years you find another group again that 
sort of all matured about the same time. 
GH: I know a few people who've heard about your type of zoo(?) 
--
moving in that direction. I don't know how far they've really 
managed to go with that. 
JS: Baltimore - or Maryland - Maryland just had a renaissance in 
ornithology. And it all 
began with one group, the beginner bird 
watchers, who are now pretty well known. Rick Long. I remember 
Rick, showing him his first red-breasted fly-catcher nine years 
ago. And here he 
is now co-author or one of the co-authors of the 
Geographic field guide. And Bob Wengler. I remember showing him a 
number of 
life(?) birds - and now he's known nationally. Richard 
Hunn--84 Audiocassette logs 
page 289 
Rolette, sort of a off--beat, sort of wandering around, going out 
on pelagic trips, and 
is now one of the world authorities on sea 
birds. Hal Wyringer is another one. 
GH: 
...Seattle now 
JS: Hal Wyringer was a civil engineer, he got fed up with 
it and 
retired. He's about 37, 38 years old. 
GH: I couldn't really tell, I figured he was somewhere about my 
age. I think that guy McCaskey's a civil engineer too. 
JS: But Hal decided he wasn't going to be a civil engineer 
anymore and he retired and became a bird watcher. And 
it was 
hocking — about four years ago Hal 
actually had to get a job, he 
was running low on funds. So he delivered newspapers. He finally 
got a better job because the county he was 
in wanted to 
learn 
more about seagulls. And so he was their official bird watcher in 
the county. Broke his heart. 
GH: So now he's a professional

seems to 
be about birdwatching people) 
GH: 
...one real 
rainy winter, 68 or something like that. It 
rained and rained all weekend, every weekend, from December on 
through March. (unintelligible) 
JS: I didn't learn bird—banding until I got to Maryland. And then 
( ) Woods, one of the local bird—handers, ran about three or four 
nets 
in her back yard. And got the bug — I became a fanatic. I 
was running thirty—some nets. One reason why I didn't finish my 
PhD thesis — I took up bird—banding. I learned a whole new branch 
of ornithology. 
(mostly unintelligible again) 
JS: I just found out one of our local birders down here — Howard 
Boyd, 
is 
an authority, probably the authority, on the New Jersey 
pine barrens tiger( ) 
GH: I kinda got into a lot of that odd stuff doing my 
dissertation. I figured I was gonna do the vertebrate species, 
the classification of vertebrates. The day before I was going to 
leave, I ran into an entomologist. He started talking — come on 
over to my office — loaded me up with killing bottles, and all 
that stuff. Bring em back, 
let me 
look at em. 
(unintelligible, seems to be about bugstudy) 
GH: Here we go — not too far to go.
