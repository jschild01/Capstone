JM: Okay.  We have those back.  Um, do you need any room tone? 
JB: No, we’re okay on that. 
JM: Okay.  Any other housekeeping? 
JB: No. 
JM: I think not, okay.  Um, we’re delighted today to be able to sit down with you, Ms. 
Duncan.  Um, uh, our interviewee is Ms. Gwendolyn Annette Perkins Duncan and we will talk 
about local civil rights history and her involvements, uh, that are ongoing still even today.  Um, 
thank you very much for your generous willingness to sit down and also your flexibility because 
I know we’ve had to juggle our day today.  So thank you for that. 
GD: You’re welcome.   
JM: Yeah. 
GD: Thank you. 
JM: Let me ask just to, and I think we’ll probably spend about a half an hour together, so 
we can kind of pace ourselves that way.  Um, I wonder if you could start by talking a little bit 
about your family and it’s, how, how it’s situated here, um, historically in, in St. Augustine and 
how you’ve, how you’ve all had your various involvements in, in the Movement and its legacy. 
GD: Okay.  I’ll start off.  My name is Gwendolyn Annette Duncan and, um, I was born 
and raised in Lincolnville of St. Augustine, Florida, June 28th, 1956.  I am a fifth generation 
native.  My great-grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, Thomas A. Findley, lived in St. 
Augustine and in Lincolnville.  I was told that he moved from the Carolinas.  It took many years 
for them to get here and I used to often wonder from a child why would they come so far to St. 
Augustine? What was the driving force to lead this family to come, Findley is a surname, to St. 
Augustine? And later in life, I learned why.  
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11

But my great-great-grandfather, he had thirteen children.  Some were born along the way 
coming to St. Augustine in South Carolina, Georgia, and eventually he ended up in, um, 
Moultrie, which is just south of St. Augustine, St. Johns County.  And I was told that and we did 
the research that he had about thirteen acres and was a farmer.  Now his daughter, which was my 
great-grandmother, Abbie Findley, she, she married a Hilman, Abbie Findley Hilman.  She 
bought some land in Lincolnville and the St. Augustine Record, which did not mention black 
people often, made mention of his eighty-ninth.  Uh, he died at eight, eighty-nine years of age 
and they said he served the white community well.  That was in the newspaper.  We all just like, 
we were, what he was, he brought his wares from Moultrie to St. Augustine, the city of, and 
eventually moved in Lincolnville with my great-grandmother.  She was a founder of St.  
Cyprian’s Episcopal Church, which has been in Lincolnville for maybe over a hundred and fifty 
years now.  My mother, my mother’s grandmother, Elizabeth, no, that was Abbie, she, um, lived 
right directly across from the church, which they built and it’s still, it has half a congregation 
right even to this day.   
Uh, it was fun growing up in Lincolnville.  Things were segregated, but you know, as a 
child, you really didn’t know what segregation was all about until you ventured off in the 
downtown areas.  But growing up in Lincolnville like I said, it was great.  There were many 
businesses along the way because of the segregation.  You know, you had your own grocery 
stores.  You had the beauty parlors.  There were bars along the street on Washington Street.  
There were, uh, had newspaper publishers.  Uh, you know, everything you needed was in 
Lincolnville and the church was a center of activity.  They had the church socials, picnics, 
everything centered [5:00] around the church.  And, uh, I am one of eight girls.  My mother had 
eight girls, no boys. 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11

JM: Eight girls. 
GD: And, uh, so I guess it was kind of, you know, the house was situated for women and 
young girls, not my, my stepfather, who, uh, was the only man in the house, but a hard-working 
man and I thank the Lord, you know, for my great-grandmother.  I knew her.  She died at 
probably about eighty-nine or ninety years of age as well.  She died before my grandmother, my 
mother’s mother, died, and she died in November of 1963, the same month that, uh, President 
[John F.] Kennedy was shot.  I can remember that happening.  But I know you want to talk about 
the Civil Rights Movement.  What I remember most from a child at seven and a half years old 
when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came to St. Augustine was the marches by the Ku Klux 
Klan.  From a child’s point of view, everybody dressed – 
JM: Through Lincolnville. 
GD: Through Lincolnville.  From a child’s point of view and you didn’t know what was 
happening, uh, you thought it was some big parade that you wanted to participate in.  You know, 
it was just, you know, it was a parade to me.  But I can recall, you know, at night, there was a 
time of terror and, um, I remember one night in particular, I guess all the black people came out.  
Uh, I was a little child, but I can remember, you know, black people lining the streets and the Ku 
Klux Klan marching through the area and we went down on the corner of DeHaven and Central 
Avenue, which is now Martin Luther King Avenue and I, and we watched the marches march 
through our area.  And I can remember as we were walking home, my mom holding my, one of 
my sister’s hands and mine and she said, “Don’t look back.” I can just remember the terror of, 
“Don’t look back.  Keep walking.”  
And, um, some of my classmates, you know, at Excelsior [Elementary School], some of 
their homes on the other street were bombed, fire bombed, but I can remember something sticks 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 5 of 18 
 
out in my mind about a bad cop and I used to think that Babcock Furniture store, they were bad 
people, but it was like this “bad cop” I would hear from a child’s point of view.  Bad cop, she 
didn’t trust the bad cop, you know? And, uh, I remember one morning, you know, my mom was 
on the porch.  She was combing hair and Dr. King must have, he was staying across the street to 
Mr. Proctor’s house and I don’t know if he stayed there that night.  All I know is he came across 
the street to ask my mom is she was going to participate in the rally or the marches that night.  
And that, and I used to always think it was like a faded memory.  I asked my mom when I got 
older, “Did that actually happen? Because I remember it happening.” You know? And she said it 
did.  You know, you know, you have these faded memories and then you have to verify.   
But um, as I grew older and I was about ten, eleven, twelve, when you had to venture off 
downtown, that was the only time I really experienced, uh, you know this segregation, going into 
a store and people watching you like you were going to take something or steal something.  And 
I can remember the, because everything was in walking distance.  Downtown was not far away.  
It was less than two miles, less than a mile.   
But I can remember the doctor’s building and Flagler Hospital was around the corner and 
the, the doctor’s building on Tremerton Street, I can remember a “colored” sign being up on the 
wall when you walked through the front door and as you, it was right to the right.  I mean, I can 
see that sign even now.  But the memory is I can also, you know, remember it coming down.  
But we would have to go to the right and go around to the back of the doctor’s office and there 
was a straight hallway when you walked through the door that you could not tread and I was 
always wondering what was down that hallway? You know, that’s the way I wanted to go, but 
the sign, the colored sign pointed to the way that I should go.   
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 6 of 18 
 
But I can remember that sign coming down and although they painted over where that 
sign was, the spot where it was was still, it was, you still could see the spot.  So when it came 
down, I thought, you know, and I took my sister, one of my younger sisters to the doctor because 
my mom would be working and my stepfather as well.  But I had to take her to the doctor’s 
office because although I was the second from the oldest, I, I was given a lot of responsibility, I 
guess, because I was, my mom always said, beyond my years.  And I remember I said, “Well, 
that sign is down.  I’m going to go straight down this hallway,” which was forbidden before.  
And I walked down there and my little sister and we entered in the doctor’s office and everybody 
looked at you as though you had a communicable disease, you know, when you walked through 
that door.  I can just remember that feeling.  But, um, and I went to the front, put my name down 
[10:00] for my sister as she needed to see the doctor and we sat down and to my surprise, they 
called us first and I thought, “Oh great.  We don’t have to wait that long.” But then they marched 
us back through that office back to the back side where we used to come in the back. 
JM: And if, if I followed your timing correct [clears throat], if, if you’re ten or twelve at 
the time – 
GD: Mmm hmm. 
JM: This is well past, of course, the passage of the Civil Rights Act.   
GD: Yes. 
JM: This is ’66, ’67, ’68. 
GD: Yes, yes, yes.  I couldn’t remember the exact year, but I do remember the sign when 
it came down and as I grew older, you know, you don’t understand from a child’s point of view 
what is happening all around you.  Yet I remember being in the fifth grade and I completed my 
fifth grade year at Excelsior Elementary School and in the sixth grade, we had to go, it was 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 7 of 18 
 
forced integration.  So our school closed down and we had to go to Orange Street School and I 
can recall the teachers not wanting to teach you, you know, it was, and the kids not wanting to sit 
by you.  But I felt good about myself because I was not, you know, I guess I, I had some good 
self-esteem and, um, and I was a smart, you know, no brag, just fact, you know, I was a smart 
child.  You know, I probably would have been valedictorian if the class, if, uh, the schools 
remained black, you know, or salutatorian of my class.   
But I can remember going, being forced to go to these schools and, and we had to fight, 
like it wasn’t non-violence.  We had to fight.  Even to eat, you know.  Uh, the teachers didn’t 
want to teach you and, uh, and you felt a sense of a second class citizen, which I never felt being 
in the area of Lincolnville when it was segregated, you know.  But, and I didn’t like that feeling 
and, uh, so I, even to, to my teen years going to the junior high school, uh, the junior high school 
didn’t even have a cafeteria.  So you had to walk back to Orange Street just to eat and the white 
kids would form a line, you know, to prevent you from going to eat your lunch, you know.  So it 
was, it was a lot of violence back then, I remember in the teens, you know, in the junior high and 
the high school.  It wasn’t non-violence, you know.  People were fighting, you know, just 
fighting just to, uh, like I said, just to eat lunch, you know, because you were not wanted and 
they made you feel that way.  You were not wanted at those schools. 
But the Lord blessed and we were able to get on and graduate even through St. Augustine 
High School, but you still felt that atmosphere of not being a part of the city in which you grew 
up in.  Uh, my kids experienced it, you know, and there is an atmosphere still here in this town.  
Uh, Mrs. Carrie Johnson refers to it as like, uh, uh, a hidden vapor, you know, over this town.   
But I thank the Lord for the Twines [Henry and Katherine Twine].  I thank the Lord for 
Dr. Hayling.  I learned about him later in, in life as I grew up and, uh, but there was an 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 8 of 18 
 
opportunity after one of my friends, Mrs. Katherine Twine, died.  She, she would tell us bits and 
pieces about the Civil Rights Movement and, uh, I felt that because I, I lived through it, you 
know, the signs being up and then them coming down.  But David Nolan [historian in St. 
Augustine with great expertise concerning the Movement], after her interment in 2002, he and J. 
T. Johnson from Atlanta, Georgia; Jean Billingslea-Brown, she was a professor at one of the 
schools, I think it was Spellman [College] in Atlanta; David Nolan, as I said; Mrs. Carrie 
Johnson; Dwight, uh, I think, I can’t remember his last, last name, Dwight Hines, I believe it 
was; Sandra Parks, they all met at a restaurant, South Seas, over on the island [Anastasia Island] 
and they discussed the upcoming fortieth anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement of St. 
Augustine.   
And David Nolan, who was a local historian, asked me to put on my thinking cap to 
come up with some ideas of how we could commemorate or celebrate this event.  And so when I 
got that email, I, uh, told my husband about it and he said, “We’ll help, you know, we’ll, we’ll 
do what we can.” So I emailed him back and I said, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do it.” I 
said, “We can base this celebration, this commemoration on a family reunion and invite all these 
people had participated in the Movement back to St. Augustine.” Because in 2001, we had a 
family, our first [15:00] Findley family reunion, in which we invited people from all around the 
country, you know, back to St. Augustine for a family reunion and David Nolan took part in that.  
And, uh, I just want to mention too that we found one of, my daughter did genealogy research 
and we found one of our cousins, who was the ambassador to Madagascar under President [Bill] 
Clinton’s administration.  We found her all the way over there in Africa, Madagascar, the island 
on the side [that is, of the African continent].  But it was such a wonderful time, a joyous time, 
until I thought that would be a great thing to invite these people back to hear their stories, their 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 9 of 18 
 
incredible stories of their participation because we, as we learned about the Civil Rights 
Movement, we know a lot of them left the city.   
So, Mrs. Carrie Johnson and I set up a meeting at the Galimore Center [named for St. 
Augustine native Willie Galimore, who played professional football with the Chicago Bears] 
and, uh, and we put it in the paper and invited people to come for a strategic meeting to see if 
there was any interest in, you know, having this commemoration, which was to take place in a 
couple years.  And we were amazed that older people came out and they began to share their 
stories.  There were incredible stories.  Some of them were heart-wrenching stories.  Some just, I 
mean, uh, it was just tear jerkers hearing what these, the terror that these people went through 
during that era of the Civil Rights Movement led by Dr. Hayling and Dr. King.  And, uh, so from 
that meeting on, we decided we’re going to, we’re going to just bring these people back to St. 
Augustine, invite them and so they can tell their stories and, you know, just get together and not 
necessarily, uh, have a joyous time, but commemorate and remember and recognize what 
happened in St. Augustine because it was, it was hidden.  It was hidden by the power structure of 
St. Augustine, who didn’t want to acknowledge that something like that ever happened.  
I remember one meeting we had at, uh, it was on DeSoto Place and J. T. Johnson would 
come in and he, he flew in from Atlanta.  We invited him to come and there was a demonstrator 
sitting in the audience and he said, “Why don’t you all let sleeping dogs lie? Why bring this up 
again? Just leave it alone.  Let it go.” And J. T. Johnson stood up and he said, “It’s just time to 
just say thank you.” And that struck me even to this day and we just wanted to say thank you.  
We wanted to bring these people back and just say, “Thank you for the sacrifices that you made 
for us.”  
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11

I know it probably was disappointing to some of them who fought so much, you know, to 
make life better for the next generation and the generations after to come back and see things had 
not changed much here in St. Augustine.  St. Augustine at one point didn’t appreciate its black 
history.  I learned later in life that, uh, that the first free black settlement in the United States was 
Fort Mose, you know, and that made me know why my ancestors came so far and risked so much 
to come to this place of sanctuary because it was a sanctuary for blacks at one point.  But things 
have changed.  They are not the same even now and it makes want to cry.  It brings me to tears to 
know that, uh, all that Dr. Hayling fought for, all that Dr. Martin Luther King did here in this 
town, that some things still remain the same.  But, and I will wipe my tears away, I am so 
thankful, I am so, uh, grateful for the sacrifices made by these people.  I want them to know that 
their sacrifice was not in vain for me.   
I have five children.  Excuse me.  I have five children and we stress education, that they 
must get a good education in order to survive in this world.  But I have a son, uh, Zebulon 
Duncan, who graduated with an engineering degree from the University of Florida, industrial 
engineering degree in systems engineering, got a Bachelor’s degree, and he got back to this town 
seeking a job and could not find a job.  He was even qualified to treat, to teach geo, geometry, 
trigonometry, all of these high math courses, but he could not get a job in this city.  So he went 
back to school and got his, uh, Bachelor’s degree in building and construction and still couldn’t 
get a job in this city.  He wrote something that really touched my heart not too long ago and put 
it on, online, that the city that he loved will never be the city that he will come back to ever 
[20:00] again and this has been, this has been the norm for a lot of black people here in this, in 
this city.  I’m just going to tell the truth, you know, about it.  Uh, St. Augustine needs to change 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 11 of 18 
 
and the change is going to come and I don’t know who is going to make those changes.  Maybe 
it will be the young people who will come to make changes here.   
But, uh, about the Civil Rights Movement and the 40th ACCORD [formally the 40th 
Anniversary to Commemorate the Civil Rights Demonstrations, Inc.  (40th ACCORD), a non-
profit established 2003 to promote awareness of local movement history; placed thirty historical 
markers known as the ACCORD Freedom Trail Project], it has been a pleasure, it has been an 
honor these last eight years to bring recognition and honor to these folks, to enlighten the public 
about what happened here, the struggles that these people faced just, you know, for the basic 
human rights.  And, uh, I just thank God our, uh, organization, the 40th ACCORD, there are no 
paid employees.  Nobody gets paid and for a number of years, we weren’t even funded, you 
know, but the Northrup-Grumman Corporation, thank God, they, uh, they decided to give us a 
chance and they funded thirty historic, civ – civil rights markers in and around the city.  And I 
thank God that some city officials allowed this to happen and, uh, some private citizens offered 
and gave us permission to put these markers, these historic markers in their yard to tell the stories 
because there are many.  There are numerous stories of the sacrifices made by just local citizens 
and those who came from afar, you know, to help with this movement.  
And, uh, I’m, I’m just, uh, glad to be a part, you know, of bringing recognition to people 
like Dr. Robert Hayling, the St. Augustine Four, Audrey Neil Edwards [now Hamilton] and 
JoeAnn Anderson Ulmer.  We have a lady who’s a hundred.  She’ll be a hundred and seven years 
old this year who gave, her name is Mrs. Rena Ayers, who gave lodging and food to the many 
demonstrators who came from the North, to attorneys who came from the North to defend them 
in the courts.  And, uh, it is our hope that, uh, this knowledge of this American history is known 
not only in the United States, but afar as well around the world.  Uh, so if, uh, anybody watches 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 12 of 18 
 
this fifty, sixty, seventy years from today, they’ll know that, that there was some great people 
that walked among us, angels, I call them, and their sacrifices will not go in vain.  And I want my 
children to know about it, my grandchildren to know.  I want everyone to know what happened 
here in St. Augustine, Florida.  
JM: Let me ask you kind of a hard question, which is, which is what are the things that 
haven’t changed that are the problems now as you line them up and, and see them in the, in the 
city around you? 
GD: Uh, there are not a lot of jobs and opportunities for blacks here in St. Augustine.  
Uh, if you went up and down the streets, you probably wouldn’t even find, you probably could 
count on your hand the black businesses and I doubt if one hand would cover it.  There was a 
loss of jobs, uh. 
JM: Doubt if one hand wouldn’t cover it probably. 
GD: Yeah, one hand probably wouldn’t, you know, cover those jobs, I mean, you know, 
those businesses.  Uh, there’s not a lot of blacks in the city government.  There’s not a lot of 
blacks even in any type of, uh, you know, administration and power here in St. Augustine, to me, 
you know, and St. Johns County.  And, uh, a lot of people have just left the, the city.  The young 
people have left and I don’t know if they will return. 
JM: Like your son, like your son as well. 
GD: Yes. 
JM: Yeah. 
GD: But he doesn’t live that far away.  He’s right over in Jackonsville and, uh, his wife is 
a, a, a professional, internal medicine.  She, uh, has an M.D. in internal medicine.  Uh, my, I 
have a daughter who has a doctorate degree in physical therapy, but she, she’s here in St. 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 13 of 18 
 
Augustine.  She has a job now, but, uh, she’s looking to go elsewhere and she just came back 
here a few months ago from Ocala, Florida, and she’s thinking about moving to Hawaii for a 
little while and, you know, just seeing the United States.  But, um, if we could get job 
opportunities bla – back here, I think, uh, there, there would be a change made in St. Augustine. 
JM: Yeah.  Tell me, I’m, I’m interested in the, in the reaction to the placement of the 
Freedom Trail markers. 
GD: Well, uh. 
JM: And the range of reaction, maybe, is the right way to ask the question. 
GD: Well, they are like, uh, [25:00] as Ambassador Young said, they are like weeds 
growing up, uh, you know.  Uh, I guess the atmosphere now is better than it used to be, I can 
even say, two or three years ago.  There is a demand to know about the history.  There are 
tourists coming in asking about the, uh, Civil Rights Movement.  Some didn’t even know it was 
a movement here and when they heard about it through, I guess, “Crossing in St. Augustine” 
[film produced by Andrew Young] that Ambassador Young did, that brought a lot of recognition 
to the movement.  Some did even know Dr. King even came, but, uh, I think now the, with the 
new city manager, uh, you know, that attit – [attitude], with Ambassador Young coming, the, uh, 
the attitude has changed, a, a little bit. And I guess that once history that was covered up by the 
city is now being embraced because they see and I’m thinking because it’s a money maker, you 
know, and I, and I believe the dollars, the revenue that can be generated is the driving factor 
now. 
JM: Do you think that, do you think that that’s ultimately the calculation that motivated 
the city’s willingness to place the trail markers and the foot soldiers monuments rather than a, 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 14 of 18 
 
more a sort of a deeper moral transformation? I mean, I know you can’t really know the answer 
for sure, but. 
GD: Well, uh, the foot soldiers monument, that was a private venture. 
JM: Yeah. 
GD: I mean, the city took credit after it was – 
JM: Yeah. 
GD: You know, the money was there and, you know, but – 
JM: But at least they sort of, if they weren’t welcoming, at least they didn’t do what all 
that they could have from stopping it from happening.  I can say that, I guess. 
GD: Mmm hmm.  I think, uh, the wheels were turning and then it just wasn’t going to 
stop.  I mean, people were going to keep coming, you know, and like I said, a lot of the people 
that gave us permission were private citizens to put those markers in, in their yards, uh. 
JM: Right, right. 
GD: But the city, I guess the attitudes have changed somewhat and you know with the 
advent of the, uh, Ambassador Young coming back here and previewing his movie, that, that, I 
mean, really things took off after that.   
JM: Ah, just more exposure. 
GD: Yes, more, very much.  It was national exposure.   
JM: How do you, how do you evaluate the motives of Northrup-Grumman? 
GD: Well, you know what? I just, I’m going to attribute that to just God’s blessings 
because I had wrote a letter to the management there asking for funding, you know, to help with 
the commemorations, the recognitions, the services that we were having, and, uh, it fell in the 
right hands.  That’s what I, I say.  Uh, the Lord just blessed and it opened up their hearts because 
Gwendolyn Annette Duncan Interview, 12-3-11 
 
 
Page 15 of 18 
 
the history shows that, uh, Fairchild-Hiller [Corp.], the company that was previously there, they 
were not very friendly to the civil rights demonstrators or the blacks that were employed there.  
Uh, and I, I attribute it to the people coming from the North.  You know, the attitudes were not 
the same as those that were here in the south.  Mmm hmm. 
JM: Yeah, yeah 
JB: Joe, I’m going to pause for a second.   
[break in conversation] 
 
JB: We’re back. 
 
JM: We’re back after a brief, just a very brief pause to, um, change recording tracks. 
 
JB: It’s okay. 
 
JM: Okay.  Um, Mrs. Duncan, let me, let me ask you for, you’ve been so patient to 
accommodate our crazy schedule today and I, this, this history runs so broad and deep, it’s, it’s 
hard to, to have just a, a relatively small amount of time.  But I want to ask you, are there other 
things when you tell this story and help people understand St. Augustine, other things that we 
should spend some time talking about, themes, episodes, incidents? 
 
GD: Well, St. Augustine, I’m going to tell you, it is a great little town.  I mean, it, I 
always thought it was a wonderful place to raise a family because it’s quiet.  You know, after 
being, being in New York City, you know, just visiting, I would not want to raise kids in, in, in 
New York City.  St. Augustine was a, is a quiet town, a peaceful town, but as, uh, Hank Thomas 
said, it is paternalistic, as though we need caring for, you know, as though we can’t take care of 
ourselves, your know.  But, uh, it’s a tourist town and, uh, they need to bring some more industry 
into the city.  I can see the city of St. Augustine remaining old and, you know, uh, historic, but 
the county itself needs to open up to industry where people will come back and blacks will be, it

will be a place that they can come and raise their families, like it used to be.  I would like to see 
it like it used to be.   
 
JM: Yeah. 
 
GD: [30:00] It was good growing up in Lincolnville.  It was good growing up in St. 
Augustine.  And there were thousands of black people here.  They have just taken flight out of 
this place and I think something needs to be done to draw the people back.   
 
JM: What’s next for 40th ACCORD?  
 
GD: Well, uh, we have, uh, an upcoming speaker.  Uh, we always commemorate the 
anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act.  This past July, we had, uh, Dr. Dorothy 
Cotton come.  She was our keynote speaker and our guest speaker was Sonja Plumber.  She was 
the granddaughter of one of the civil rights activists here, Rev. Goldie Eubanks.  Uh, come July 
2012, uh, we have, uh, author Taylor Branch coming and, uh, that’s, that will be our signature 
event, the, uh.  And we do Freedom Trail tours from time to time to educate the public and 
tourists who come, who want to know about the history, uh. 
 
JM: And you help, you help, uh, with the whole series of, uh, materials and training for 
schoolteachers.   
 
GD: Yes.  We’ve done two workshops in the, uh, and we’ve gotten permission from the 
superintendant of schools and we did two workshops, uh, for the teachers of St. Johns County 
and it was wonderful and we had one at St. Augustine High School.  Dr. Hayling was the 
speaker.  We had brought in Miss Lillian Twine Roberson.  Uh, it was numerous speakers to 
share their stories with the teachers.  We put together a, a workbook, um, of civil rights 
activities: pictures, documents, for the teachers.  The first year, Northrup-Grumman funded it 
and, uh, uh, I guess two years later, we did it again and we put them on,  you know, the

workbook on a CD.  But funding has been an issue, you know, for the 40th ACCORD in getting 
pro – programs done because it wasn’t a popular subject and we sought state, federal, uh, you 
know, city, state, and county, federal funds, but never were approved.  It wasn’t for the 
Northrup-Grumman, you know, this story would not have gotten out.   
So, uh, but our, I guess our long-term goal is to establish a civil rights museum here in St. 
Augustine.  That is, it’s not just the 40th ACCORD.  We have, uh, the 40th ACCORD started an 
organization, uh, I guess a committee, and we had a meeting and they decided to come up from 
under the umbrella of ACCORD because it’s such a big venture and, uh, we have the, uh, 
chairman, Richard [P.] Burton out of Jacksonville, who is a national NAACP board member.  
He’s our chair, J. T. Johnson co-chair.  We have the president of Flagler College on that 
committee.  The mayor is on that committee.  And, uh, we’re looking by 2014 to have something 
up and running, not the multimillion-dollar facility that Ambassador Young has, uh, great hopes 
of, uh, raising funds for, but something to celebrate and commemorate the fifieth anniversary of 
the Civil Rights Act in St. Augustine. 
JM: Yeah, yeah.  Well, it’s just been a great honor and privilege.  I really want to thank 
you and, um, it’ll be really great to watch all those plans move forward.   
GD: Yes. 
JM: So thank you for all that you’ve done and all that you’re doing. 
GD: Thank you. 
JM: And thanks for joining us today. 
GD: Mmm hmm.  Thank you. 
JM: Thank you.  Mmm, wow.  [clapping]
