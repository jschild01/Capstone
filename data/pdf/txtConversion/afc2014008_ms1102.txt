 Other members  who  wish  to
 
participate but whose names are not on this list are requested to inform Grace Koch,
 
Sound Archivist, AIATSIS. GPO Box 553, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia so she can prepare
 
sufficient copies of materials and space for all participants.
 Questions specific to
 
the Meeting/Seminar should be addressed to Koch;  other information should be sent to
 
Smith as usual.
 
The seminar,  in short presentations by especially invited indigenous performers and
 
broadcasters and discussion by all of us, will address the following:  (
1) the use of
 
the media to disseminate indigenous music and dance;  (
2) the effects of the media on
 
indigenous performance; (
3) indigenous control of how performance is represented by the
 
media.
 One  guest,  a specialist  in audiovisual  communication with  remote areas  of
 
Australia, will inform us of this activity.  All Study Group members are encouraged to
 
bring data from their research area (
and/or, if relevant, their place of residence) to
 
contribute to our discussions.  Also, to respond to the request for information on the
 
earliest  sound  recordings made  in  the various  parts  of  Oceania,  participants  are
 
encouraged to bring information on early, relatively unknown recordings including, if
 
known, place of deposit.  Study Group members who are not able to attend the seminar in
 
person  are welcome  to  send  relevant  data  (
in  print  form)  from  their  research  or
 
residence area to Koch (
to reach her by 20 December 1994 so it will be available for
 
the discussions).
 
A block  of  rooms  at  Burgmann  College  is  available  for  us for the duration of  the
 
Seminar (through the night of the 14th in case anyone finds it inconvenient to depart
 
on the 14th).

Documentation Project)--a joint  research project  of  Solomon  Islands  Nat'l  Museum,
 
Solomon  Islands  Nat'l  Archives,  Solomon  Islands  Broadcasting  Corp.  and Musicology
 
Division  of Osaka Univ. —conducted  research  in Maringe  and  Hograno  areas of  Santa
 
Isabel  Island  with cooperation  of  the  Isabel  Province.
 All  items  of  traditional
 
skills, musical performance,  and oral tradition were recorded using professional 8mm
 
and U-matic video, DAT, and color slides.  Publication is expected.
 
Takamine, a kumu hula (master teacher of Hawaiian dance) who teaches hula at the Univ.
 
of  Hawai'i  at  Manoa and  at Leeward  Community College,  completed  the M
.A.  with a
 
concentration in Dance Ethnology, in 1994.  Her thesis is entitled "Hula '
Ala'apapa: an
 
analysis of selected dances and a comparison with hula pahu."
 
Thomas presented a paper in Wellington in March 1994 entitled "Dance Costume in Island
 
Polynesia" at a conference "Under Capricorn: Is Art A Western idea?"  Concentrating on
 
the dance costume of smaller islands (especially Tokelau and Tuvalu) it looked for the
 
historical antecedents of the costume today.
 A copy of his paper could be supplied to
 
any Study Group member who is interested.
 
Thomas (and Jennifer Shennan) would be interested to hear from any Study Group member
 
who has made an index (
or has started to make one, or has access to one) of the tapes
 
issued from the Pacific Arts Festival in Tahiti.
 They would like to compile better
 
documentation of these otherwise very useful study tapes.  They already have the notes
 
for the JVC Video Anthology of World Music and Dance for the performances copied to it.
 
Deaths  
Ihaia Puka,  the Tokelau Island composer,  has died in Wellington aged 87 years.
 His
 
life and works were researched by Allan Thomas and Ineleo Tuia in 1989 for "Profile of
 
a composer: Ihaia Puka a Pulotu of the Tokelau Islands" (Oral Traditions 5
, 2/3, 1990).
 
His funeral was an occasion for the singing of his songs and recalling the anecdotes
 
and  sometimes  pungent  criticisms  with  which  he  entertained  and  enlightened  his
 
community.
 
Emily Kau ' i-o--Makaweli-ona-lani-o-ka-Mano-o-

 The 1990 Merrie Monarch Hula Festival
 
included a special program to honor her.  At the wake, members of her halau and friends
 
remembered her in words,  song and hula;  and to conclude the funeral service in the
 
Catholic Church,  the members of her family encircled all those present and conveyed
 
their loving farewell through a hula.
 Her halau continues under the direction of her
 
daughter, Noenoe Lewis, who also teaches at the Univ. of Hawai'i at Manoa.

2-13 January 1995, Canberra
  
Plans are progressing for a wonderful Study Group Meeting with the theme "
Indigenous
 
Performance and the Media."  Grace Koch, sound archivist for music and oral history at
 
AJATSIS (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies) will be
 
our Canberra organiser.
 (
Those of our members who participated in the ICTM Colloquium
 
in Townsville in 1
988 will remember her from that event.)
 AIATSIS is undertaking to
 
bring some indigenous broadcasters and performers who have worked with the media (
both
 
aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islanders) to participate.  Several Study Group
 
members are also trying to arrange to bring indigenous performers and/or broadcasters
 
and/or scholars from their areas,  so we hope there will be some representation from
 
Australia, Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia and Papua New Guinea.  This should give us
 
a wonderful  perspective  on current  indigenous  views  and  inform our  discussions  on
 
related matters  (
early sound recordings from the Oceanic region,  ethics,  copyright,
 
etc.)
 Questionnaires  returned  to  date  show  1
7  members  intending  (or  hoping)  to
 
participate:  Barwick,  Burke,  Coleman,  Christensen,  Crowe,  Feltz,  Kartomi,  Kelsey,
 
Lawrence,  Marshall,  Moulin,  Niles,  Smith,  Spearritt,  Trimillos,  Wild,  Yamaguti.
 2
 
members have not yet considered it; 3 do not plan to participate).
 Members who have
 
not yet returned the questionnaire (enclosed in Circular No. 29) but who do plan and/or
 
hope to attend the meetings, are urged to return them as soon as possible to be sure t
o
 
receive meeting-specific  '
mini-circulars'  that may be sent at more frequent intervals
 
than our regular Circulars.

 26 November 1993
 
Circular No. 29
 
IC T
h 33rd World Conference, 5-11 January 1995, Canberra, Australia
  
This World Conference and our Study Group meeting immediately following it should be
 
a wonderful opportunity for our members to present results of their research and to
 
share  information of mutual  interest.
 Please  send  proposals  for  papers  to  the
 
Program Chair,  Prof.  Dieter Christensen, as soon as possible (and in no case later
 
than will assure his receipt by 30 April 1994).  Our Study Group has proposed a panel
 
for the World Conference which we hope will be accepted for the program.
 It is a
 
revision of Stillman's suggestion (
circulated in Circular No. 27).  Because the topic
 
is appropriate to the interests of so many of our members (and to the location of the
 
meeting),  we have  requested a double  time  slot  so more  Study Group members  can
 
participate in it.  We expect that, if accepted, there will be only a short lead time
 
for submitting the names of the panelists and their specific topics, so members who
 
expect to attend the Conference and would like to be considered for participation in
 
the panel should contact the organizer promptly: Dr. Amy K
. Stillman, Department of
 
Music, University of California at Santa Barbara,  Santa Barbara,  California 93106-
6070 USA.  As submitted, the proposal reads as follc
:
 
OCEANIC MUSIC AND DANCE
 
IN EXPATRIATE AND RELOCATED COMMUNITIES
 
A Panel Proposal by
 
The IC T
h Study Group on Musics of Oceania
 
Amy Ku'uleialoha Stillman, Organizer
 
This  panel will  focus  on  a fairly  neglected aspect  of Oceanic  performing
 
traditions, namely, their maintenance and/or transformation in communities away from
 
the "land of birth."  We propose to consider the following questions:
 
What  kinds  of  interaction  do  expatriate  residents  conduct with  homeland
 
residents with respect to performing traditions?
 Are expatriate residents "avant-
garde," "up  to  date"  or  conservatively  "old-fashioned"  vis-a-vis innovations  or
 
trends  in  the  homeland?
 Do  interactions  in multicultural  coalitions  (e.g.  the
 
Pacific Islander Council in Los Angeles, USA,  and the Council for Maori and South
 
Pacific Arts in Wellington,  NEW ZEALAND)  promote creative adaptation of music and
 
dance  features  among  Oceanic  traditions,  or  is  emphasis  placed  on asserting
 
distinctiveness?
 And  what  impacts are  there  of  non-indigenous  participants  as
 
students, performers, and presenters?
 
Please remember that you can present a paper and also participate in a panel; also
 
that membership status must be current —so check to make sure your dues are paid.
 
IC T
h Study Group on Musics of Oceania Meeting, 1
2-13 January 1995, Canberra
  
In Berlin in June 1993, most of the topics we had suggested for the World Conference
 
were accepted as themes (and our members can propose to address them through papers).
 
So our Study Group meeting should probably focus primarily on mass media and Oceanic
 
music and dance.  At an informal gathering of some SGMO members during the recent SEM
 
meeting, it was suggested that we request a visit/tour of resources of the Institute
 
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Studies as our first activity (
12 January).
 
In the afternoon we (
and,  perhaps also invited media personnel) would discuss the
 
import of mass media on traditional arts and early sound recordings from the region
 
(members would bring data to discuss rather than preparing formal papers).
 There
 
will probably be an evening activity.  In the morning of 13 January--if we succeed in
 
bringing a few bearers/carriers of traditions (who are not necessarily members of the
 
Study Group)--they may be asked to share their perspectives on how the electronic
 
media affect their own performance.  We did not propose the content for the afternoon
 
session because we want all members to have a chance to give feedback on Lhe  above
 
and  to  submit  further  ideas/requests  to  Smith  for  circulation.
 Departure  is
 
anticipated for the morning of 14 January (which will allow us to get home for the
 
beginning of the work week).  Of course, all this is tentative until our  host, Wild,
 
can consider its feasibility.
 
Please return the enclosed questionnaire as promptly as possible--its receipt here in
 
January '
94 will help us in planning a stimulating and worthwhile meeting.

IC T
h Study Group on Musics of Oceania Meeting, 12-13 January, 1995, Canberra
  
Our Study Group will meet at the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders
 
Studies immediately after the World Conference (our hosts cannot schedule it before
 
the Conference but with Saturday and Sunday —and for North Americans an extra day due
 
to the international dateline —we can easily be home before Monday classes).  At our
 
meeting in Berlin (
see below) we agreed to encourage our members to propose papers
 
and panels for the World Conference and,  for our Study Group Meeting, to recommend:
 
1
. that a topic be chosen in advance and members encouraged to bring relevant data to
 
have at hand for discussion of it (rather than a format of formal papers/panels); and
 
2
. that we bring a few bearers of Oceanic traditions —not necessarily members of IC T
h
 
--to share their views on this topic (
and perhaps on other concerns that may guide
 
some of our future activities).  We propose the topic: Mass Media and Dissemination
 
of Oceanic Music and Dance.
 Our meeting will also include a tour of the facilities
 
at IATSIS followed by discussion of some Pacific-specific aspects of archives.
 
Past Conferences and Meetings

Some  Study  Group  members  presented  papers  or  participated  in  panels  on  other
 
subjects, chaired  sessions and/or were involved with committee and Board activities.
 
During the Conference, our Study Group was asked to suggest themes for the Canberra
 
World Conference for consideration by the committee for the host institution,  the
 
Program Committee  and the Board.
 So we hurriedly planned a mid-Conference lunch
 
meeting and agreed on three topics (each with subtopics) plus two others.
 Most of
 
these (with some differences in wording) are included in the official list of themes.
 
2

 We greatly appreciate Simon's
 
arrangements for us to visit the Museum fur Volkerkunde's South Seas Collection where
 
we saw some items of major significance to studies in Oceanic music and dance and to
 
meet in his office where,  over refreshments, we learned about some advantages and
 
disadvantages of various formats used in the Museum's publications of audio materials
 
and discussed plans for our Canberra meeting (
see above).
 During the following two
 
days, four members undertook individual research in the South Seas collection and the
 
audio archive of the Ethnomusicology Section.
 
3
.  The Pacific Arts Association 5th International Symposium was held in Adelaide,

Performance,  b
. Music Performance,  c
.  Visual Arts);  Art and Aesthetics; Mission of
 
Museums;  Intellectural Property and Copyright.
 There were also workshops and film
 
sessions.
 The opening ceremony included dances of Torres Strait Islands, Malangan
 
Mask Dance (PNG), Sulka Mask Dance (PNG) and the closing event was the Message Stick
 
Ceremony with Arnhemland and South Australian participants.
 Among the programmed
 
papers, the titles of several were relevant to our Study Group's interests (

EARLY RECORDINGS OF COOK I
SLANDER AND NE W ZEALAND
 
MAORI VOCAL M USIC IN THE GRAINGER MUSEU M, MELBOURNE,
 
AUSTRALIA
 
The Grainger Museum was e
stablished a
t t
he University o
f Melbourne by
 
t
he Australian-born p
ianist and c
omposer, Percy Aldridge Grainger, i
n
 
1
938.  I
t c
ontains c
ollections o
f both musical and non-musical materials,
 
t
he majority o
f which were a
cquired by Grainger h
imself.  Although
 
Grainger became a c
itizen o
f t
he United S
tates o
f America i
n 1
918, and
 
l
ived most o
f h
is l
i
fe i
n White P
lains, New York, he gave e
xtended c
oncert
 
t
ours i
n many parts o
f t
he world and c
ontinued t
o be c
losely a
ssociated
 
with New Zealand and Australia, e
specially Melbourne which was h
is
 
b
irthplace.
 
I
n 1
908-1909, Grainger gave c
oncerts i
n New Zealand and Australia.
 
During t
his c
oncert t
our, he heard r
ecordings o
f Rarotongan and Maori
 
music, made by Alfred J
.
 Knocks, a
 r
esident o
f t
he Otaki d
istrict. Knocks
 
had a
ttended t
he I
nternational Exhibition i
n Christchurch i
n 1
906-07, and
 
he was probably t
he only person t
o have had t
he f
oresight t
o r
ecord t
he
 
s
ongs and chants o
f v
isiting performers f
rom t
he s
outhern Cook I
slands
 
(
Reeves 1
982).  Grainger f
irst met Knocks i
n a hotel a
t Otaki (
north o
f
 
Wellington). Knocks had b
rought a
 f
ew phonograph cylinders t
o p
lay f
or
 
Grainger whose excitement on hearing t
he music was such t
hat he
 
overcame Knocks's r
eluctance t
o t
ake h
im home.  He spent t
he entire
 
n
ight a
t Knocks's ho me, a
tte mpting t
o t
ranscribe t
he music f
rom t
he
 
cylinder r
ecordings. Knocks, who was a
 p
akeha married t
o a
 mori, spoke
 
t
he Maori l
anguage f
luently and was able t
o t
ranslate many o
f t
he s
ong
 
t
exts f
or Grainger.
 
About t
he Rarotongan music, Grainger (
1909a) wrote t
o h
is mother:
 
.
the r
eal musicalness o
f t
hese s
ongs!  They go f
ast with swinging
 
hammering pattering r
hythms, & t
he whole e
ffect o
f t
he g
roup o
f
 
s
ingers i
s l
ike a band o
f banjos, spluttering, wiring i
n, b
razen
 
t
ongues. A f
oresinger s
tarts o
ff & t
he o
ther[s] waltz i
n a
t t
he end o
f
 
t
he f
i
rst phrase. I
t i
s t
horoly [
s
ic] many v

i

he most part... not a

s
ic] t
he voicing o
f "
the j
oy o
f l
i
fe", where e
lse s
hall I
 l
ook f
or i
t
?
 
Grainger had not v
isited t
he Cook I
s
lands a
t t
he t
ime o
f writing t
his l
etter
 
i
n 1
909 and 1
5 years were t
o pass before he was able t
o s
ee t
hem f
or
 
h
i mself.
 
Knocks a
lso had r
ecorded New Zealand Maori t
angi and haka, and
 
Grainger was equally enthusiastic about t
his music:
 
0, t
he Maori hakas!  The g
rand wild r
hythms o
f t
he m r
ing
 
bewitchingly i
n t
he memory o
f my e
ars...
 
To perform a
 haka must g
ive more j
oy t
han t
o perform any o
ther
 
a
rt I
 know, a
lmost. For one not only shouts wild bold words, with
 
t
he r
hythmic pulse o
f a
 l
ot o
f f
ellow hakamen f
loating one a
long,
 
but a
cco mpanies t
he chanting with desperate v
iolent wanton
 
abandoned movement o
f t
he whole body! Musical f
ootball.
 
(Grainger 1
909b)
 
So me years l
ater, Grainger persuaded Knocks t
o l
end h
im t
he o
riginal
 
phonograph cylinders.
 Grainger had copies o
f t
hese moulded i
n
 
Den mark.  These were subsequently housed i
n h
is c
ollection a
t t
he
 
Grainger Museum, t
ogether with s
everal o
f Grainger
's dubbed c
opies onto
 
a
cetate d
iscs.  The manuscripts o
f Grainger's a
ttempts t
o t
ranscribe t
his
 
vocal music a
re a
lso i
n t
he Museum's c
ollection.  Regrettably, Grainger
 
never c
ompleted h
is t
ranscriptions.
 
I
n 1
984, Chris Long, a
 s
ound a
rchives t
echnical e
xpert, dubbed t
he Edison
 
phonograph c
opies onto t
ape.  The i
dentification o
f t
he i
tems was based
 
upon l
i
sts o
f a
rchival materials t
hat I
 c
o mpiled during my years a
s
 
Assistant Curator a
t t
he Grainger Museum. These l
i
sts were subsequently
 
published i
n t
he I
nternational Association f
or S
ound Archives Australian
 
Branch Newsletter (
Reeves 1
984).  Further c
opies o
