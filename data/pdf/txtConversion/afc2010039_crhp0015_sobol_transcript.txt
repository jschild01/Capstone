interview to touch on, um, Mr. Sobol’s, uh, career as an attorney and some connection, too, to 
Bogalusa. 
Um, and I think that’s the quick setup, so Mr. Sobol and Mrs. Sobol, thank you so much 
for welcoming us today.  It’s very nice to be with you. 
Richard Sobol:  You’re welcome.  We’re glad to have you here. 
JM:  Yeah, thank you.  Mr. Sobol, let me start, if I could, just to have you give a basic 
sketch of your childhood, um, family and upbringing in New York City. 
RS:  Um, I grew up in New York City.  I lived on the West Side of Manhattan.  My father 
was a lawyer.  My mother was a mathematics teacher in one of the high schools in New York.  
Um, I, uh, went through schools in New York.  I went to the Bronx High School of Science and I 
went to college at Union College in Schenectady, New York, and came back to New York to go 
to Columbia Law School. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, always had sort of anticipated you’d be a lawyer? 
RS:  My father was a lawyer, and I was – it was explained to me early on that I was going 
to be a lawyer, and I accepted that.  [Laughter] 
JM:  Did you, um – did civil rights come into your kind of active attention as you were 
busy with the Law Review while at Columbia, or –? 
RS:  Um, I wrote something about the gerrymander decision of the Supreme Court in 
Alabama while I was in law school, um, um, which was published, and, um – but really, the truth 
is that for the most part I was focusing on the work and so forth until I got out of law school. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, if you would, could you just sketch the early career path, um, that will 
bring you to New Orleans? 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11

RS:  I went from law school to being a law clerk, uh, for Judge Paul Hays on the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was a one-year position.  And then, I came 
to Washington and for a few months I worked for a commissioner as a special assistant to a 
commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission.  And in the spring of 1963, I went to work for 
what was then Arnold, Fortas & Porter as an associate, what was then a very small, 
comparatively small law firm in Washington. 
JM:  And anticipating at the time that that would be a position you’d stay with for some 
time, I would imagine, or perhaps not. 
RS:  Yes, I guess that’s true.  Um, I had certain illusions about what that firm was all 
about.  Abe Fortas had just handled, um, a very famous case in the Supreme Court, um, 
involving the right to counsel in state court criminal proceedings.  Um, and I kind of got the 
mistaken, naïve idea there was going to be a lot of that kind of thing at the law firm.  Thurman 
Arnold had been a – had been prominent in representing individuals who had been called before 
the McCarthy Committee and other committees along the lines of the McCarthy Committee.  So, 
uh, I had stars in my eyes about what it was, and it turned out to be quite different. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Tell me how you first, um, got connected to the Lawyers Constitutional 
Defense Committee. 
RS:  Um, in 1964, the spring of 1964, two friends of mine, colleagues at Arnold, Fortas & 
Porter, young men like myself, uh, became aware of and told me about the Lawyers 
Constitutional Defense Committee, which was sending lawyers, um, in the summer to the South 
to help with the arrests that essentially were resulting from all the civil rights activity that was 
taking place.  Um, I volunteered to go in 1964, but a lot of other people did as well, and I wasn’t 
accepted for the reason that they were looking for lawyers who were admitted in the states in 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 4 of 59 
 
which these problems were most manifest, and, um, I wasn’t.  My two friends were admitted in 
Florida, and they were sent [05:00] down there. 
And I was kind of unhappy that I wasn’t allowed to do this.  And during the course of 
the, uh, the following winter, I met the director of the program, Henry Schwartzchild, at the 
home of one of these two men, and I complained to him about this.  And he promised me that I’d 
be selected next summer, [laughing] and I was.  In the summer of 1965, I was, um – they would 
send lawyers for three weeks on their – on the lawyers’ vacations.  And, um, I was told I was 
going to be included, but I didn’t know where.  And a letter came that said, “You’re assigned to 
New Orleans, Louisiana,” which was a big disappointment to me, because I wanted to go to 
Selma, Alabama, or [laughs] Jackson, Mississippi, or someplace that I had heard of where things 
were happening.  Of course, things were happening here; I just didn’t know it. 
And, uh – but that letter changed my life, because I got here the first of August, 1965, 
and, uh, I spent my three weeks.  I outlined a little bit in those documents I gave you what I did 
during those times.  But it was very, uh, uh, enlightening, awakening for me, because, um – a 
couple of factors.  One is where I was working in Washington, when there was a case they put 
four lawyers on it, and, uh, sometimes lawyers, fulltime, would work on one case, and the case 
would take years, and that was kind of the way of life. 
Um, here things were happening with breakneck speed.  Um, when I showed up for work 
the first day, I asked them what I could do.  They said, “Drive up to Baton Rouge and meet 
Murphy [Wilbert] Bell.  He has a school case he wants to bring.”  And I did, and I went to Baton 
Rouge and met this gentleman, who was the key black lawyer in that area for civil rights things, 
and he said that the people in St. Francisville, West Feliciana Parish, want to bring a school 
desegregation case. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 5 of 59 
 
So, I said, “Fine,” and I went up there and I met them and I got their names and addresses 
and consents and so forth, and went back to New Orleans.  And, um, a desegregation case by that 
– a school desegregation case by that time was a pretty stock thing.  You get someone else’s 
complaint and you put the new names in and, um, file it.  And I did and I filed it in Baton Rouge, 
where – which was the district for that location. 
And, um, the judge there was a well known racist judge named E. Gordon West, and he 
would just throw all these cases out the minute they got there, even though it was established law 
of the land that these cases were proper cases.  And the day after I filed it, the case was 
dismissed.  And I filed a motion in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a summary reversal of, 
uh, of Judge West’s decision.  And a week later, the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision and sent 
it back, uh, for the entry of an order.  In fact, they told him exactly what order to enter. 
So, I had been there for eight days [laughter], and I had gotten relief in a school 
desegregation case in the face of the worst judge in the South, or practically, or one of them 
anyway.  And that was just one of several things I did during three weeks, and, uh, I could just 
see the impact, uh, I could have, uh, in this situation.  A lot of lawyers who were being sent 
down by LCDC, um, were also enjoying the life in New Orleans and, um, bringing their wives 
and different things that seemed to me a little bit of a messy situation in that, um – I came away 
with the firm idea that what they need is permanent lawyers down there and not people passing 
through. 
And, uh, I was working with a law firm, Collins, Douglas & Elie, which is a very 
important, the most important firm in civil rights law in Louisiana, three young black lawyers 
who became the attorneys for the Congress of Racial Equality, which was the dominant civil 
rights organization in Louisiana.  And, uh, I became friends with them, we liked each other, and, 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 6 of 59 
 
uh, we began to talk about my coming down on a more permanent basis, and one thing led to 
another.  At the time, there was permanent staff member in Jackson, Mississippi, which was the 
main office.  And over that winter, uh, Mr. Schwartzchild raised the money to have a permanent 
lawyer in New Orleans, and I was going to be it.  And, uh, the following summer, I came down 
as an employee and stayed. 
JM:  Um-hmm.  So, that’s – that’s, then, summer of ’66? 
RS:  Six. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, let me take you back.  Um, it’s so interesting to hear you talk about your 
arrival down here and those first three weeks.  Um, can you say a little bit about – had you 
traveled in the South previously? 
RS:  No. 
JM:  No? 
RS:  I’d gotten as far as Charleston, South Carolina [laughs] – 
JM:  Yeah, okay. 
RS:  Sightseeing. 
JM:  You’ve mentioned this [10:00] the impression that’s made upon a young lawyer by 
the experience you just described of getting this quick reversal.  I’m interested also to hear about, 
as you might recall them, other impressions that you formed early of the civil rights context in 
the South as you saw it when you came in that summer in ’65. 
RS:  Um, well, the office of Collins, Douglas & Elie was on the second floor, uh, in the 
2200 block of Dryades Street.  And on the ground floor, in the storefront, was the Congress of 
Racial Equality office.  So, I was meeting all these civil rights workers.  You know, I don’t, 
wouldn’t, didn’t consider myself a civil rights worker.  I was a lawyer doing this law work.  But 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 7 of 59 
 
they were all coming through and, uh, people I had heard of and read about, and, um, action was 
taking place everywhere, uh, including Bogalusa.  Bogalusa was always the most active place, 
partly because it’s so close, uh, and it was easy to get in and out.  It didn’t take two days 
roundtrip to do something. 
Uh, but I met the people, all the people in Bogalusa.  I met Bob Hicks, Gayle Jenkins, 
A.Z. Young, R.T. Young, many people.  I, uh – there was an affinity growing up [laughs] in me, 
and, um, I just wanted to be part of it on a more permanent basis than this little snapshot that I 
got.  Um, and any impression I had that there wasn’t civil rights activity in southern Louisiana 
was just completely dispelled, as I was mentioning in terms of my letter that I got.  Um, 
[someone coughs] and, um, that’s – that was my impression. 
JM:  Tell me a little bit more about these three black lawyers you met. 
RS:  Okay.  Um, they are among the first African American lawyers in Louisiana, but not 
the first.  There are older, uh, men who have streets named after them in New Orleans, A.P. 
Tureaud and, uh – the best example.  They were about ten years younger than he was.  It was 
Robert Collins, who later became a federal judge, um, the first black federal judge in the South; 
uh, Nils Douglas, um, who died just a few years ago and who, um, was I think probably the most 
active of the three, in terms of the representation to CORE; and Lolis Elie, who is, um, still my 
dear friend and lives right down the block [laughs] from here. 
And, uh, they were – it was a completely different scene than Arnold, Fortas & Porter – 
they were scraping to make a living.  They weren’t getting paid much by CORE.  They were 
very glad to have the help with the civil rights work, which freed them to do something that 
made a little money.  They would do the kind of work you do in a poor black neighborhood: 
automobile accidents, uh, bankruptcies, um, landlord-tenant issues, um, and, uh – but they were 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 8 of 59 
 
having a good time about it.  Every day at the end of the day – of the three, the one who had the 
largest office room was Bob Collins – everybody would gather in there.  He had a bottle of 
Scotch in his bottom drawer.  People would have a drink and talk about what they did, and it was 
a very attractive, [laughs] friendly situation. 
JM:  Um-hmm. 
RS:  Uh, things were very stern up at Arnold & Porter, and, uh, it – this was a nice 
contrast. 
JM:  Sure, sure.  Um, tell me a little bit about, if you would, um, some of your first 
impressions of, um, of, uh, Bogalusa, the community. 
RS:  Uh, the first word that comes to mind is hot.  Hot!  It was hot and smelly, uh, 
because of the paper mill.  Um, at that time, uh, they were having a meeting every single night.  
Uh, it was the Bogalusa Voters League, and the, uh, the people who were at the forefront were 
the people I mentioned, A.Z. Young, Robert Hicks, Gayle Jenkins.  And there was a union hall 
right near Robert Hicks’s house, um, and there was a meeting and a rally every single night.  
And, um, activities were planned.  There was a long period of time in Bogalusa that there was a 
protest march on Main Street – I’m not sure that Main Street is the name of the street, but the 
main street – in protest of discrimination by the store owners.  That would go on every day after 
school. 
Um, so it was – and the Civil Rights Acts had just passed.  Um, well, put it this way: the 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act had just come into effect, [15:00] uh, four weeks earlier, and 
there was a lot of focus on conditions at Crown Zellerbach [Corporation], uh, which was the 
major employer in town, had four plants, uh, making various kinds of paper products – boxes, 
wrapping paper, different things.  And, um, one of the things I did during my three weeks that 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 9 of 59 
 
first summer was to work on the EOC charge that was filed, which was a prerequisite to filing a 
Title VII action in court, and meeting a lot of the employees at the firm, at the plants, and hearing 
what they were doing and what their problems were. 
So, it was a very – oh, and there were things going on in the criminal court.  I, uh – there 
were arrests coming out of these, um, marches and arrests for other reasons, harassment arrests.  
And there was a city court, and, um, I appeared at least twice in, um, city court in Bogalusa, uh, 
which was completely segregated, uh, and had this kind of very angry judge sitting on the bench. 
And the first time I, um, uh, appeared, let me divert to say, Abe Fortas had just been 
appointed to the Supreme Court, like the week I left.  And Nils Douglas was with me, and he 
stood up.  He said, “Would it please the court, I want to introduce to the court Richard Sobol, 
who comes from the law firm in Washington, D.C. that, uh – from which the most recent 
Supreme Court nominee has come.” 
And this judge used a crutch, one crutch, to walk, and he took his crutch and he slammed 
it on the table and he said, “Don’t talk to me about the Supreme Court of the United States!”  
[Laughs] And, uh, that was my introduction to city court.  But he let me, he let me say what I 
wanted, and, uh, uh, I was before him at least two or three times in those three weeks. 
JM:  Um, I’m interested to hear a little bit, too, about, um, some of your first impressions 
about, um, [pause] some of your first impressions about how it felt for you to be stepping into 
this landscape personally.  I mean you mentioned the excitement on the legal side.  Did you – 
was it a more complex set of concerns, for example, about safety, about –? 
RS:  Well, another thing that happened just before I got here was that a bomb had been 
set off – had been tossed in the hallway to the Collins, Douglas & Elie office, so that was a 
conversation piece.  Somehow I don’t recall that bothering me.  Um, I came down here with my 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 10 of 59 
 
wife, my then-wife, and two children.  Uh, we found a nice apartment uptown that we could rent 
and, uh, just a block away from where Lolis Elie lived at the time, and, um, um, it all seemed 
fine to me.  I didn’t have any, any – I was so excited to be involved in it, uh, and grateful 
[laughs], in a way, to be involved in it.  And everybody was approving of what I was doing, you 
know, my wife then was, and everybody.  So, I didn’t have, uh, concerns.  I just got right into it. 
And when I arrived, there was, um, a volunteer, a regular volunteer who had been down 
several times, named Jerry Gutman, Jeremiah Gutman, from New York City, who, uh, filled out 
a file card for each pending case in the office.  And when I got there, he wanted me to – I sat 
down with him, and he wanted to go over each file card.  Well, the file cards were about four 
inches thick, and every one had a case, and I was the lawyer in every single one of those cases 
[laughs], as of that day. 
So, it was, um – there wasn’t a lot of time to be, you know, be worried about it.  I just 
was – got into it and tried to organize it in some – and I worked alone, but I honestly did, 
basically, the civil rights work with, uh – I was in association with the lawyers upstairs.  I was 
downstairs.  Um, but, um, uh, basically, I was supposed to take the lead and make sure these 
things happened and, uh, um, I did that alone for about four or five months. 
You see, I was so much – I was so – I felt they shouldn’t have this volunteer lawyer 
program.  And I convinced Henry Schwartzchild that – see, what they did is they flew the 
lawyers in and they paid the airfare and they paid the hotel bills.  Well, you could hire a lawyer 
for less than that.  Um, and, uh – but the problem was there weren’t many lawyers in Louisiana 
who wanted to do that. 
But I found one, a fellow named Don Juneau, um, who, uh, had recently [20:00] 
graduated from Tulane and he was – he’s a very unusual person.  And, uh, he’s white, but he’s a 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 11 of 59 
 
very unusual person and he wanted to do this.  So, by December – I came down fulltime in late 
July – by December he had joined the office.  And so, we had two lawyers, which was great, and 
I stopped having, pretty much stopped having the volunteers, which was kind of a distraction.  
And I think by that following summer, I had three – I had two lawyers, in addition to myself.  It 
got to be three.  At one point I reached four.  So, we really had a law office going and a lot of 
help and so on. 
JM:  Yeah.  Let me ask about the [clears throat] the complaint filed in ’65 and some that 
moved forward from there.  Did, uh, Collins, Douglas & Elie [the New Orleans-based firm of 
black attorneys Robert Collins, Nils Douglas, and Lolis Elie] have an active LDF connection, 
Legal Defense Fund connection? 
RS:  Uh, no. 
JM:  They didn’t? 
RS:  They didn’t.  They knew all the people and all, but, um, uh, they were CORE 
lawyers. 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  And there was a CORE organization – you know, the LDF started as the nonprofit 
part of the NAACP.  Now, of course, it’s completely different.  But there was a CORE thing that 
was called the Scholarship Education Defense Fund for Racial Equality.  CORE was the 
Congress of Racial Equality, and, um, that was their client.  And that was where the input from 
New York City would come in.  Uh, there was a man named Carl Rachlin who was the head of 
it, um, and he would come in and out of town. 
JM:  Yeah.  You mentioned filing that complaint.  The date was July 15 in ’65, just after, 
not two weeks after the Act has taken place – 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 12 of 59 
 
RS:  Yeah. 
JM:  Title VII has taken effect.  Um, I’m just remembering, um, that in those early days, 
you mentioned that you could borrow boilerplate filing on the school side. 
RS:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  Well, how did you come up with the complaint? 
RS:  Well, that complaint – you say July 15th, 1965?  I wasn’t – I’m not here yet.  But I 
thought the complaint, the charge wasn’t complete enough, and I redid it, um, to list the practices 
more specifically that I thought were a problem.  Uh, how they did the one in, um, in July, I 
don’t know.  I would guess it was a rush job, just from the circumstances.  Uh, the one I filed, 
uh, I had listed a lot of issues that later became prominent issues: testing and seniority and, uh, 
um, segregated local unions and different things that were not, I don’t think, mentioned in the 
first charge. 
JM:  Gotcha. 
RS:  But it was – that – you had to start over on a blank sheet of paper for that one, unlike 
the school segregation litigation, which was going on, you know, for quite some time – there was 
this famous New Orleans school desegregation case many years before – and, uh, much more 
established. 
JM:  Did you – after your arrival in early summer ’66, did you have an active pattern of 
communication with the part of LDF that was engaged in early Title VII work, or not really? 
RS:  No, I didn’t.  I don’t think LDF – if they had a Title VII case in Louisiana, I don’t 
know what it was. 
JM:  No, I don’t think that they did. 
RS:  I don’t think they did. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 13 of 59 
 
JM:  But you wouldn’t have called up to folks working on these issues in New York City 
to say, “Hey, what are you guys doing on these LDF – on the Title VII front?” 
RS:  No. 
JM:  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Um, I’d love to know some of your, to draw you out a little bit 
further about Bogalusa, um, some of your impressions about these key three individuals you 
mentioned and how and why it was that Bogalusa had become such an active place for struggle. 
RS:  Uh, let me answer the last question first.  It became active because of the three 
individuals.  And I think if they had been somewhere else, it would have been active somewhere 
else.  Uh, they had an unbelievable commitment and drive and perseverance to what they were 
trying to achieve. 
Um, and there were two other factors.  There was the Crown Zellerbach mill, which 
employed thousands, maybe a thousand people, and it wasn’t one of these southern towns where 
nobody really has a job, uh, you know, they’re making out in various ways.  But these are union 
workers, and they’re under union contract, and they were used to organization.  Um, and the – as 
far as employment was concerned, the complaints were quite clear.  Um, and, um, because 
Crown Zellerbach was from San Francisco, a group in San Francisco took a very active interest 
in supporting what they were doing, including sending money, [laughs] primarily sending 
money. 
JM:  Supporting what the black workers were attempting to do. 
RS:  What the Bogalusa Voters League was trying to do. [25:00] 
JM:  Yes. 
RS:  Uh, and they were pressuring Crown through the San Francisco community to make 
changes.  Crown never would make changes until they were forced to, but they were getting that 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 14 of 59 
 
pressure.  So, the fact that there was that input from San Francisco, uh, was important, in terms 
of – not that the movement was financed in any significant way, but if they wanted to buy 
placards for signs, there was a little kitty to do that.  And, uh, and each of these people got a trip 
to San Francisco, which they had never been out of Louisiana, and it kind of gave them a broader 
scope about what was going on and some recognition and a national location.  Uh, so, I think 
those things were unusual about Bogalusa. 
It’s a – it’s a – I can’t really compare it to a lot of other towns.  As far as my observation 
was, it was kind of the hardest line segregationist small city.  There wasn’t much leeway, uh, and 
that continues to today, as far as I’m concerned, uh, up there.  Uh, many, many years later, in the 
’90s, 1990s, after I was living in Washington and lost touch, sort of, came back, moved back, 
reconnected with my friends in Bogalusa, uh, Gayle Jenkins encouraged me to represent some 
police officers, black police officers, with their complaints about lesser treatment, discriminatory 
treatment they were getting.  And they would have been easy things to correct, but the mayor 
would not give one inch, uh, on it.  It was just remarkable that forty-five years had gone by, and 
asking for things like posting the opportunities for training so it’s not just word of mouth among 
the white officers – didn’t want to do that.  Uh, things like that – there were bigger things, too, 
but they wouldn’t do anything. 
So, Bogalusa has kind of a particular, uh, hard line about everything that I think kind of 
provoked more activity.  I assume in some other places in Louisiana when the storekeepers kind 
of got the kind of pressure they were getting in Bogalusa they would, um – you know, they were 
things like being able to try on clothes or not.  I mean, little things – it seems like little things, but 
there was never any give up there, so I think that had to do with it. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 15 of 59 
 
Alright, now, about the people.  Um, when I came back to Louisiana in the ’90s, I spent a 
lot of time talking with Gayle Jenkins.  In fact, I recorded conversations with her.  And, um, not 
that she was bragging or anything, but I got the firm impression that she was the spark that 
created an organization that, uh, uh, could take on the role the Bogalusa Voters League took on. 
She – the only thing I particularly mention is that she wanted a man to lead it.  And, uh, 
she didn’t feel – she felt it would be more effective if a man led it.  And, uh, I think she even 
mentioned a large man.  I’m not sure of that.  I may be adding that part, but I know the other part 
is true.  And there was this man, A.Z. Young, who was an outspoken, kind of well-known guy in 
the community, and she approached him and asked him to do this, according to her.  I never 
discussed this with A.Z.  And he wanted to think about it and ultimately he said he would do it.  
And when he did it, he jumped in with both feet and he did everything.  He ran around – 
And her cousin was Bob Hicks, and, uh, she encouraged him to get in, and he did, he and 
his wife both, and, uh, played a – they all played tremendously significant roles.  Uh, Hicks was 
a more, um, not so flamboyant as A.Z. Young and could get more into the details of lawsuits.  
And he became the plaintiff in a lot of the things we did.  Uh, he could testify very well and, you 
know, not, uh – and many other attributes. 
And their home on Ninth Street, which they’ve since named Robert Hicks Avenue, I 
think, uh, was the center place for anyone coming to Bogalusa in connection with civil rights.  
Uh, and it wasn’t just lawyers.  It was civil rights workers.  There was a CORE worker in town.  
Um, James Farmer came to Bogalusa.  Um, other – a man named Lincoln Lynch, I don’t know 
whether that name means anything to you, but he was the second in command in CORE, and he 
came to Bogalusa.  And everything would always happen at the Hicks house, uh, with food.  
[30:00]

Um, and it was, um – and there were these stories that a little bit precede my time, but 
about the men on the roof on the Hicks house, uh, in response to threats that he had received 
because of what he was doing.  And so, there was a show of readiness to fight back.  There were 
men on the roof with rifles, uh, and nobody came [laughs], that kind of thing.  And, uh – but 
Hicks was up for that, and he certainly never backed down for a second. 
And, uh, uh, so they all played somewhat different roles.  When it was time to give a 
speech at a big rally, A.Z. Young would give it.  And he was the front man on the marching line, 
and a lot of people – he had tremendous amount of respect in the community.  And Hicks was 
right next to him, but a little bit more subdued about things, a little bit more into the schedule, 
into what date something was going to happen, that kind of thing, if I’m making myself clear. 
JM:  Absolutely. 
RS:  And you couldn’t have one without the other.  And it was a wonderful combination.  
They all liked each other.  They didn’t fight.  No competition.  A.Z. was the president, and Bob 
was the vice-president, and Gayle was the secretary, [laughs] and never changed.  And, um, it 
was very nice.  Someone else who came to Bogalusa, uh, were the Freedom Singers and the, uh, 
Freedom Theater.  Is that what it’s called? 
JM:  Free Southern Theater? 
RS:  The Free Southern Theater came to Bogalusa, to the union hall where they had their 
meetings.  They had a performance.  The Freedom Singers came.  They had a performance.  So, 
it was attracting that kind of attention. 
JB:  Can we pause for a second?  This has been running for quite a while. 
RS:  Sure. 
JM:  Yeah. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 17 of 59 
 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re back. 
JM:  Mr. Sobol, I want to ask about, um, after arrival in ’66, um, you pursued the Crown 
Zellerbach case, obviously, and pushed it forward, and it would come to trial in summer of ’67, I 
think. 
RS:  Right. 
JM:  I think that’s when George Cooper will be in town to, uh – 
RS:  Right. 
JM:  Work that trial with you in some sense.  Can you talk about that process of pushing 
a Title VII case forward, moving it towards trial?  [JB coughs] In that moment, there’s not a lot 
of, uh – there aren’t cases.  The field is so new; the law is so new. 
RS:  Yeah.  Um, by that summer of ’67, we had filed additional cases involving other 
clients in Bogalusa, and they came to trial.  It was consolidated with a government case, United 
States v. Local 189.  Well, when I was practicing law in Washington, I was doing a lot of 
antitrust cases and I became familiar, very familiar with discovery, depositions, um, production 
of documents, which, um, the lawyers who hadn’t had that experience didn’t really have any 
familiarity with and weren’t doing.  And I got into a more methodical mode of filing the 
interrogatories, filing the requests for the production of documents, filing motions to compel 
discovery when the responses were not forthcoming, um, scheduling depositions before the 
hearing and taking them.  It would be more of a, um – one reason is I had the money to do that 
because LCDC was paying for deposition transcripts and all that kind of thing.  Uh, but I had the 
distinct impression that, uh, earlier there would be more of a rush into try to get into court a week 
afterwards and not have all the homework done. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 18 of 59 
 
Uh, that was one thing that I organized the material.  And, of course, George was a 
tremendous help.  We kind of split the issues, and he did a tremendous amount of research about 
testing and the impact of testing on fair employment.  And that was a new issue at that time.  
People really hadn’t been talking about that.  And he got a lot of experts, uh, to help him, people 
in – not lawyers, but people in the testing field.  So, that was one major advantage. 
Another was, um, there was a new judge just appointed named Frederick Heebe, uh, who 
had nothing in his background that would suggest he’d be sympathetic to these kinds of cases, 
but he was sympathetic to these kinds of cases.  And, um, a lot of the cases, a lot of the litigation 
in Bogalusa went before Judge Heebe, uh, not because of any special tricks.  It just fell that way.  
He had the school case.  He had both – he had all three [35:00] employment discrimination 
cases, um, other cases. 
There was a school – the school cases in Bogalusa, see, they went further than any other 
school cases, because they wanted to litigate about who’d be the prom queen and, uh, uh, how 
the football players are being treated and every last thing.  The people in Bogalusa would not 
accept what they call in the law “one vestige of discrimination.”  I think they wanted to get 
everything out on the table.  And Judge Heebe would call a hearing – I remember we had a two-
day hearing on a Friday and Saturday about the selection of the prom queen.  And he treated it as 
serious as any other case he could have had, and it was very wonderful really.  Because, you 
know, another judge could just throw you out or not schedule it.  I mean it’s – you don’t get to 
trial because you want to get to trial; you get to trial because the judge says, “Okay, here’s the 
trial date.” 
And, um, so we got a lot of cooperation from this man.  See, the courts were so different 
then.  Not only from Heebe, and he’s not the only district judge that helped us out a lot, but the 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 19 of 59 
 
Court of Appeals was just perfect, [laughs] in terms of what we wanted to do.  They were these 
men who really cared about these things and would give you, like I mentioned before about the 
school case in St. Francisville, they’d give you what you were entitled to overnight, um, and so 
all those things coalesced.  I didn’t have to do that when – in the Heebe cases, but, uh, in other 
cases I certainly did.  So, um, I attribute it more to those factors than anything else. 
The, uh – some of the issues in the Crown Zellerbach case were perfectly obvious.  The 
seniority issues and the testing issues were not, and I mentioned George developed one, and I 
worked on the other.  And I got help from – there was a case in Virginia called Quarles v. Philip 
Morris that was a precedent, and I think the first case, really. 
JM:  ’68, yeah. 
RS:  ’68?  Was that later? 
JM:  ’68, yeah, it was that late.  Well, it would have been tried before then. 
RS:  Then it wasn’t a precedent.  I thought there was a precedent in that case.  Maybe it 
came later as a precedent in some of our – 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  Alright, so – 
JM:  Judge Butzner. 
RS:  Yeah.  And a woman named Gabriel [Kirk] MacDonald, who later became a federal 
judge in Texas, uh, was a lawyer, uh, for the plaintiffs.  Um, in addition, I began – you 
mentioned whether I was consulting with the Lawyers Defense, Legal Defense Fund, which I 
wasn’t, but I did become, uh, in contact with the lawyers from the Civil Rights Division of the 
Department of Justice.  And they were doing a lot of thinking about these seniority issues and 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 20 of 59 
 
really showed me some things I hadn’t realized myself about them, one guy particularly, named 
Robert Moore, and David Rose. 
And we tried the Local 189 case together, uh, but even before that – the Hicks case 
[Hicks v. Crown Zellerbach] was tried first – I was getting kind of different vantage points on 
how the seniority system can adversely affect black employees who had never been allowed in 
white jobs.  Need I say, before the Civil Rights Act was passed, there were black jobs and white 
jobs – there was no two ways about it; there was no fooling – and two unions, and each union 
had its own jobs in their contract.  And the question is how you put that together, and it’s 
complicated.  And, uh, um, anyway, by the time we went to trial, I had it straight.  And Judge 
Heebe bought it and issued a preliminary – he didn’t issue his written opinion until three years 
later, but he issued an injunction at the end of the trial.  And, uh, so I guess that’s the answer to 
your question. 
JM:  Um-hmm.  Let me take you back up to Bogalusa and have you talk a little bit – 
you’re grappling up there with, and the Voters League is grappling with the most basic things, 
education, jobs.  Um, can you talk a little bit more about the – some illustrative detail about the 
nature, kind of for our record here, what you saw in the schools, what you saw at Crown 
Zellerbach, a little bit more of the fabric of that experience for those folks at the time? 
RS:  Okay.  Um, when, we used to say, a desegregation order had been issued in the 
Southern school desegregation cases, it was the most token – the result was as token as it could 
possibly be.  It was what was called then “freedom of choice.”  And every white student chose a 
white school, and two or three or four black kids, pushed by their parents, basically, would go to 
the white school, and all the other black children [40:00] would go to the same school they were 
going to. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 21 of 59 
 
So, I had occasion to visit, even after there was a desegregation order in Bogalusa, the 
schools, and they were blatantly rundown.  I mean they didn’t look anything like the white 
schools looked.  And, uh, I interviewed teachers and I heard about how they were paid less and, 
uh, didn’t get the supplies they needed.  And, uh, uh, and you could just walk by the school and 
see what was, you know, see what the building looked like.  They were dilapidated. 
And, um – and that motivated our office to, to really press that particular issue, which is 
one of the things I spent a lot of time working on, which was eliminating freedom of choice and 
reestablishing the school districts in some kind of nonracial way that everybody goes to the 
school near their house.  And, uh, the first place that was ordered, I think, in the South was in 
Washington Parish by Judge Heebe.  Um, I’ve got the citation of the case in that material I gave 
you. 
Um, and then later on we achieved similar relief in the Supreme Court of the United 
States on a south-wide, on a whole regional basis, that it had to happen right away, it couldn’t be 
– there was no more deliberate speed.  Those are very important issues, because the status of 
school desegregation, as I found it when I got to the South – I’m not saying about the big cities; I 
never was in a big city case, like New Orleans – but in these small towns, it amounted just little 
next to nothing. 
Uh, and, of course, the children who had to do this, uh – I’m just reading Charlene 
Hunter’s book about her going to the University of Georgia [laughs] – and the children that had 
to do this had to put up with quite a bit.  It wasn’t just going to school anymore.  It was these 
eight and nine-year-olds being these heroes, and that’s not fair.  And, um – anyway, so that was 
the school situation.  By the time I left my job at LCDC, there still was no significant integration 
of the schools in Bogalusa.  It happened the following year. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 22 of 59 
 
Um, with respect to the paper mill, uh, of course, I got familiar with the men.  I became 
the lawyer for the black union.  Uh, I was able to tour the plant and, um, see the jobs.  And, of 
course, a lot of the defense about these seniority issues was that the, uh, the black employees 
weren’t competent to do, hadn’t been trained.  They wanted everybody to go up step-by-step and 
take – get at the back of the line, essentially, and learn.  But some of these men were fifty and 
fifty-five years old, and they didn’t have any time to get at the back of the line. 
Uh, and I began to observe the jobs, and they were, uh, with very few exceptions, quite 
simple jobs.  The, uh – and I could see by just watching them what the men were doing – I was 
in there by court order to view the plant – that anything complicated, like fixing a broken 
machine, they’d call in a craftsman who was specializing in that machine.  But in terms of a 
working machine, the production of corrugated board is a very simple process.  It’s a repetitive 
process.  And, uh, it might take – you know, I’ve always been cynical about the amount of 
training you need for things.  I would say in two or three days, maximum, any reasonably 
intelligent person could have done any of those jobs.  They wanted them to wait twenty-five 
years.  Uh, so, I saw what it was on the ground, and that, of course, encouraged me, because I 
didn’t know anything about making paper.  [Laughs] That encouraged me to, uh – in my legal 
pursuits by seeing what was actually involved in these jobs. 
And, of course, the pay scales were dramatically different.  Uh, the highest paying black 
job under the pre-Title VII union contract was picking the final product off the assembly line and 
putting it on pallets.  And that was the highest paying job.  There were sweeping the floor jobs.  
There were lesser jobs.  And the white jobs started a notch above that job and would go up six or 
seven steps to what was really good blue-collar pay at that time. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 23 of 59 
 
So, um, um, and that got into, kind of slid into a sex discrimination issue, because they 
wouldn’t – there was a box plant, two bag plants, making two different types of paper bags, and 
a paper mill, which takes wood and turns it into paper.  The bag plants, uh, were all white and no 
[45:00] – I’m trying to – I forget – there were no women in the box plant?  There was an aspect 
of sex discrimination about the bag plants that slips my mind right now.  But, uh, they had a – 
oh, I know what it was!  I know what it was.  They didn’t employ women at all, regardless of 
race, in the box plant and the paper mill, but they employed them in the bag plant.  And in the 
bag plant, there were no black employees at all – the bag plants, plural.  And so, it kind of 
became a combination of sex and race.  And, uh, I noticed that, touring the plant, that there were 
no black employees.  And, see, they had a separate black union for the box plant and a separate 
one for the paper mill, but no black union, of course, for the other ones, because there were no 
black employees. 
So, a lot of being able to get in there and be on the scene – and, as I said before about 
Bogalusa, I had clients in upstate New York and in Tallulah, Louisiana, which is as high as you 
can go and still be in Louisiana.  I had clients in Monroe and, um [speaking to Anne Sobol] 
what’s that pretty town where Stanley lives to the west of here? 
Anne Sobol:  Lafayette. 
RS:  Lafayette.  Um, but I didn’t get over there.  There had to be an event for me to go 
that far.  [Laughter] But Bogalusa, I was there all the time.  So, uh, it was very – you get a deeper 
understanding of what’s going on. 
JM:  Did you typically go up and back in a day or – dependent on what you had to do? 
RS:  Oh, sure. 
JM:  Yeah. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 24 of 59 
 
RS:  I never slept in Bogalusa. 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  [Laughs] I made a – I made a rule of thumb not to sleep in those places, because, I 
guess, that was my fear of violence, uh, that I just didn’t want to be asleep in one of the motels in 
these towns.  I would go to Faraday, Louisiana, which was another civil rights hotspot, and I’d 
cross the bridge into Mississippi and stay in Natchez.  And when I went to Tallulah, I would 
cross the bridge and stay in Vicksburg, uh, because I just always had a feeling it wouldn’t be a 
good idea to be sleeping alone in one of these motels. 
Um, so I never stayed in Bogalusa.  There was no reason to, actually.  It was about ninety 
minutes.  But they would, um, at least in the early stages, [laughs] they would drive me to the 
border of Washington Parish [laughs], uh, to see me out.  And I never knew whether that was – I 
never really – I don’t know if that was necessary or not necessary.  The fact is I never had any 
problem, uh, and it may be because they were driving me.  But, uh, I always came home. 
JM:  Yeah.  Let me ask you, on that theme of risk and violence and all, Bogalusa 
obviously has a pretty active chapter of the Deacons for Defense, and I’m wondering what you – 
RS:  Are you saying now they do? 
JM:  No.  Then they did. 
RS:  Then. 
JM:  And I’m wondering your perspective on the implications of the Deacons in the 
community and, um, say, in relation to the civil rights activities of the Voters League and – 
RS:  Well, okay.  I have a rather unorthodox view about the Deacons of Defense.  In the 
time I was living here and working on problems in Bogalusa, uh, I never heard about the 
Deacons of Defense.  I, uh – “never” maybe overstates it.  Maybe I heard about it, but there were 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 25 of 59 
 
certainly no members to meet – “This is the guy from the Deacons” – everything was under the 
Bogalusa Voters League.  I did know about how, when there were some threats of violence 
against the Hicks household, friends of theirs came and climbed on the roof and spent the night 
with rifles.  Now, that gets to be a Deacons of Defense story.  At the time, I think it was friends 
of the Hicks, coming over there with their rifles.  So, I just don’t – I think there’s something 
about the Deacons story that’s very attractive to historians, if you don’t mind my saying that, 
[laughter] because I hear so much about it now and I heard nothing about it then.  And I’ve 
spoken with Lolis Elie about this extensively, and he agrees with me. 
JM:  Interesting. 
RS:  Um, uh, so, I don’t know.  I am not – that’s really what I have to say about it.  Uh, 
uh, I did, like I say, when I left town, not for long, but in the early days, in ’65 and maybe the 
first few months of ’65, somebody would want to follow me down in a car, down to the border.  
But the word “deacon” was never mentioned, and I don’t even think I saw any guns.  I didn’t see 
any guns.  Um, I never saw any guns, actually, when you get right down to it.  Uh, so I read these 
stories about people had their trunk full of rifles.  I just don’t know – I don’t know what this is all 
about.  Maybe I was just naïve. [50:00] But that’s my honest thing I can tell you.  [Laughter] 
That’s my impression. 
JM:  Did you have much of a sense –? 
RS:  Uh. 
JM:  I’m sorry. 
RS:  Okay. 
JM:  Did you have any sense, much of a sense of the Klan? 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 26 of 59 
 
RS:  Yes.  Um, I think there were some Klan – some Klan violence against some of the 
marchers.  I’m a little indistinct about it in my mind, but, um, I think there was.  Um, and I don’t 
know who could tell you now exactly who was there, because the main people aren’t around 
right now.  But I don’t think it was massive in any way.  I mean, it was bad.  I think there were 
one or two occasions where a shot was fired during a march, and somebody was hurt.  But I’m 
just not that clear.  It didn’t happen when I was around. 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  Um, see, because the Bogalusa movement was way underway long before I got here. 
JM:  Exactly. 
RS:  And some of the most important things that were going to happen had already 
happened.  Uh, Hicks v. Knight – are you familiar with that case?  Uh, I had nothing to do with 
whatsoever.  It was concluded the day before I arrived as a volunteer.  But it had been Robert 
Hicks and several others taking on the chief of police because of lack of protection of marchers, 
which certainly means to me there must have been some harassing of marchers.  So, I’m just not 
a good source for this.  Because, as I say, Judge [Herbert] Christenberry, a very powerful man, 
[laughs] put an injunction in against every police officer in town, and, um, I didn’t see that kind 
of activity.  I – I just didn’t see it.  So, I don’t really want to talk too much about it, because I 
don’t know much about it, really, but that’s just my impressions of it.  But I do think there was 
violence. 
And when we marched to, uh, Baton Rouge, which was entering new territory, the word 
was out that the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan is in Livingston Parish, and there was a lot of 
discussion, and I was engaged in negotiations with state officers about were they going to let 
them march through Livingston Parish, although it’s right on the way to Baton Rouge – but I 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 27 of 59 
 
suppose some other route could have been found – but because they felt there was going to be 
really violence, serious violence, in Livingston Parish. 
And I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the picture of the march going through Livingston 
Parish, but there were troopers lined up on each side of the marchers, forming a, uh, a barrier 
between the marchers and the observers.  And, uh, um, when it came, push came to shove, with – 
and the guardsmen who were there, I guess that’s what they were, National Guardsmen, way 
outnumbered the marchers.  So, they were really being protected.  And the only thing I actually 
saw was some soda bottles being, some glass soda bottles being thrown above the police to land 
in the area where the marchers were.  But they had cleared the area of anybody that was going to 
– had a gun or anything like that. 
So, that was kind of a scary thing, um, but it didn’t come to fruition in any serious way.  
But we were thinking that the Klan was in Livingston Parish, um, although undoubtedly there 
were people – you know, organizations like the Klan and the Deacons, they’re kind of murky.  
It’s not like belonging to the ACLU.  It’s an attitude more than anything else, and they certainly 
had the attitude in Bogalusa, but I just didn’t see much of it. 
JM:  Let’s take a little pause and – 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re cooking again. 
JM:  Stop for just a sec, John. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
RS:  [Clears throat] Am I plugged back in? 
JM:  You are. 
RS:  Yeah, okay. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 28 of 59 
 
JB:  Okay. 
JM:  We’re back after just a brief break.  Mr. Sobol, I’d like to take you back, turn again 
to the Hicks v. Crown Zellbacher trial before Judge Heebe in summer of ’67. 
RS:  Okay. 
JM:  Any – you’ve said some things about the judge, very interesting perspective.  Uh, he 
emerged in the end as someone who you were happy to be in front of. 
RS:  Yes, definitely. 
JM:  Thoughts about the trial, special recollections or impressions, memories that persist? 
RS:  Um, it was, um – there were two issues that were really being litigated, the seniority 
issue and the testing issue.  And George showed – and each side had witnesses.  And George 
showed up, George Cooper showed up at the trial with a trunk, and I’m talking about the kind of 
trunk a kid would take to camp, a big trunk, full of books that he had found that either the 
witnesses for Crown Zellerbach had said the opposite things than what they were saying now, or 
other experts [laughs] demolishing what they were saying.  And he walked in the court, he 
opened the trunk, and he piled all these books on the counsel tables sort of like a library.  It was 
all a row of books, [55:00] all over. 
And each witness for Crown – I’m telling you the highlights in my mind – [laughter] 
George would start in with the first book, and he’d go through every book with them.  And, um, 
he just made them look like complete idiots.  Uh, and what seemed like a tough road to hoe, 
because the test had nothing about race in it – you know how these tests are – uh, by this process, 
uh, he really made it clear to the judge, who was open to having it made clear to him, what the 
impact of these tests were and how useless they were for the purpose they were intended, which 
is to find good employees. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 29 of 59 
 
Um, we had our witnesses, too, on that issue, which George had found and brought to 
New Orleans and testified, and Crown had theirs, but it was the cross examination that sticks out 
in my mind.  And, um, on the testing issue, or on the seniority issue, it was a little less dramatic, 
uh, but we did have charts, and we had made charts to display in a way the judge could see it 
from the bench what would be the impact of the existing seniority system versus one that did not 
incorporate the past.  And, um, um, went on for quite a while, the trial did.  I would guess it was 
something like eight days of trial, and with a lot of attendance from the people in Bogalusa, 
particularly the Crown Zellerbach workers. 
Bob Hicks was sitting next to me the entire eight days.  Uh, that’s what I meant by – 
that’s the kind of thing he could do.  He’d keep the record straight.  [Laughs] He’d help me with 
doing it.  And, um, um, and the judge, I think, was impressed by that.  I think he was – this man 
was changed.  The judge was changed by his exposure to these civil rights cases.  Um, and I 
think one of them was the, um – you know, there’s a lot of feeling sometimes by a judge that the 
lawyers are ginning up the cases or making up the theories, and there really is no client, it’s just a 
name.  But by virtue of having thirty people from Crown Zellerbach in the courtroom, uh, 
completely, you know, got rid of any of that flavor, and it really became what it was, which was 
a community that was committed to this. 
Um, and that was not just in that case, but in a lot of other cases before Judge Heebe.  
And, like I said, he had the school case, and a lot of kids came down to be there for it.  And, uh, 
that was another thing about the movement in Bogalusa.  They responded to that kind of 
situation.  They would do that.  That’s really all my thoughts are about the case. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, obviously, it’s so known to you and into the record that sometimes we 
pass right over it, but for our purpose today, could you just recap in brief terms the introduction 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 30 of 59 
 
of things like the Wonderlic [Personnel] Test and how they were employed and why it became 
something that had to be fought against? 
RS:  The Wonderlic Test is a short short-answer test, maybe twenty questions, thirty 
questions at most, which tested, um, very simple forms of knowledge, um, including definitions 
of words, um, knowledge of maybe geography, um, uh, spatial relation things.  And it had been 
used – it was a device that had been used for years, uh, around the country as some kind of 
minimal intelligence to get a job thing when there was no issue about race involved.  Crown 
Zellerbach didn’t adopt that test until the Civil Rights Act passed, so none of these white workers 
in these supposedly difficult jobs had ever passed the test.  Uh, and they made it a requirement 
for employment; white or black, you had to pass the test. 
Well, the statistics showed – well, they showed two things.  One is that, uh, the – 
historically and in Bogalusa, the white pass-rate was much higher than the black pass-rate.  
Three things it showed.  Secondly, that there was – the concept of job relatedness came into 
being at that time, that it would be legal if it was job related.  So, if you tested an electrician on 
how do you set up a 220-volt socket, that would be a job related test, but that all [1:00:00] 
evidence that could be obtained found that, um, there was no job relatedness to this test, um, that 
you could not predict from the test how anybody would perform on the job in a paper mill. 
And, um, that’s become common wisdom now, and the EEOC [Equal Employment 
Opportunities Commission] ultimately issued guidelines on the issue, and the Office of Contract 
Compliance at the Department of Labor issued guidelines, and now employers are very sensitive 
about, are very careful about using tests.  But the result of them was that, um, eight out of ten 
black employees were disqualified in the first half-hour they were in the employment office, and 
not so for whites.  And the culture – and then, the science leads into cultural factors.  One of the 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 31 of 59 
 
classic questions on the test, which I’ll just use as an example because it’s such a good one, is, 
“What does RSVP mean?”  Um, well, it turned out these black kids didn’t know about RSVP.  
And that’s a kind of symbolic question, but not isolated in its context and its meaning.  And, um, 
that was something that was just bound to fall.  And, uh, I did a lot of litigation in other cases in 
Washington, D.C., and elsewhere about these test things because there were different quirks that 
would come up, but the Wonderlic Test was like a sitting duck because it had nothing to do with 
the work involved. 
JM:  Let me also ask you on the seniority side, you alluded briefly a few minutes ago to a 
very complicated question that you worked very, very hard to argue your way through, and that’s 
the question of, “How does the law grapple with the legacy effects of pre-Act segregation, 
insofar as it reaches the seniority question?” 
RS:  Do you want me to explain it, the problem? 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  Okay.  I’ll give you two examples.  The, uh – when Crown Zellerbach merged the 
progression lines, which they did voluntarily, you might say.  They were under pressure from the 
EEOC, but they did it early on.  They couldn’t maintain jobs with racial labels on them after the 
Civil Rights Act.  They merged them by pay, so that the white line may have been $3 dollars an 
hour, $3.50, $4.00, $4.50, $5 dollars.  And the black line would be $1.75, $2, $2.50, $2.75.  I’m 
making up those numbers.  And they put them together, so as a result of putting them together 
based on their wage discrimination, they had all the black jobs at the bottom, and all the white 
jobs at the top. 
And they had a system of job seniority – didn’t matter how long you had worked in the 
plant.  The only thing that mattered was how long you had worked in the next line down in the 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 32 of 59 
 
line of progression when there was a vacancy.  So, if there was a vacancy in the very top job, 
they would look into the second top job and they would see who was in that second top job the 
longest.  Well, you can see the ramifications of that.  Um, the only job any black man could enter 
was the lowest rating white job, and then he’d be the junior guy in that job.  And there may be 
fifteen people in that job, and it would take fifteen different promotions before he would be able 
to move into the next job. 
So, um, the most basic thing we wanted and presented was that the seniority positions 
should be filled based on plant seniority, um, how long you worked for Crown Zellerbach.  So 
that when a job opened, uh, and there were more than one – people would sign a bid sheet to bid 
on the job, that the senior employee on a plant-wide basis would be given first consideration, and 
if he was qualified to do the job, he would get it.  So, that was very simple.  Of course, the 
defense had to do with qualifications and how many years it would take to learn how to mix the 
glue, you know, um, so all these orders had reservations in them about qualifications, but they 
were carefully restricted – the qualifications thing. 
And then came the, um, notion of having to go through every job on the way to the top, 
which had always been the system.  And they argued it’s a nonracial system, we’ve always done 
this, you move from job 5 to 4 to 3.  So, that although a black employee based on plant seniority 
could go into the lowest ranking white job, uh, he couldn’t go into any other job without first 
serving in the lowest ranking job.  And this is [1:05:00] where the lawyers from the Department 
of Justice were really inspiring to me, I must say, that they should be allowed to go into any job 
that becomes open as long as they can do the job.  And, um, so it wasn’t just moving from job 
seniority to plant seniority, it was essentially eliminating the line of progression. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 33 of 59 
 
Uh, that’s a thumbnail of the basic points.  And, uh, it would have different tricks and 
turns, because the lines would sometimes go in two different directions halfway up, and you’d 
have to account for that some way or other.  But those were the two things: getting rid of plant 
seniority and getting rid of the lines of progression.  And they fought like hell about it.  And the 
unions, uh, did as well initially.  They turned around.  But initially they did as well, because 
there was something, you know, sacred in the contract.  In fact, defenses were raised fairly early 
in Title VII that if it’s in the collective bargaining agreement, it can’t be illegal.  And so, that was 
another hurdle you had to overcome – the contract was illegal itself.  And, um, so those were the 
kinds of issues that were involved. 
JM:  Yeah.  You and George [Sobol] wrote what would become an absolutely critical 
piece in the Harvard Law Review, published in ’69, on these questions and would have so much 
influence on how courts grapple with these things, including through [Griggs] and etcetera.  And 
I’m very interested in your perspective on both kind of how you labored to construct that piece, 
and, um, the challenges you found in front of you in crafting the arguments – they had been the 
ones you had been working on, obviously, in the active litigation – and your sense of the impact 
of that piece. 
RS:  Uh, I want to go back and give you my second example on the preceding question. 
JM:  Sure, please. 
RS:  That’s going to feed into what you’re saying. 
JM:  Please. 
RS:  Another situation was where no blacks were hired at all, and that was true in the 
New Orleans transit system.  Every bus driver, every trolley driver in town was white.  And 
when the Civil Rights Act passed, uh, they began to hire black employees and they had a system 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 34 of 59 
 
of company-wide seniority.  The one we were fighting for in Bogalusa, they already had it.  But 
the black employees didn’t have it, and as a result, uh, they would get all the, um, Saturday night 
shifts and overtime and late at night and not the good jobs. 
Uh, and we had a case against New Orleans Public Service, Fagan v. NOPSI [New 
Orleans Public Service, Inc.], in which – also before Judge Heebe, in which, um, he required the 
assignment – as a remedy, he required the assignment of job assignments by random, by lottery.  
That’s a completely different remedy, uh, because they all could drive the bus.  It’s just a 
question of which bus, what time of day you’re driving the bus.  So, it had to do with a situation 
where the vestige of past discrimination is not a segregated system, like in Bogalusa, but no 
black employees at all, and what happens when you get in. 
Um, okay, um, the article.  This theory – I don’t want to get too technical on you, but 
there’s a provision in Title VII that protects nondiscriminatory seniority systems.  And the 
people defending the status quo would always say, “It has to be nondiscriminatory.  It was 
created before there was any black competition for these jobs.”  Our position was it was 
discriminatory because of the impact it had on the black employees, and the position that we 
argued soon became, uh, widely accepted in the intermediate federal courts.  And the article that 
we wrote, I think, contributed to that, um, uh, although I must say it was well underway by 1969, 
but I think it contributed to that.  Um, the way we wrote it, uh, was a little more scholarly than 
the brief, so the arguments in court, but essentially was along the same lines. 
And George and I were old friends.  It wasn’t like we were strangers came together for 
this.  We – we had tried Hicks together, but before that we were friends in Washington when I 
was working.  He was at Covington & Burling, and I was at Arnold & Porter, and we lived in the 
same neighborhood and we were friends.  And, um, he came down here because I asked him to, 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 35 of 59 
 
and that kind of thing.  So, uh, it was a very – more than collegial.  We were old friends, writing 
this thing.  And I wrote half, he wrote half.  He edited my half, I edited his half.  And [1:10:00] 
we sent it to the Harvard Law Review.  They edited the whole thing.  They rearranged it 
completely, they put the end at the beginning, uh, [laughter] and that’s how it got published.  But 
it came out at a key time, and it was in the Harvard Law Review, and a lot of people read it.  
George once told me that he had gotten a notification from some group that it was the most cited 
law review article in many years. 
But the Supreme Court had yet to be heard from.  And, to make a long story short, when 
it got to the Supreme Court, they ruled with what the employers’ position on this, that the system 
was not discriminatory if it wasn’t adopted with the purpose of injuring or hampering black or 
minority employment, in a case involving. I think, United States v. Teamsters in 1976, maybe, 
’75.  So, we had a good run because for, um – from 1967 until 1965 or ’66 – 
JM:  No, ’75. 
RS:  Oh, sorry. 1967 until 1975 or ’76, everybody was doing what we were advocating, 
including the Department of Labor in the contract compliance field.  Are you familiar with that?  
Uh, so it was almost – the job was almost done.  The Supreme Court comes along and says, “No.  
It was – it should never have happened.”  Uh, so that was a big kind of intellectual 
disappointment.  But I really do feel the job had been done, uh, in that instance, and, uh, and I 
did feel that we contributed to that. 
One thing I want to say about it is when I went to Washington – see, I worked in – uh, I 
was at Michigan for one semester.  I didn’t want to stay as a professor, came to Washington and 
got back into civil rights through the civil rights – Washington Research Project.  But then I went 
into private practice.  And, uh, what I was getting into, finding ways to make money, was 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 36 of 59 
 
representing unions in – one thing we developed was the right of a union to bring a Title VII 
case, and, uh, I was working for unions in doing that.  I’m skipping way ahead now.  But the 
people who were the power – the power-that-be people in the Washington union establishment 
still held it against me because of that article, [laughs] and they were very resentful at first.  And 
I had a lot of headwind about that, in terms of becoming a lawyer for unions, because I had done 
this kind of traitorous thing.  Uh, that was the major personal manifestation that came out of it, 
and some people still feel that way about it. 
The point they were making is: If you’re being a lawyer, you should be a lawyer.  If 
you’re going to be a scholar, you should be a scholar.  But you shouldn’t mix them, [phone or 
doorbell rings] because it, um, pollutes the objectivity of the scholarly endeavor.  And, the truth 
is, I wrote that article the same way I handle civil rights cases.  I wrote that article to advance 
civil rights.  I wasn’t really trying to be a scholar, uh, although it reads that way.  And so, there 
was some, I guess, some merit in what they were saying.  But that was an outgrowth for me.  The 
guy who was the chief guy at the AFL-CIO, for example, didn’t want to hear about me.  
[Laughter]  Uh, so, um. 
JM:  Can we pause again here just for a sec? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
Elaine Nichols:  [1:13:29] your thought – you continue to mention the importance of 
these judges in influencing these cases.  And it seems to be that that was the case throughout the 
South, as well. 
RS:  Throughout the country. 
EN:  Yeah. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 37 of 59 
 
RS:  Listen, this week five justices of the Supreme Court think it’s cruel and unusual 
punishment to keep these prisoners in California cooped up in these little booths, and four think 
it’s not.  Well, that just tells you the whole story.  It’s all what – it’s all how the judge feels.  It’s 
all – law falls away when you get down to those kinds of decisions.  It’s just how – well, who’s 
the person?  And it happens every day, all over the country, constantly, uh, and it happened here.  
And it’s happening now.  You can’t do a thing in civil rights in the courts in New Orleans, in the 
federal courts, right now.  Every judge on the District Court and the Court of Appeals, they’re all 
bad. 
AS:  [1:14:33] 
RS:  You’re thinking of –? 
AS:  [1:14:38] 
RS:  Oh, I don’t know.  Anyway, maybe I’m wrong about every judge.  But certainly you 
can’t do the kinds of things we were doing then.  They had open arms for us.  They were – I went 
to judges’ houses on weekends.  They’d welcome you in.  I spent July Fourth, uh, 1967, in Judge 
Christenberry’s home in the French Quarter.  And he was on the phone, telling the people 
[1:15:00] in Bogalusa if he didn’t let those people out of jail in twenty minutes, he was going to 
have the U.S. Marshall force up there and arrest them!  Yeah, it was all – it was all that.  And for 
a lot of times, I felt I was just kind of setting the table so these guys could do what they, what 
they felt they should do. 
And, uh, and if you got the wrong thing, like the guy in Baton Rouge, there was nothing 
you could tell them.  You could cite cases all day long, and they wouldn’t care.  I mean it’s, uh – 
it’s, uh – I feel that very strongly.  That’s one of the reasons why I don’t – I’m not that interested 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 38 of 59 
 
in law anymore.  Because it’s so obvious to me that [laughs] what we’re doing is just – it’s kind 
of political, you might say. 
Anne Sobol:  Some of the Title VII cases that Richard handled, um, lasted for years.  Nils 
Douglas started the case about Kaiser Aluminum plant, and by the time that case was finished 
and had gone up through the Appellate Courts and to the Supreme Court and back, the relief was 
handed down, was given out, seventeen years after they began.  So. 
RS:  That’s another problem. 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  One of those cases lasted so long the plant closed down, uh, but they still had to pay 
out millions of dollars for what they had done.  And, um, okay. 
JM:  Yeah. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re rolling. 
JM:  Okay, let me – let me turn your memory back to a very unusual episode in ’67 when 
you end up in jail, and it involves Leander Perez.  And I’m sure that, um – I’m sure that that’s 
enough to cue you for a very interesting story. 
RS:  Well, in the, um, early 1967, January or February, Gary Duncan, a man named Gary 
Duncan and his mother – Gary was nineteen years old at the time – and his mother came to my 
office.  They had been sent there by, uh, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, 
which had an office in New Orleans.  They had gone there for help, and they couldn’t handle 
criminal cases, defend criminal cases, and they sent them to me.  And, uh, what happened was 
this young man had, uh – well, I’ll give you a little bit of background.  Leander Perez fought like 
no one ever before had fought against desegregating the public schools in the parish that he – 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 39 of 59 
 
JM:  Tell us who he was, I’m sorry. 
RS:  Leander Perez was a well-known racist figure, uh, who espoused theories of 
interposition and, uh, secession and, uh, um, barring the schoolhouse door.  And he appeared 
before Congress and he said these things.  And he said at one point, “If any civil rights activist 
ever comes to Plaquemines Parish, we have a special place for him on Prince Philip Island with 
the alligators.”  But no one had ever come down and no one had ever done that.  In fact, the 
reason the government – the government brought the school desegregation case, and the reason 
is that it was the only place in Louisiana that nobody would be the plaintiff, would stand up and 
be the plaintiff, because of the intimidation that this man had created about civil rights. 
Uh, his son was the district attorney.  He appointed the judges.  He was the head of the 
Parish Council, which is the governing body down there, uh, the older man was – he appointed 
the judges.  Um, so, um, Judge Christenberry, uh, heard the case, put an injunction in effect 
requiring certain desegregation.  And by that time, it was so – things had passed to the point that 
he actually entered an order that achieved some desegregation on a more-than-token basis in 
Plaquemines Parish, and there was a lot of furor down there about this. 
And Duncan was driving his truck down the only highway there is on the west side of the 
Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish, and he came to the school.  And he saw that two of his 
nephews were being encountered by four white boys on the side of the road and he could see a 
fight was developing.  He got out of the truck, he asked what was going on, and one of his 
cousins said, “They’re giving us a problem.”  And he said, “Well, get in the truck.”  And he, at 
this point – he’s a very sweet guy, Duncan – he touched one of the boys on the elbow and he 
said, “Now, go ahead on.”  Well, the father of one of the boys was within eyesight of this, and he 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 40 of 59 
 
reported that Duncan had slapped his son.  And, uh, that night Duncan was arrested and charged 
with, uh, with battery, a criminal charge punishable by two years in jail. 
And, God bless him, he [1:20:00] wasn’t going to accept that.  [Laughs] And he – like I 
say, he and his mother went to the Department of Justice.  They sent him to me.  I agreed to 
represent him with Collins, Douglas & Elie.  We all agreed to represent him and, um, we began 
to represent him.  And, um, we represented him – we didn’t just raise civil rights issues in cases.  
When we’re representing somebody, we represent – like any lawyer, we raised every issue you 
possibly could to help your client. 
One of them was the, uh, Louisiana jury system at the time, which did not allow for juries 
in any case unless the punishment was more than two years.  So, he was going to be tried before 
this judge that Perez had appointed.  So, um, I filed a motion to challenge that system, whatever 
the motion was exactly called, but to question the constitutionality of the lack of jury trial.  It was 
denied.  Um, we tried the case.  I had my witnesses; they had their witnesses.  Um, the judge 
ruled for the state and sentenced Duncan to prison, actually sixty days in prison, um, and a fine. 
And, um, I was intent on appealing, particularly on the jury issue, because the law in the 
Supreme Court was developing that more and more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights were 
going to be applicable in state criminal proceedings.  In fact, I mentioned before Abe Fortas had 
just won that for counsel, a right to counsel.  So, I went to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  So, I 
needed to go to the Supreme Court of Louisiana to exhaust my remedies and then apply writs to 
the Supreme Court.  And, uh, I went down after the – so, I did that.  I got – I kept him out of jail 
until the Supreme Court of Louisiana acted on it.  Uh, they issued a one-sentence order saying, 
“No violation,” and they recited what the statute said. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 41 of 59 
 
And I went down again to get a stay of execution of the sentence until I filed the petition 
to the Supreme Court.  And I went to the judge’s office.  I called ahead and made an 
appointment.  He knew I was coming.  I went down there.  He signed the stay to keep Duncan 
out of jail until – and as I walked out, Leander Perez and the sheriff were standing there in the 
hall and arrested me.  Uh, and the charge was practicing law without a license, um, which in fact 
I didn’t have a Louisiana license.  I was a lawyer temporarily in the state, [laughs] acting with 
local counsel.  That’s my legal position. 
So, they put me in jail and, uh, I got one phone call and I made it to my colleagues in 
New Orleans.  And Don Juneau came down and bailed me out before the afternoon was out.  
Um, and I was in the jail with the white prisoners.  [Laughs] They were holding me with the 
white prisoners.  And some guy started telling me the story about another LCDC lawyer I knew 
was an LCDC lawyer in Alabama who had been arrested for the same reason, [laughing] and 
he’s saying, “Can you imagine?  He’s representing these niggers, and they got his ass!”  So, and 
I’m saying, “Oh, really?  Really?  Is that right?”  [Laughter] Uh, but, uh, Juneau got me out. 
And, uh, we consulted with my – other people involved with my situation down there, 
and we filed a case to, uh, enjoin my prosecution and to declare the, uh, any prohibition on the 
activities of outside civil rights lawyers unconstitutional, is violating not only the lawyer’s rights 
but the individual’s rights to counsel.  And, uh, that became a, uh – that got blown up.  So, the 
case was assigned to Judge Cassibry.  Because of the constitutionality of a state law involved, 
uh, a three-judge court was assembled, which included Judge Heebe, my friend, and Judge 
Ainsworth, a member of the Court of Appeals. 
And, uh, there was discovery and then there was a trial.  And the trial lasted for three 
weeks, and every day there was a story in the [New Orleans] Times-Picayune about what was 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 42 of 59 
 
going on in the courtroom.  And essentially, it took just a few minutes of an hour or so, to 
describe what I just said to you, what the facts were.  It all turned out to be like a congressional 
committee hearing on the state of law practice in Louisiana.  And lawyers were coming in from 
all over the state, both brought in – oh, the government intervened on our side.  It was me and 
Duncan, were the plaintiffs, and the head of CORE, Isaac Reynolds at that time, were the 
plaintiffs.  And then, the government became a plaintiff intervener.  And the defendant was 
Perez, and the state of Louisiana intervened on the side of Perez.  [1:25:00] And the state bar 
association intervened on the side of Perez.  So, there were five parties. 
And, uh, a small part of the testimony had to do with, uh, me and Duncan and what 
happened in Louisiana.  Ninety percent had to do with how does a black person get a lawyer in 
this state if he wants to assert rights under federal law?  And it was very interesting, uh, to watch.  
Uh, and, uh, in due course, the federal court avoided the constitutional question, which is what 
courts are supposed to do, and they – see, there were two defenses.  One is the Constitution was 
defect – protecting what I was doing.  Another is that Louisiana statute says an out-of-state 
lawyer can practice in cooperation, in association with local counsel if he’s temporarily in the 
state. 
So, I was in my second year of residence here, but the fact is I was on leave from Arnold 
& Porter.  I had an arrangement with them I could go back, and that was official that I was on 
leave.  And I was supposed to go – stay here for one year.  That was my first leave of absence 
was for one year.  At the end of the first year, I’d already been arrested, and the trial was coming 
up.  It just didn’t seem right to be leaving, and plus I was in the middle of a million things that I 
didn’t want to leave.  And, um, they gave me another year’s leave of absence, so that was very 
helpful. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 43 of 59 
 
Uh, and, uh, we tried it, and they were trying to prove that I was a resident by the fact I 
had utility bills, and I’m trying to prove I’m not because I still have a D.C. driver’s license.  That 
was going on.  That was one part.  And the other part was about the state of law in Louisiana, 
and they issued an opinion, ruling on the part that I was temporarily in the state.  Uh, and they 
said that I am temporarily in the state and I was leaving in August, [laughs] like he testified, and 
that I was operating with local counsel, which I certainly was.  Their names went on everything, 
and Bob Collins was there the first day.  I went down alone after the first day, but Bob Collins 
was there that first day. 
And, uh, there was a problem about federal courts issuing injunctions against state 
criminal proceedings, which is embodied in the federal statute, but that is an exception when the 
federal government is asking for the injunction.  So, the government intervening in my behalf 
proved to be very helpful, [laughs] as well, because in the opinion they explained how they could 
issue this injunction by pointing out that the government had asked for it. 
And, um, so then I – all during this period, I filed the application to the Supreme Court 
for writs.  It was granted.  Uh, the argument was scheduled.  Gary Duncan and I and several 
others went up to Washington, and I argued the case.  And, um, the decision came down, a ruling 
that it’s illegal, violates the Fourteenth Amendment not to allow juries in state trials except for 
the most minor crimes, and not including what he was charged with.  And, um, so when it got 
back, uh, they decided to – they tried Duncan again and they didn’t have a jury. 
And we brought a case, saying the only reason they could possibly try the man at this 
point after all this was just, uh, intimidation and vengeance, and we filed a case called Duncan v. 
Perez.  And it went before Judge Cassibry, and he ruled in our favor.  And he issued a nice 
opinion, saying that it was – it couldn’t – it was unbelievable that any other reason could underlie 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 44 of 59 
 
the reason, this was a malicious prosecution, and they enjoined them from prosecuting, retrying 
Duncan.  So, it was kind of a trifecta, I guess, [laughter] in that sense, um, and that’s the story of 
that case. 
JM:  Yeah.  Let me ask about, um – 
RS:  And he grew and turned out to be an important leader in the parish on all kinds of 
other issues.  Uh, he became the head of a – he became a shrimper and he was the head of the 
shrimpers’ association and represented – he became an important figure, uh, after that.  And he’s 
still my friend.  He lives in – he moved out of the parish after the hurricane, but he still lives 
around here. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I want to ask about some of the other work that you did in 
Louisiana.  Um, I think there’s some very interesting, um, uh, voting rights litigation that you 
pursued up in Madison Parish. 
RS:  Madison Parish. 
JM:  Where you won a couple of rather exceptional judicial rulings. 
RS:  Uh, after the Voting Rights Act was passed, in these largely black parishes in upstate 
Louisiana, there was a lot of voter registration.  Uh, you probably know this, but the Act 
bypassed all [1:30:00] the unpleasantness and hurdles of going down to the white registrar who 
hated you and, uh, they would appoint federal registrars and made it nice and simple to get this 
done, get the registration done.  So, um, the voting population became very substantially African 
American. 
And the first instance in which, um, we brought a case was that there was a man named, 
uh, Zelma Wyche, who was the head of the Madison Parish Voters League who was running for 
police chief against the white police chief in town.  And he lost the election when it first was, 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 45 of 59 
 
came by, by about ten or fifteen votes.  And we investigated and later found out that the Clerk of 
Court had gone to the white old-age homes in the parish, of which there were numerous, and got 
all these white people to vote for the – brought them ballots to their bedsides and got them to – 
and it goes without saying he didn’t go to any black old-age homes.  And he had collected 
something like two hundred ballots that way. 
And, uh, we filed suit under the Voting Rights Act.  It was heard by a judge named 
Dawkins in, uh, Monroe.  Um, I believe the government intervened on our side in that case, the 
federal government, but maybe it was the next case.  I don’t really remember.  Wait a second 
now.  Brown – no, that was the second one.  [Someone coughs] I’m trying to get this straight.  
One of them they did; one of them they didn’t, I think.  Anyway, the judge didn’t want to cast 
any aspersions on the public officials, so he adopted a novel doctrine called “discrimination in 
fact.”  He said, “They didn’t mean anything bad, but in fact it was discriminatory,” and he set 
aside the election.  And, um, a new election was held.  Wyche won the election and was police 
chief for many years. 
JM:  Did you advance that doctrine in your claim? 
RS:  The “in fact”?  No, he made that up.  No, I didn’t advance that doctrine.  [Laughter] 
The guy went to the homes, white homes, with these ballots.  I don’t see how you could possibly 
say that, but in any event, I didn’t care.  [Laughter] I didn’t care. 
Uh, and then he – the only one I ever knew who did that same doctrine again was the 
same judge in the next case.  The next case was a, uh – it was a vacancy in the, uh, uh – let me 
get this straight, which position it was.  I think it was a school board position.  There was a 
vacancy, and they had to fill an unexpired term.  In Louisiana, um, there’s a lever you can pull – 
at least there was then – to vote for everybody on the party line.  And the symbol of the 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 46 of 59 
 
Democrats at that point was the rooster.  And you could pull this tab in the voting booth and 
you’d be voting for everybody who’s running as a rooster. 
And, um, so there was a black candidate, a man named Harrison Brown, who was 
running for the school board.  He was a teacher in the school system.  And, um, they 
disconnected the – that position from the line.  So, if you pulled that lever, you voted for 
everybody except Harrison Brown who’s on the line.  And, as a result, most people – most of – 
his supporters didn’t know that.  I think there – didn’t, didn’t – I don’t know how that worked for 
the white candidate, but it didn’t adversely effect the white candidate for some reason or other, 
having to do with the way the ballot was set up.  So, all his supporters went down, all of the 
Voters League members went down to vote for him, and they think they’re voting for him, and 
they walked out and they hadn’t voted for him.  The other guy wins by a tremendous amount. 
Well, same story.  We filed a case.  That’s the one I think the government intervened on.  
Um, and the judge found, after a lengthy trial and all that stuff, and the judge found that it’s 
another instance of “discrimination in fact.”  They didn’t mean it.  And he called – he required 
that election be held again, and it was held again, and Harrison Brown won and was a member of 
the school board.  Um, and that stopped happening up there.  That was the end of that.  The 
elections were right after that.  And, uh, and I think democracy played its will there, as a result of 
the demographics.  [1:35:00] 
JM:  Um-hmm.  You also represented Robert Hicks in a – when he came to you 
concerning the pending construction of some public housing in Bogalusa, and he had some 
concerns, and you were able to find a legal strategy. 
RS:  Yes.  Uh, Hicks was following the plans for the construction of government public 
housing in Bogalusa and realized that, by the placement of housing, they were placing the 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 47 of 59 
 
housing deep into black neighborhoods and deep into white neighborhoods and none along the 
areas that might be considered, uh, mixed.  And he wanted to know whether he could stop it.  
And we researched it and, uh, decided that it was a violation, it could be said to be a violation of 
the nondiscrimination provisions of, uh, a recently enacted – a new civil rights act that had been 
enacted by then.  I think this was 1967.  There was another one.  I’m a little vague on – I think 
this Fair Housing Law was a separate law from the Civil Rights Law and the Voting Rights Law, 
if my memory serves me.  Is that right? 
And, um, we brought the suit under that.  It had never been established that any private 
person could sue under that or that the relief we were seeking was plausible or was available.  
And we litigated that case against the federal government, who had helped us in all these other 
cases. 
JM:  [Laughs] Now you’re suing HUD [Department of Housing and Urban 
Development], I guess. 
RS:  I’m suing HUD.  They’re being represented by the Department of Justice, probably 
by the Civil Rights Division.  And, um, Judge Cassibry found that we did have a right of action 
and that we – it was discriminatory to do that – and he enjoined the construction of the housing 
at the last minute.  They had the, uh, the bulldozers in ready to clear the land, and the word came 
up from New York to Bogalusa: The judge had issued an order to turn off those bulldozers.  And, 
uh, they couldn’t build them that way, and they built them the other way, as far as I remember.  I 
think they did.  Or maybe they abandoned it.  I’m not really sure about that point, but they 
weren’t allowed to do that. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 48 of 59 
 
And I mention that to you as an example of the creativity that Hicks would have in, in 
spotting every aspect of what he was trying to prevent.  And I think we talked earlier about some 
of the treatment of the football players and the cheerleaders and the, uh – 
JM:  You mentioned the prom. 
RS:  The prom.  The same kind of thing with the football players – they wouldn’t allow – 
first they wouldn’t let them on the football team.  Then they wouldn’t play them.  Then they 
would only play them at positions they didn’t want to play in.  We got Judge Heebe into every 
little detail, [laughs] like he was the coach of the football team.  [Laughter] And all that was from 
Robert Hicks, and he wasn’t going to take half a loaf.  And that’s one of the fantastic things 
about the man, really, is that he wasn’t going to settle for part of it.  Um.  So. 
JM:  Um, let me ask – 
RS:  The name of the case is Hicks v. Weaver. 
JM:  Hicks v. Weaver, exactly.  ’69 was the District Court ruling.  I want to ask about 
welfare cases and also a case involving sweet potatoes down in – 
RS:  Okay.  Uh, the welfare cases.  Annie and I – my wife, Annie, and I – and Lolis Elie, 
uh, became involved in representing a group of women who were being criminally prosecuted in 
federal court in New Orleans on charges of welfare fraud, receiving more welfare than they were 
entitled, welfare payments than they were entitled to.  And we tried two of those cases on the 
facts before juries.  I’m going to tell you the result first and then what happened along the way.  
And, um, of the twenty-something women involved, one who had some prior criminal record, 
uh, served three months in prison in West Virginia, and all the others didn’t have any, any 
[1:39:18].  So, it was rather successful.  I think it was kind of – there was some plea bargaining 
there at the end about – after a lot of other litigation I’m about to describe – where they would, 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 49 of 59 
 
um, drop the other cases, this one woman who had this record would serve three months, and that 
would be the end of it. 
Uh, but in the meantime, we dug into it.  And firstly, we challenged the composition of 
the grand jury, the racial and economic composition of the jury that had issued these indictments, 
uh, because these were very petty offences that they were being charged with, uh, and did some 
computer work that enabled us to, um [1:40:00] – the race of the jurors was shown in the court 
records, but the relative poverty/nonpoverty was not.  And we were able to get ahold of the food 
stamp computer tapes – these were the days of computer tapes – and the voting roll tapes and 
have a computer determine what percentage of the people on the food stamp list were registered 
voters.  Registered voters was the source of the jurors.  And it turned out that thirty percent of the 
food stamp recipients were registered to vote, and seventy-eight percent of all other people were 
registered to vote, and that meant that there was not a fair cross section of the community in the 
jury pool.  Uh, the authorities that be wiggled around that by, uh, reducing the figures down to a 
particular grand jury of seventeen and deciding it would only make the difference of 1.4 persons 
per jury.  In other words, instead of representation of 1 statistically, it would be 2.4.  They held 
that difference did not seem – was not substantial. 
JM:  Hmm. 
RS:  Uh, that’s the decision in United States v. [Lorchid] Goff – I cited that – uh, which is 
pretty tricky in my mind, actually.  Uh, there had never – it had never been established at that 
time that there was an economic component to a fair cross section, but since it has been.  But 
they didn’t rule that there wasn’t; they just ruled that there wasn’t enough, which let me just say I 
disagree with. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 50 of 59 
 
Then, when they went to the first trial, the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to 
eliminate every black person on the panel, so that the only people who could be on the jury were 
white.  And the jury was all white.  And we challenged the legality of the use of peremptory 
challenges in that way.  And there was no law on that, because peremptory challenges have 
always been defined as the lawyer can get rid of anybody he wants and he doesn’t have to have a 
reason.  And, uh, we convinced Judge Rubin, the trial judge, it could be any reason they want 
except race, and that this – the fact that they had eliminated every black juror was proof that it 
was race.  And he held that.  And that’s the reported decision called the United States v. 
McDaniels. 
And, um, I believe that hadn’t happened before.  I’m not sure of that.  But I know this, 
that twenty years later, the Supreme Court adopted that as a rule of national applicability in a 
case called Batson [v. Kentucky], uh, where now when a prosecutor in federal courts all over the 
country – if a prosecutor disproportionately removes black jurors, he has to submit in writing to 
the judge reasonable, nonracial reasons for that.  And, as a result, prosecutors don’t do it.  Um, so 
it was a – advanced the ball in that way. 
JM:  Yeah. 
RS:  Um, and I think we did okay by our clients, because what I said – when they first 
were charged, they were all fearful of spending years in jail, and they – they, uh, didn’t have to. 
JM:  Um. 
RS:  This was after LCDC.  See, I came back to Louisiana later on and, uh – 
JM:  Can you just –? 
RS:  Yeah? 
JM:  Carefully do the chronology, the basic chronology –? 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 51 of 59 
 
RS:  Okay. 
JM:  Mid, say,’67 forward, from Leander Perez case forward. 
RS:  Okay.  I stayed in Louisiana, employed by LCDC, until – uh, I stayed in Louisiana 
until August 1968.  I was employed by LCDC until December 1968.  I went to Washington, 
where I’d come from.  I did not want to go back to Arnold & Porter.  I was – you can imagine – 
was a changed person at this point.  Uh, and, um, I worked at the – I had an office at the Institute 
for Policy Studies, and I wrote my part of the article with George.  And, in the meantime, I had 
been offered a position teaching at the University of Michigan, and I – at the first of the year, I 
moved out to Michigan. 
JM:  January ’69? 
RS:  January ’69.  Uh, did not enjoy teaching.  And, in addition to that, I was running to 
Louisiana all the time, uh, because these cases I was handling, I never stopped in them until they 
were over.  Whatever incarnation I was in, I was still doing these cases.  So, I had a schedule of 
teaching Thursday and Friday, which is pretty sweet, really.  But I would leave Saturday 
morning and come back [1:45:00] Wednesday night, and I was in Louisiana at the LCDC office 
the whole time.  So, I didn’t really give it a fair chance.  And the woman I was married to at that 
time didn’t like living in Ann Arbor. 
And so, after one semester, I left and I went to work for Marian Edelman, Marian Wright 
Edelman, at the – what was then called the Washington Research Project.  It wasn’t then focused 
the way it is now.  Now it’s called the Children’s Defense Fund, and now it’s all about children.  
But at that time, that hadn’t been clarified in her mind, and we were going to bring cases that 
would push the government in the right direction on civil rights.  And I did that for two years, 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 52 of 59 
 
with a lot of help.  I mean, there was staff there.  There were people.  There was – much 
different.  Um, and I mentioned a few of the cases in the memo I gave you. 
And, in 1971, uh, I decided I wanted to be back in Louisiana and I moved back.  And, uh, 
that’s – and soon thereafter – well, there was a divorce involved here, and Anne and I – Anne 
came to live with me here.  And that’s when we got into this welfare litigation and other cases, 
other cases.  The case against NOPSI about the bus drivers was in that period and so forth. 
And then, several years later, in 1974, uh, the idea of my children being in Washington 
and me being here kind of caught up with me, and we moved back to Washington, um, lived 
there for seventeen years.  Um, I worked for Marian again for a while.  And then one of the other 
people in that office, Mike Trister, and I opened a law firm, um, on our own, and, um, practiced 
together, Sobol and Trister. 
JM:  Yeah.  Sure.  Um, thank you for that.  Um, two last things, and then we’ll take a 
break and finish up with any last thing that you might have.  You had mentioned earlier, and I 
want to make sure we talk about, there was a very interesting case involving a cooperative that 
sells sweet potatoes. 
RS:  Okay.  Um, the case arose out of the area of Opelousas, Louisiana.  And, um – 
[speaking to Anne] the name of that town again where Stanley lives? 
AS:  Lafayette. 
RS:  Lafayette, Louisiana, where there is a lot of sweet potato growing.  Many of the 
farmers are black farmers, and for years they had been selling the potatoes to a white wholesaler, 
and much of the profit along the line of the potato reaching the table went to the wholesaler and 
not to the farmer.  And a group of people, uh, one of whom was a CORE representative in that 
area, John Zippert, and a Catholic priest, who had been assigned to a parish in that district, name 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 53 of 59 
 
of Alfred McKnight – Albert McKnight, and many of the local farmers formed this cooperative 
to process, package and sell the sweet potatoes. 
And it became a, um – quite resented by the powers, the white power structure, because 
there wasn’t just one white wholesaler.  There were several, and they were all been adversely 
hurt by this.  And so, the D.A. began to, um, uh, hassle them about them about their organization 
and, um, call people before grand juries and all kinds of inappropriate things.  And one night, he 
had his people – had the police break into their office and take away their files, potentially trying 
to put them out of business. 
And, um, the case came to us.  And, um, we sued in federal court in Lafayette to, uh – I 
guess you’d say, uh, prohibit – to enjoin the conduct and to return the documents.  And the 
district attorney had to come into federal court and try to explain what he was doing, and he was 
unable to do that.  And, um, the judge issued an injunction prohibiting him from having any 
contact with this organization.  Um, and the organization is still there.  It’s the – it’s called the, 
uh, Southern Consumers – I forgot the name.  It’s got the words, “Southern Consumers 
Cooperative,” but there’s one more word in it, but it’s, uh [1:50:00] – and the word’s not 
“potato.”  [Laughter] 
JM:  Produce maybe?  Produce?  [Laughter] 
RS:  But anyway.  It’s something there.  And they’re still doing it.  They’re still handling 
their own wholesaling.  So, that was just a thing.  It got me over to Lafayette.  I had never been 
there before.  We didn’t have activity in Lafayette, and, um – got to see what was going on there.  
And, as a result, got to be friends with John Zippert, who was the CORE worker there, um, a 
white man who was wanting to marry one of the young ladies he had met out there, named Carol 
Prejean.  And, um, the Clerk of Court wouldn’t give them a marriage license, because it was 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 54 of 59 
 
mixed race.  And the Supreme Court had just decided Loving v. Virginia, and I waltzed in there 
with my suit to enjoin the, to require the Clerk of Court to give them a marriage license.  And, of 
course, he did, and I got to go to the wedding.  [Laughter] And it was a happy occasion all 
around. 
JM:  Last thing.  You mentioned, um – oh, I’m sorry.  Shall we stop, okay? 
JB:  [unitelligible brief comment] media. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JM:  Okay. 
JB:  You know? 
JM:  I feel out of respect for all that you accomplished that it’s really nice to have some 
of this more extensive record set down.  So, even if we’re touching on it in modest ways, the 
scope of it is another way to make the point, Ms. Sobol, that you’re making [nb: off tape, Ms. 
Sobol has emphasized the scope of her husband’s work and legal accomplishment, noting that he 
is excessively modest in describing his work], and another angle of perspective maybe. 
JB:  We’re rolling again. 
JM:  My final question is this, Mr. Sobol.  You mentioned – and thank you for all your 
patience through a very long interview. 
RS:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  You mentioned at one point that on return to – you know, when you moved away 
from Louisiana in the late ’60s, um, that you kind of left a changed person.  And maybe just 
some reflections on yourself, others you saw, um, move through these very, um, tumultuous and 
involving years on this issue, and your perspective on how that did change you and the things 
that – how you add up the world differently. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 55 of 59 
 
RS:  Okay.  Um, let me say first something which I kind of passed over at the beginning.  
I mentioned that I didn’t think these volunteer lawyers were earning their keep, in terms of the 
cost to send them.  But one thing which is undeniable is after being here for two or three or four 
weeks, they’d go back home, and it would change their lives.  And I – to this day, I’m hearing 
stories about, uh, lawyers who spent a short period of time, either here or in Jackson or in 
Alabama, and they are the head of the Human Rights Commission in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati or 
something of that sort.  And it really is like a contagion.  Uh, I got a very big dose.  [Laughs] But 
even for those smaller doses, it was like a contagion, and it’s remarkable.  And this is true of the 
law students, as well, who had come down.  There was a group called Law Students Committee 
for Civil Rights. 
JM:  “Liscrick.” [LSCRRC, Law Students Civil Rights Research Council] 
RS:  “Liscrick.”  And the law students were also changed and went into public service 
work or pro bono work.  So, I just wanted to mention that, because of what you said.  I had been 
through all these experiences and, um, not just legal, but social.  Uh, and we haven’t mentioned 
the Vietnam War, but that was coming, that was going on, and I was meeting and spending time 
with antiwar activists and felt strongly about that, too. 
And, uh, uh, I got to the point that I could just see that this was what I was interested in, 
and I couldn’t see going back to a firm and being slotted into some antitrust case, uh, 
representing one big corporation against another.  Uh, uh, I, uh – it just – by the time the two 
years was over, I just knew I was going to do work in this area and not some other area, you 
know, not a commercial area. 
And, uh, I was very lucky to be able to do that, actually – not only do it, but do it on my 
own terms in my own law firm.  And the reason were these two union lawyers I mentioned to 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 56 of 59 
 
you before, who made it possible because they really got me into having a billing client.  All this 
stuff I’ve ever done in Louisiana, no one’s ever paid anything for it, except if you win a Title VII 
case, the court makes the defendant pay you, which is nice, but, um, in terms of sustaining a law 
practice, that’s not a very good way to go about it.  Uh, so I felt I wanted to do that and I feel I 
was very lucky to be able to do that. 
And, um, and I don’t know [1:55:00] what else to say about it.  It’s just your mind is 
different.  When I left Arnold & Porter, I wanted that leave of absence.  I wanted that security 
that I could come back and I wasn’t going to be floating out there without a job.  Uh, and then, 
by the first year was up, I was kind of not-so-concerned about it, although they extended it.  At 
the end of the second year, it was just completely out of the question.  I mean I had argued in the 
Supreme Court.  These young lawyers at these big firms, they can go their whole lives and never 
argue in the Supreme Court [laughs] – and to win!  Uh, so it, uh – it just was – I was just 
expanded by it and was able to pursue it. 
JM:  I really want to thank you.  You’ve been extremely generous.  Thank you for joining 
us. 
EN:  Joe?  Joe? 
JM:  Yeah? 
EN:  I do want to get Mrs. Sobol. 
JM:  Sure.  Okay, well, let’s put her – 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JM:  Just do separate files, and that will be important. 
EN:  And if there’s any other context that she wants to put in. 
JM:  Sure. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 57 of 59 
 
JB:  So, we’re rolling. 
JM:  Okay.  This is Thursday, the 26th of May 2011.  My name is Joe Mosnier of the 
Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Um, we are 
here in New Orleans, Louisiana, uh, for the Civil Rights History Project, an undertaking of the 
Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and 
Culture.  Our videographer is Mr. John Bishop.  The project curator, Ms. Elaine Nichols, of the 
museum, is with us.  And we are, um, going to spend some time with Mrs. Anne Buxton Sobol, 
uh, wife of Richard Sobol, also a series interviewee.  And Mrs. Sobol has graciously agreed to 
add a little bit more thought and perspective, um, in relation to the question of a lot of the 
litigation and work of her husband in the ’60s and ’70s in Louisiana.  Nice to be with you; sorry 
for that long tedious setup. 
AS:  Oh, thank you for coming.  Well, I’ve sat here while you’ve interviewed Richard, 
and, um, I think what I have to add is that, uh, he tells the story in a quiet voice and, uh, modestly 
and methodically.  And I think it perhaps doesn’t come through the drama of the times and, uh, 
the relentless way in which Richard pursued these cases. 
I’m a lawyer also.  Um, I am a little bit younger than Richard, and I graduated from law 
school sometime after him, but I practiced with him early in my career and have off and on 
throughout my career.  And, uh, he, uh, is very creative in, um, the, uh, grounds he asserts in his 
cases.  Um, he’s incredibly well educated in the law and, um, just would throw the book at 
people that were the other side of these discrimination cases. 
And he was – the most dramatic points were his cross examination of, say, for instance, 
supervisors, um, in an employment discrimination case, or somebody made a hiring decision, 
um, and, uh, it was high drama.  And it was, uh – I think he’s said what, uh, an unusual time it 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11 
Page 58 of 59 
 
was to be a young person, um, with his gifts.  Um, it was really exciting to have the chance to 
make a big difference in a way that sometimes doesn’t seem like it’s any longer possible to do. 
JM:  Yeah.  Let me just, um – thank you for that.  And let me ask you, um, can you think 
of a – can you think of an anecdote or a story or a moment, an episode that comes to your mind 
to illustrate that essential point about Mr. Sobol that you’re making? 
AS:  Well, uh, I don’t remember what preceded it, but in the, uh, case about the 
segregated longshore locals in New Orleans – they had a white union and a black union.  And in 
that case, the Williams case, uh, uh, the opposing counsel really didn’t like Richard and didn’t 
like Richard pushing his clients around in cross examination, not literally pushing them around.  
And, uh, I think also, uh, Richard was not afraid to say when the lawyer on the other side was 
lying, [2:00:00] not telling the truth, uh.  And I think Richard had basically just called this guy a 
lawyer – a liar – and, um, the guy got up and he ran at Richard.  And George Strickler, who came 
after Richard at LCDC and who is a professor at Tulane Law School and was the original lawyer 
in the Williams case, got up and threw a block!  [Laughs] This lawyer was coming at Richard 
that Richard had called – 
JM:  In the courtroom? 
RS:  In the courtroom in front of Judge Heebe.  And that was pretty dramatic, I guess 
you’d have to say. 
JM:  I should say that’s not a very typical daily – I mean that’s not a typical thing in a 
federal courtroom. 
AS:  Right. 
JM:  Yeah.  Well, thank you so much for this contribution. 
AS:  Well, thanks for putting it on the record for Richard. 
Richard Sobol Interview, 5-26-11

JB:  Is there something else you wanted to add? 
AS:  No, really.  Thanks. 
JM:  Thank you so much. 
EN:  Thank you. 
JB:  We still have two hours of recording time.  [Laughter] 
JM:  These folks are going to push us out the door. 
AS:  [Laughing] You’ve got to get out and have your New Orleans experience. 
[Recording ends at 2:01:07] 
 
END OF INTERVIEW
