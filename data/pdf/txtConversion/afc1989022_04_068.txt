FIELDNOTES 
IAW-PFN-FO61390.A 
-- 
Met about four hours with field coordinator Steve 
Siporin and fellow field worker Tom Carter to plan and coordinate the Carbon 
County, Utah project. 
I 
expressed the desire to integrate my own work with 
the history of Italians in Utah and their places of origin, specifically in 
Calabria, southern Italy, with a 
look at contemporary folk life of those of 
Italian descent living in Carbon County. 
My area of expertise is history, 
while Steve has done solid work on the folk traditions of the Nick family, and 
Tom will document folk architecture. 
We discussed some broad themes, such as 
labor, food preparation, housing, and religion; and talked of possible 
contacts. 
I 
suggested that Steve begin with Al Veltri, Edna Romano, and Stan 
Litizzette of Helper. 
Dr. J. Eldon Dorman, a 
long-time coal camp doctor, was 
suggested as another possible informant. 
Steve and I 
mapped out those interviews we could do separately and those 
we both should conduct. 
Tom was especially interested in the Camillo Manina 
house, located in Spring Glen, near Helper. 
I 
also suggested the sites of 
some stone houses and buildings, such as the Gigliotti Block built by Felice 
Gigliotti; and outdoor baking ovens built by Willy Verde and Charlie 
Saccomano. 
Tom expressed a 
desire for me to do some of the historical work on 
some of these sites. 
We returned to the Utah State Historical Society where I 
located some 
names, addresses, and phone numbers for Steve and Tom to use on their venture 
into Carbon County. 
I 
also located some preliminary information from the 
Society's historic preservation files on Carbon County sites. 
IAW-PFN-FO61890.A 
-- 
Received a 
phone call from Tom Carter, then in 
the field in Helper, inquiring about stone houses on Welby Street, the area 
known as Milano Court. 
I 
spent some time perusing the preservation files for 
the Helper Historic District and located "Structure/Site" forms for buildings 
at 50, 52, 54, and 56 Welby Street. 
I 
xeroxed copies of these for Tom to use 
in future field work. 
From the forms we learned that Joe Milano, identified 
as a 
northern Italian, worked as a 
stone mason and blacksmith in Carbon 
County. 
These houses, and a 
blacksmith shop, were built by him for family 
members. 
The subject will be pursued. 
IAW-PFN-FO71490.A 
-- 
I 
began to do research into the life of Joe 
Milano by looking at the "Obituary Indexes" for the Deseret News and The Salt 
Lake Tribune. His name was not found here, so I 
took down the names of other 
Milanos and began a 
search. 
This day ended with no success. 
IAW-PFN-FO71990.A 
-- 
Continued my research on Joe Milano by checking 
another copy of the Deseret News obituary index for the years 1956 to 1960. 
I 
found an obituary for Joe Milano in the Deseret News, 1 
June 1960, p. B9. 
He 
2 
was born 29 June 1874 in Forno Canavese, Torino, Italy; married Domenica 
Bottino in 1900, and was a 
member of the Stella D'America Lodge in Helper 
(still in existence). 
He was also listed as a 
member of the United Mine 
Workers of America, and a 
retired blacksmith and coal miner. 
He had a 
brother, Frank in Salt Lake City, and sisters, Mrs. Bertha DeVieta (Helper), 
and Mrs. Anna Berkot [?], Italy. 
His son Pete lived in Salt Lake City. 
By 
locating a 
specific place of birth, I 
can now connect, at least 
geographically, Milano with Camillo Manina, whose house will be further 
documented. 
Tom Carter will document Milano Court from an architectural 
perspective. 
Edna Romano, of Helper, visited the Historical Society. 
I 
spent about 
two hours with her setting up some field work. 
We talked about the Helper 
Cemetery and the existence of headstones written in Italian. 
This intrigues 
me because of my own work in Italian cemeteries and the use of the English 
language. 
I 
plan to spend some time at the cemetery in Helper. 
IAW-PFN-F072690.A 
-- 
Talked with Steve Siporin about his work to date. 
We are planning to meet next Wednesday, August 1 
in Price and spend at least 
two days together. 
Steve indicated that Tom is planning to document Milano 
Court, the Manina house, and the boarding house in Columbia; but not the Verdi 
oven, primarily because Willy Verde is dead and the oven is not in current 
use. 
I 
still may want to pursue the matter because of some comparative work 
that I 
did with similar ovens in Calabria. 
In any event, Steve and I 
will 
talk with the Saccomanos, who also used such ovens. 
I 
also mentioned to Steve 
3 
that I 
plan to document "All State Italian Day" 12 August 1990 at the Lagoon 
amusement park near Salt Lake City. 
IAW-PFN-FO73190.A 
-- 
Maria and I 
left for Carbon County at 4:45 p.m. 
Maria wanted to accompany me on this trip, primarily to meet with Vito and 
Filomena Bonacci. 
In addition, she has some valuable insights that proved 
helpful during the evening, including a 
command of the Calabrese dialect. 
As we traveled, Italian folk music, from Calabria, help to create a 
certain 
mood conducive to research on Italians in Utah. 
We arrived in Price at 6:30 
p.m., checked into the Mr. Sleep Motel, and left immediately for Spring Glen. 
IAW-PFN-FO73190.B 
-- 
We drove directly to the home of Vito and 
Filomena (Fazzio) Bonacci on Blue Hill Dairy Road in Spring Glen (about one 
mile south of Helper, and near the Camillo Manina house). 
Vito's niece, 
Marietta DiFazio, and her husband Vincenzo, are close acquaintances of ours 
from Decollatura, Catanzaro (CZ), Italy. 
I 
had phoned the Bonaccis Sunday, 29 
July to set up our visit. 
Vito greeted us at the door with a 
smile, we had 
visited them last year and they were anxious to see us again. 
Our role as 
close friends with their Italian relatives have endeared us to them. 
Filomena 
also greets us with a 
smile. 
Maria kissed Vito and Filomena; I 
kissed 
Filomena and shook hands with Vito -- a 
definite sign of mutual respect and 
welcome. 
After introductory greetings, Filomena asked us of tomorrow. 
"We want 
you here for supper," she said. 
Also, while in Italy in August 1989, Maria 
and I 
visited with the Bonacci relatives and video taped a 
personal message --
4 
we brought the tape with us. 
Vito and Filomena do not have a 
VCR; therefore, 
she arranged with her son, Joe, to view this at his home. 
She asked if 
Thursday would be alright; preferably when Joe's wife could view it too. 
We 
set it up for Thursday. 
The four of us sat in the living room discussing a 
wide array of topics. 
Of course, we began with the Italian relatives, Marietta and Vincenzo. 
In the 
past we have discussed intimate family business pertaining to land holdings 
and dealings in Decollatura (CZ), Italy. 
Vincenzo is helping to clear up a 
matter there, and we talked of his tiring efforts. 
Filomena mentioned that 
they had recently heard that Vincenzo had broken a 
leg. 
Vito added that 
Vincenzo always asks if Maria and "Filippo" have visited when he calls or 
writes. 
In fact, Vito stated that he was waiting to communicate with Vincenzo 
until the time he could add that we had indeed visited. 
Vincenzo and Marietta 
were planning to visit the United States, but this accident has altered their 
plans. 
As a 
footnote to this matter, Vincenzo never knew his father, 
Giovanni, who had immigrated to the U.S., settled in Carbon County, and was 
killed in 1925 by a 
fellow immigrant. 
The story, as of yet not unraveled (I 
am working on it), is sad, perhaps typical to many immigrants, and one which 
has had a 
profound and lasting impact on the lives of relatives and friends. 
It "remains" important! 
Filomena offered us something to drink -- coffee, ice tea, whatever. 
take some cool tea for a 
warm evening. 
Vito begins to tell us of his life 
I 
mentioned that tomorrow I 
would like to interview him on tape. 
Therefore, 
we had a 
"pre 
these people. 
that while he 
We 
interview" interview, where I 
learned a 
great deal more about 
Perhaps the over riding theme of Vito's two hour discussion was 
loves his "adopted mother" (the U.S.A.) and respects her laws, 
5 
it is his "real mother" (Italy) that he cannot forget. 
This is quite 
significant, and I 
believe is a 
factor because of his continued close ties 
with Marietta and Vincenzo. 
Vito is eighty-nine (89) years old, having come to the U.S. in 1919 from 
Deco IIatura, 
Italy_. 
He is extremely sharp and recounts history without 
muct Kesitation. ­ The interview tomorrow should be a 
good one. 
After about an 
hour, maria and Filomena go outside to look at the garden -- not very good 
they say because they do not have much water. 
Vito and I 
continue talking. 
he presents a 
brief chronology of his life, all the time stressing the "hard 
life" he has lived. 
I 
was struck by the overall "negative" nature of his 
discourse. 
Ironically, when he mentioned that he once sang Italian songs, his 
face sported a 
huge smile. 
I 
had found something more to pursue. 
At about 9:00 p.m. we went outside on the front porch, where Vito and 
Filomena spend much time on summer nights. 
Maria and Filomena joined us and 
we talked of tomorrow's plans. 
As Filomena mentioned food, a 
few Italian 
words were uttered, as though the subject of "food" triggered the change. 
Two 
grand children arrived and were introduced to us. 
We talked of general 
subjects, but with the boy, who is a 
butcher at City Market, we talked of cars 
and trucks. 
We left at about 10:00 p.m., having decided to meet tomorrow at about 
1:00 p.m., but "anytime would be fine." 
I 
asked if Steve Siporin could 
accompany us and the answer is a 
definite "yes." 
At the motel I 
begin writing 
my field notes, which lasts into the early morning hours. 
I 
will finish them 
later. 
6 
IAW-PFN-F080190.A 
-- 
Wrote field notes from 7:00 to 8:30 a.m. 
At 9:30 
Maria and I 
left for the Mountain View Cemetery in Helper. 
Tom and Steve had 
documented this, but I 
wanted to retrace some steps from years ago. 
Glad I 
did. 
I 
loaded black and white film into my camera (see IAW-PFN-B.001). 
A 
first observation was that the cemetery, as in Italy, is located on a 
hill 
slightly out of town. 
As we entered, Maria noticed a 
badly weathered, hand 
drawn "index" of people buried there; a 
project of Edna Romano's fourth grade 
(?) class. 
The first head stone I 
noticed was written in Italian, as follows: 
"Qui Giace Antonio Cavaiani Nato it 23 Apr. 1877 E 
Mori' it 13 Feb 1920." 
I 
guess this is what I 
was especially looking for; the use of the Italian 
language and any "unique" images. 
Maria traveled in one direction and I 
in 
another. 
As I 
walked about, a 
headstone with "Smith" carved on it caught my 
eye. 
What an irony; here, the name Smith seems out of place. 
IAW-PFN-F080190.B 
-- 
We met Steve Siporin at about 1:00 p.m. 
He 
provided me with some film and a 
tape recorder that David Taylor had sent from 
the project in Colorado. 
I 
told him that we had been invited to eat at the 
Bonacci home. 
We left at about 1:30 p.m., stopping at the liquor store in 
Helper. 
Maria and I 
wanted to bring a 
bottle of wine to Vito and Filomena as 
a 
gift for the dinner invitation. 
At the store Steve and I 
talked to the 
clerk about wine that Italians in Helper preferred -- one such wine was 
"Paisano." 
She told Steve of Italians who made their own wine. 
He wrote down 
the names. 
At least wine is still being made in some homes. 
Upon arrival at the Bonacci home, we were greeted in the same cheerful 
manner as yesterday. 
I 
introduced Steve and it seemed as though we had all 
7 
been together for years. 
We decided to keep Steve's "sound stage" equipment 
in the car until the interview would be conducted. 
Our first task was to 
photograph all that we could. 
Steve shot color; I 
took black and whites. 
We 
shot religious items on the walls, Filomena preparing dinner (which she was 
somewhat ambivalent about), rooms in the house, photographs and certificates 
on the walls (two were Papal blessings made for Filomena and Vito). 
Vito 
started to tell Steve some of the information that he mentioned to me the 
night before. 
As he talked, we photographed. 
Filomena journeyed back and 
forth to the kitchen as she prepared a 
dinner of pasta, meatballs, salad, 
bread, and fried chicken. 
It was served all at once. 
We drank red wine 
(purchased in a liquor store). 
I 
set up my tripod and photographed us at 
dinner. 
Steve did likewise. 
Filomena kept asking us if we would like more 
sauce. 
We talked of food and the family trip to Italy. 
Again, the connection 
between food and ethnic identity was striking. 
After dinner we congregated for the interview. 
Steve set up his 
"miniature" sound stage. 
Vito basically went over the same information as the 
night before -- a 
chronological approach to his recollections. 
After several 
hours, Steve and I 
agreed to continue this tomorrow. 
We made a 
quick visit to 
the garden in the back yard. 
Vito showed us his tomatoes, mentioning 
specifically that another row of tomatoes were planted "Italian style" -- with 
wooden stakes and cross pieces attached so that the vines could climb. 
Maria and I 
had to leave to meet Dr. J. Eldon Dorman; Steve needed to 
meet Tom Carter. 
We left at about 6:00 p.m. 
8 
IAW-PFN-FO80190.0 
-- 
We drove to Joe's Valley, about one hour south of 
Price to meet with Dr. J. Eldon Dorman and his wife Maureen. 
Dr. Dorman was a 
coal camp doctor and dealt with many Italian miners and their families (still 
does). 
As we discussed the subject, he made continual reference to his 
article, which I 
edited, for the book, Carbon County: 
Eastern Utah's  
Industrialized Island (also edited by myself). 
Steve had given me a 
new tape 
recorder, sent by David, and I 
"thought" I 
knew how to use it -- wrong! 
It 
did not work for me, so a 
recording was not made. 
Dr. Dorman has a 
good 
memory and recalls specific individuals and families. 
His overall 
recollections seemed always to center on the themes of "hospitality" and 
"respect" for his position as demonstrated by his Italian patients. These are 
two values that have been traditionally important in peasant societies, such 
as southern Italy, and continue as such. 
One interesting observation is that 
after awhile, Dr. Dorman's discussion became less of one on Italians, and more 
a 
description of life with miners in general. 
This supports one of my 
assertions that life in a 
mining town held many of the same elements for all 
diverse cultural groups. 
Many peoples had chickens, rabbits, hogs, etc.; and 
many made soap, canned vegetables, and planted gardens. 
In other words, many 
immigrant groups shared the same existence in a 
mining camp or town. 
Maria and I 
talked with the Dormans until about 12:00 midnight. 
IAW-PFN-FO80290.A 
-- 
In the morning I 
photographed the Dormans. 
We 
visited their land in Joe's Valley and we left after lunch. 
We had to meet 
Steve at 1:00 p.m. 
9 
IAW-PFN-F080290.B 
-- 
Steve was waiting at the motel. 
We loaded some 
equipment and traveled to the Camillo Manina house, where Tom Carter and two 
students were documenting the home. 
I 
walked around the house -- convinced 
more than ever of a 
connection between this place and similar styles in Italy. 
Fruit trees exist in the yard, as do various outbuildings, probably used as 
chicken coops and pig pens. 
We could not prove if such outbuildings were part 
of the original homestead. 
It looks as though there might be two apartments 
in the house -- one upstairs and one down. 
If so, many such houses in Italian 
villages are now used in the same way; perhaps a 
product of similar economic 
times. 
We also noticed an outdoor, covered kitchen. 
Must find out more about 
this. 
IAW-PFN-F080290.0 
-- 
Steve, Maria, and I 
arrived at the Bonacci home 
at about 2:15 p.m. 
Their son Joe had brought them a 
VCR and monitor for 
viewing the tape we had from Italy. 
After some preliminary greetings, we 
settled down in the living room to view the video. 
Steve had his camera ready 
-- we were especially anxious to record the reactions of Vito and Filomena. 
As the tape played, with personal messages directed to both of them, tears of 
joy flowed freely. 
I 
even shed a 
few!! 
It was obvious that these two had a 
definite emotional connection to their Italian relatives. 
Maria and I 
explained the countryside and buildings associated with Vincenzo DiFazio's 
"country home." 
Vito and Filomena remember being there. 
They also saw an 
interview we taped with Raffaele Scalzo, a 
returned immigrant who had lived in 
Carbon County in the 1920s. 
Vito said, "Boy, he looks old!" 
They wanted to 
see more, so I 
showed them some of the religious feast days. 
I 
asked if such 
10 
celebrations ever occurred in Carbon County and they replied "no." 
I 
left the 
tape there so that the boys could see it too. 
Steve and I 
continued talking with them on tape. 
As the conversation 
progressed, we began to ask Filomena questions about her mother. 
I 
asked of 
food preparation, especially in the making of sausage. 
Filomena recalled her 
mother making a 
sausage consisting of pork butts and shoulders, salt, and 
pepper. 
No fennel was used. 
The use of this spice is definitely a 
zonal 
and/or village variation in Calabria. 
IAW-PFN-F080390.A 
-- 
Tom Carter called me from the field, inquiring 
about the availability of information on the Verdi outdoor domed baking oven 
on Sanborn insurance maps. 
I 
located a 
1931 Sanborn map of Helper, but 
discovered that the Verde property was outside the map boundary. 
However, I 
did locate the property of Milano Court. 
Steve called to get what information 
I 
had found. 
IAW-PFN-F080390.6 
-- 
I 
worked on Field notes on and off throughout the 
day as time allowed. 
IAW-PFN-F081290.A 
-- 
Today is the fifty-sixth All State Italian Day at 
the Lagoon amusement park in Farmington, Utah, approximately fifteen miles 
north of Salt Lake City. 
This annual event is sponsored by the Men's and 
Women's Chapters of the Italian American Civic League (IACL). 
I 
remember this 
11 
celebration from my youth - 
my family always attended. 
This day Maria and I 
arrived at the resort at approximately 11:45 a.m. 
The admission, including 
parking, has increased tremendously ($3 for parking, $5 each for park 
admission only, or $11.50 to $16.50 for ride passes). 
In the northeast 
section of the park several pavilions have been reserved with signs stating 
"Welcome All State Italian Day." 
Entrance to the main pavilion is lined with 
food booths, and a 
table packed with "Italian" souvenirs -- tee shirts, bibs, 
hats, etc. 
I 
begin taking photographs - 
wrapped around me are two 35 mm 
cameras, a 
tape recorder, and a 
video camera. 
"Paesani" quickly got the 
message that I 
was documenting this event!! 
Maria and I 
found a 
place on a 
table in the main pavilion. 
Maria had made some fired squash and egg plant 
patties earlier in the morning just for this day. 
I 
packed some soda and 
beer, knowing their would be wine to drink as the day passed. 
The first thing was Sunday morning Mass celebrated by Rev. Thomas 
Meersman at 12:00 Noon. 
Fr. Meersman studied at the North American College in 
Rome and speaks excellent Italian. 
For this reason, he has been close to 
Utah's Italian population. 
His remarks throughout the liturgy reflect on 
Italians. 
He notes specifically that Italians have a 
special love and 
devotion to the "Blessed Mother" (the Virgin Mary). 
Some one-hundred gather 
at the outdoor pavilion during this service. 
The fact that many of us had on 
tee shirts with some type of Italian identification caught my eye. 
As I 
glanced at blue eyes, blond hair, and people completely out of any stereotyped 
features of what Italians look like, these tee shirts seemed the only way to 
identify those who wanted to demonstrate their ethnicity. 
After Mass I 
hurried to the main pavilion to begin snapping photographs. 
People stopped to pose for me, although I 
really wanted them to continue 
12 
interacting. 
People working behind the food booths, however, would glance at 
me quickly and then resume serving customers. 
As I 
began photographing 
workers selling "Italian sausage" sandwiches, one gentleman jumped over and 
approached me with the question, "You're Phil Notarianni, aren't you?" 
"Yes," 
I 
replied. 
"I'am Joe Veltri, Al Veltri's son," he said. 
This was the 
individual who Steve wants to interview and photograph at home in Salt Lake 
City. 
Joe and I 
began what was to be a 
series of conversations throughout the 
day. 
Interviewing on tape was out of the question, with much noise and many 
interruptions. 
Joe's mother is Greek and his father Italian. 
I 
was struck as 
to how he related more to his Greek background than Italian. 
He speaks some 
Greek, not Italian, and discussed his trip to Greece with great fondness. 
As 
he talked of his experiences, I 
could not help but think how many young people 
of "Italian descent" (where the mother is not Italian) relate more to their 
mother's ethnicity. 
That women appear to be strong "carriers of culture" is 
visible among many in the Italian community. 
I 
set up an interview and 
evening with the Veltris - 
to be finalized when Steve returns from the 
Northwest. 
Margaret Besso, the daughter of Domenic Besso, the shoemaker from Price, 
approaches and wishes to talk. 
I 
notice her father and go over to re-
introduce myself. 
He immediately begins reminiscing about various 
experiences. 
Steve had also talked with him in Price. 
My brother, Louie, who 
has taken up my father's trade as a 
shoemaker (part time) approaches and 
enters the conversation. 
Lou then takes the video camera and begins filming. 
Both Margaret, who is president of the Women's Chapter of the IACL, and 
Domenic are working the booth selling drinks. 
I 
promise to visit Domenic's 
shop in Price. 
13 
Much of the interaction centered around talk of past Lagoon Days. 
Many 
with whom I 
conversed made specific mention of the lack of people this year. 
"It's not what it used to be," many retorted; "practically all of the old 
timers are gone!" 
Many believed that increased costs of entering Lagoon were 
prohibitive. 
The president of the Men's Chapter, John Tella, urged me to 
attend League meetings. 
"We need to figure something else out," he stated. 
As I 
looked out over the crowd, it was obvious that talk and food highlighted 
the day's interaction. 
I 
observed less "traditional" foods, such as rice 
balls and squash patties, but more of the "Kentucky Fried Chicken" variety. 
Games were played in the afternoon. 
First, various children's races. 
At 4:30 p.m. a 
boccie tournament prevailed. 
Teenagers and adults alike 
participated in team play. 
While photographing play, I 
was confronted by a 
Carlo Terzo, a 
Sicilian gentlemen, who offered me some of his homemade wine. 
It was made from home grown Zinfandel grapes -- quite good!! 
He told me how 
he had to be careful because it was against the law to make wine in Utah. 
In 
fact, he carried the wine in a 
two liter soda bottle in order to disguise it. 
He made only enough for his consumption. 
But in typical fashion, he offered 
some to many people. 
It was obvious that sharing and reaping a 
positive 
response delighted him. 
The boccie tournament ended, but I 
observed that many 
"Italian" Italians took the game far more seriously than did others. 
While games were played outside, bingo was being called inside the main 
pavilion. 
This followed a 
formal opening of the festivities by the presidents 
of the men's and women's chapters, and a 
greeting from the new Italian Vice 
Consul of Salt Lake City. 
He is Giuseppe Maschero, a 
chiropractor from 
Genova. 
The fact that he had converted to Mormonism, formed a 
topic of 
14 
discussion among other Italians. 
It was obvious that some doubted if he could 
represent their interests. 
Maria and I 
sat at our table talking. 
Suddenly, a 
family friend 
introduced us to a 
young woman from Italy who is studying in Utah. 
She is 
eighteen years old, and had converted to Mormonism in Torino. 
She now leaves 
in Salt Lake, rooming with a 
woman from Brazil. 
I 
begin talking Italian and 
when she is introduced to Maria, who is fluent, a 
true friendship begins. 
Maria later confides in me how difficult she would find converting to 
Mormonism. 
"Most values are just not the same," she says. 
I 
introduce the 
student, who is need of some assistance, to the Italian Vice Consul. 
First, 
she mentions being from Torino, then being "LDS," commenting on the beauty of 
the LDS Temple. 
She is alone in Utah; her mother remains in Torino. 
Joe Veltri introduces me to others in his group. 
One other family, the 
Bottinos, from Carbon County are present. 
Thus, I 
found the Veltris, 
Bottinos, and Bessos from Carbon County at the event. 
Joe did not venture to 
guess why more did not attend. 
I 
offered him some iced espresso coffee, which 
he enjoyed very much. 
As the day wound down, people began leaving at about 6:00 p.m. 
We 
stayed until 7:00 p.m., then packed to leave. 
I 
too reflected on past Italian 
Days and felt a 
difference. 
It struck me that I 
was becoming one of the "old 
timers" from past days.

spent about two hours researching the obituary 
index for Tony Verdi[e], of the Verdi property. 
His father, the probable 
owner of the house in Helper, was named Anthony. 
Tony died at the age of 37 
15 
from injuries received in a 
mine accident - a 
cave-in at the Castle Gate mine. 
He died on 7 
July 1951. 
He was born in 1914 at Sunnyside, Utah. 
He was the 
son of Anthony and Marie DeAngelis Verde. 
Obituaries appeared as follows: 
The Salt Lake Tribune, 8 
July 1951, p. A-13; 10 July 1951, p. 19 
[photo]. 
Deseret News, 8 
July 1951, p. B-4; 9 
July 1951, p. A-4. 
More work is needed.

Three hours were spent researching through the 
1900 and 1910 manuscript census for Carbon County, Utah. 
These are the 
microfilm copies of the original enumerator's records. 
I 
was looking 
specifically for information on the Verdi family for Tom Carter. 
In 1900 
Antonio and Marie Verdi were living in Helper with two children. 
By 1910 they 
were in Sunnyside with five children ("John, Sontina [Cynthia], Raphilina 
[Ruth], Ellenora [Helen], & 
Catherine" [sic]) [Anthony, James [ace], William, 
Ida [Edith]- info given to me on 20 Oct. 1990 by Edith Pitts]. 
According to 
the census, Antonio immigrated to the United States in 1890, was not a 
citizen, and spoke only Italian. 
In our attempts to date the Verdi home, it 
appears that the Verdis did not move back to Helper until after 1914, since 
their son Tony, who was killed in 1951, was born in Sunnyside in 1914.

Maria and I 
left for Price after work, arriving 
at Day's Inn at about 7:00 p.m. 
I 
prepared notes and a 
plan for this 
weekend's work.

IAW-PFN-F.090190.A 
-- 
We drove to the home of Vito and Filomena 
Bonacci to bring them some fresh figs from St. George and some pizzelle that 
Maria had made. 
We found that Filomena had been taken to the hospital the 
night before due to a 
heart condition. 
Vito was visibly shaken as he came to 
the door. 
He told us what had happened. 
We entered and sat to talk -- it 
seemed to take his mind off of things. 
I 
asked him about other "Bonacci" 
families in Carbon County. 
He said that Frank Bonacci, the United Mine 
Workers of America (UMWA) organizer, was Filomena's uncle and that "maybe" he 
was a 
distant cousin of Vito's father, Domenic. 
He was no relative of Tony 
Bonacci, who was associated with the National Miners' Union of the 1930s. 
Vito again spoke of the 1922 strike and his work history. 
His "hard times" 
again came through. 
After about forty-five minutes, Filomena returned from the hospital with 
their youngest son Joe. 
She was alright and had been kept for observation 
only. 
The situation was immediately calmer. 
I 
decided to do an interview 
with Joe, he consented, so we talked in the living room. 
I 
was particularly 
interested in recording his observations about the trip the family took to 
Italy in 1983 and how that might have influenced his self identity as an 
Italian. 
Joe's wife is also of Italian heritage, and originally from 
Illinois. 
Her family came from Milano, and were named Milani. 
I 
learned that 
this self identity was linked to his father's (Vito) stories of Italy. 
Joe 
stated, "Dad always told us stories about Italy." 
Joe was anxious to see the 
area that formed the basis for those stories. 
They were "lesson" stories -
how far Vito had to travel, the sacrifices he had to make, etc. Joe, who had 
at one time trained for the Catholic priesthood, mentioned that he felt a 
17 
little more at home there primarily because the Latin that he had studied 
allowed him to understand the language more. 
Domenic, the oldest, does not 
know the Italian language. 
As Joe and I 
were talking, Filomena, recently released from the 
hospital, was busy preparing a 
lunch of "soppressata" (salami), cheese, bread, 
coffee, and cookies. 
"I need to keep busy," she said. 
Joe insisted, "Let her 
do it. 
She needs something to occupy her." 
We moved the tape recorder to the 
dining room table and continued the interview with Vito, Filomena, and Maria. 
The Italy trip continued to be the main topic. 
I 
asked of food. 
Joe quickly 
responded that they brought instant coffee with them, including two "American 
cups." 
Vito and Filomena drank coffee from them first, and then Joe and 
Domenic. 
The timing and quantity of the meals in Italy stood out as 
significant. 
They missed an "American" breakfast, and could not get used to a 
large meal at Noon and one late in the evening. 
Joe said the pasta tasted 
especially good. 
Filomena added that Vito's brother, Carmine, liked how 
Filomena prepared some foods, especially "mashed potatoes and gravy." 
In 
fact, Carmine wanted the gravy saved for his pasta. 
Joe made the point, in connecting Vito's stories to the trip, that he 
was awed with the actual distances that Vito mentioned he had traveled as a 
youth. 
This was especially the case in looking at the distance from 
Decollatura to Nicastro, and on to the sea. 
I 
asked him of the landscape and 
he answered that felt a 
connection between the rock work in Carbon County and 
the rock work he had seen in Italy (I was to find out later that one of the 
chief stone masons in Carbon County 
Felice rigliotti 
was in fact from 
Decollatura). 
Joe believes this rock work looks quite similar and in this 
regard, thought of Carbon County when he observed the Calabrian countryside. 
18 
Joe said that relatives provided them a 
closeness to their Italian 
heritage. 
In fact, Vito had earlier confided that only upon the death of his 
brother, several years ago, did he finally know that he would not return to 
Italy. 
The desire to return permanently had lingered all these years. 
We finished lunch, helped clear the table, and left at about 2:00 p.m. 
IAW-PFN-F.090190.B

We returned to the Mountain View Cemetery in 
Helper to take color slides of headstones. 
We walked every inch of the 
grounds. 
During this trip, I 
was especially attracted to the graves of 
victims of the 1924 Castle Gate mine explosion. 
Many of these stone markers 
were written in Italian. 
Some Italian place names, especially those in 
Calabria, were not familiar to either Maria or myself. 
I 
must look them up on 
a 
map. 
As Steve noted, misspellings of Italian words are quite noticeable. 
This could be attributed both to stone carvers who misread Italian words, or 
to the immigrants themselves who misspelled them or tried to "Americanize" the 
Italian spelling. 
IAW-PFN-F.090190.0 
-- 
Our next stop was the home of Mary Nick Juliano 
in Price. 
I 
wanted especially to photograph her home, which has many family 
photographs and religious objects on walls and furniture. 
She warmed to Maria 
immediately and agreed to an interview and photographs. 
I 
figured that Steve 
had probably interviewed her in past years (as part of his research on the 
Nick family), but decided to pursue an interview when she recited some poetry, 
both in English and Italian. 
Throughout the interview, Mary often moved from 
19 
English into Italian, as though she could express somethings better in 
Italian. 
Mary was the oldest of the Nick children, thus, a 
central figure in 
the household. 
She remembered "papa and mama" well, and recounted much 
concerning food preparation (see IAW-PFN-A004) and the particular closeness 
she remembered with her grandmother in San Giovanni in Fiore. 
In fact, she 
stated that she was closer to her grandmother than her mother, who had to work 
as a 
seamstress. 
She showed me  some examples of her (Mary-'s)-needle work. 
She also kept questioning the value of some of the things she said and did, 
with such statements as "that's silly isn't it." 
Mary remembers San Giovanni 
in a 
positive way. 
Tomorrow, September 2, is her 86th birthday! 
In speaking of the complicated nature of her family life, I 
again began 
to think of the common stereotype of the "close Italian family." 
The 
institution of the family is indeed a 
complicated one and needs more study in 
the context of Utah Italian families.

I 
got up early to write field notes from

So much information to absorb!

Maria and I 
went to Sunday Mass at St. Anthony's 
Catholic Church in Helper. 
As we entered the building, I 
remembered that St. 
Anthony's had been built in Helper largely because of the Italian population 
here; thus, the name St. Anthony's. 
In Price, which housed a 
large number of 
French Basques, the Catholic parish there is Notre Dame de Lourdes. 
Stained 
glass windows of saints lined the church, with St. Anthony quite evident. 
20 
There is a 
statue of the patron saint in the rear of the church. 
Joe Bonacci 
and his wife were also present at the 10:30 a.m. Mass. 
As we left, the 
current parish priest, upon finding out that we were from Magna, told us 
stories of Rev. Francis Pellegrino, a 
Helper native, and a 
former pastor of 
St. Anthony's and Our Lady of Lourdes in Magna. 
Father Pellegrino is somewhat 
of a 
folk character in Utah. 
He is currently on a 
sabbatical in California.

We drove to the five stone houses on "Milano 
Court" to photograph them. 
I 
took both color slides and black and white 
prints. 
These houses stand ou"uite dist.in ti-ve y and re-pre-seta
-vivid 
reminder of Italian stone work in the area. This research project has 
heightened my awareness of the significance of the stone work done in Carbon 
County by Italian craftsmen. 
Most interviews mention this as an important 
part of the landscape.

-- 
With stone masons in mind, we drove to the store 
and home of -Ross Gigliotti, who owns the Texaco station and Balance Rock Motel 
in Martin, now part of Helper. 
Ross' father, Felice, was a 
well known stone 
mason in the Carbon County area. 
We entered the store, but on one was there. 
After several minutes, as Maria went outside to go next door, Ross appeared. 
I 
greeted him (I have not seen him in many years); he remember me. 
I 
introduced Maria, then Ross told me of his ill health and bad luck regarding 
the removal of his gas tanks. 
He can no longer sell gasoline, which has 
21 
negatively affected his business. 
Economically, it is evident that he is not 
doing well. 
We entered the store and he sat in a 
chair behind the counter, his frail 
health quite apparent . We began to talk, and after about twenty minutes I 
asked if I 
could record the session. 
He agreed. 
Because of ill health, his 
voice is faint . He speaks softly and must sit, often dozing. 
However, at 
eighty-seven he still can remember past events. 
He confirmed for me that the 
G_igl iotti family—was nut-- Si-ci 1 
ian,_zs I ad been led to believe, but from  
Decollatura (Casenoye_•—in—Cal,-a ria 
His father, Felice , 
was a 
prominent stone 
mason, replete with folk tales, especially about the Hiawatha jail, which Ross 
did not confirm . However, he did confirm that Felice had "something" to do 
with the houses on Milano Court. 
Joe  
Milano, a 
blacksmith, sharpened tools 
for Gigliotti , 
and Felice did work for Milano. 
Ross said the third house on 
the right on Bryner Street was also built by his father . Ross mentioned that 
he had a 
twelve pound sledge hammer belonging to Felice . We later went 
outside and I 
photographed it. 
On our way to the outbuilding , 
I 
inquired about the building across the 
street, known as the Gigliott
Bl ock  built by Felice. Ross explained that 
the family had lost the building during the Great Depression , 
and that now it 
is owned by a 
Greek. 
They have been in the process of tearing it down for 
years. 
It was obvious that this disturbs Ross, but that he is reconciled to 
the fact that it may happen. 
Ross talked of his father's "dry wall" work; 
that is, stone work without the use_o _cemPnt_or 
_c_oncrete. He stated that 
Felice did all type of stone work -- walls, mine portals, buildings, houses, 
etc. 
He learned the trade in Italy and plied his craft in Carbon County. 
He 
would contract out to anyone. 
22 
Ross recalled going through Elli_s__I-land 
,_especially_that_they—had_to 
wait for his brother, who was deaf, to clear the authorities. 
They came 
directly to Carbon County. 
He introduced us to his wife Stella Felice, whose father was from 
northern Italy. 
Mrs. Gigliotti is a 
Jehovah Witness and just returned from 
her Sunday meeting in Carbonville. 
Her specific point of reference to an 
Italian background was also founded on food and food preparation. 
We paid for 
two ice cream sandwiches and left. 
Maria noted that they were the only ones 
who did not offer us anything to eat or drink. 
I 
stopped on the hill above 
the complex to take photographs and record the landscape around us. 
We went 
to dinner and called it a 
day. 
I 
worked on field notes.

We got up early, checked out of the motel, and 
drove to Helper for the Labor Day parade, which was to begin at 9:30 a.m. 
Vito Bonacci was to be recognized as one of the oldest union members alive; he 
,joined the UMWA in 1920. 
Helper Main Street was crowded. 
The parade began 
late, as motor cycle policemen cleared both sides of the street. 
Groups and 
floats paraded by with colorful banners and slogans. 
As I 
photographed, I 
was 
especially struck by the Hiawatha Local, which paraded by with men, women, and 
children. 
Clearly, this was to illustrate the fact that unions represented 
families -- in earlier years, union affiliation often meant "repercussions" 
for the family. 
The parade lasted but about forty-five minutes, ending at the 
Helper Park. 
There, the day took on an "old fashioned" picnic character. 
Speakers, food, and games marked the festivities. 
At the park's grandstand, 
Vito Bonacci, and several others, were honored publicly as the oldest members 
23 
of the union. 
Filomena, who had been in the hospital the day before, had 
insisted that Vito attend. 
Indeed, Vito wanted to be present! 
As the 
"oldtimers" walked to the stage, it was clear that Vito was in excellent 
condition in comparison to the others. 
I 
scampered down to the field to take 
photographs, when I 
was approached by a 
union representative, who asked if I 
would be the "official photographer," since their person did not show. 
I 
accepted, commenting that I 
did not have an official "union" card - 
he 
laughed. 
It was discovered that Vito's plaque had been sent to Wyoming by 
mistake, and that someone else's had been sent to Utah. 
Mike Delpiaz, an Italian, is the president of the union and the Mayor of 
Helper -- very appropriate since Helper was often considered the refuge of 
both immigrants and labor. 
He hopes to revitalize the annual labor day event, 
which had alternated between Helper and Price. 
Other unions, such as those 
representing workers at Greyhound and Eastern Airlines also attended in mass. 
The union provided food for members and their families, and there were various 
concession stands. 
Games included arm wrestling, races, and log sawing. 
Maria and I 
left at about 3:00 p.m., driving back to Salt Lake City. 
Later in 
the evening, I 
worked on fieldnotes. 
IAW-PFN-F.101490.A

Maria and I 
left for Carbon County at about 12:00 
Noon (247 miles round trip). 
I 
had been asked by the Stella D'America Lodge 
No. 77 of Helper to deliver the annual Columbus Day Banquet address. 
Stan 
Litizzette called me about three weeks ago and I 
accepted the invitation. 
We 
stopped in on the Bonaccis in Spring Glen and then proceeded to the Carbon 
County Country Club. 
There were about 80 in attendance -- an excellent turn 
24 
out. 
Both the men's and women's (sorelle) chapters were present, and a 
fair 
number of younger people. 
According to president Frank Dalpiaz, only five to 
six men show up regularly for meetings of the lodge. 
However, this annual 
affair in honor of Columbus Day is always "well" attended. 
My presentation 
began with an explanation of the Italians in the West Project sponsored by the 
American Folk Life Center. 
In fact, I 
handed out project brochures to many 
interested people. 
Walter Borla, also in attendance, had a 
stack of brochures 
given to him by Steve Siporin. 
Maria photographed me. 
I 
spoke of the 
Columbian Quincentennary and defined various themes that reflect on the idea 
of discovery and exploration. 
My examples were of Italians in Carbon County -
- 
the ideas of discovery/exploration, immigration, and adaptation. 
I 
spoke of 
the ongoing "connections" between Italian Americans in Carbon County and 
Italians in Italy. 
I 
mentioned examples of specific events and activities 
being documented by the IAW project and how they fit into the overall picture 
of Italians in Carbon County. 
The discussion was well received. 
After my address I 
photographed the crowd. 
Later, Stan Litizzette and 
Frank Dalpiaz offered us an after dinner drink(s). 
While talking I 
reiterated 
the importance of the Manina House and how it should be preserved, with more 
access given. 
Stan came up with the idea of having the Lodge take possession 
of the house, thus insuring its preservation. 
Frank agreed and will talk to 
the current owner. 
We all agreed that this would be an excellent move by the 
Italian Lodge. 
Maria and I 
left for Salt Lake City at about 10:00 p.m., 
arriving home at 12:00 Midnight. 
IAW-PFN-F.102090.A 
-- 
I 
telephoned Mrs. Edith [Verde] Pitts in Price, 
Utah, to inquire more into the history of the Verde home and oven in Helper. 
25 
Jt-
Edith supplied me with the names of her brothers and sisters, which I 
added to 
field notes IAW-PFN-F.082590.A. 
First of all, Edith stated that the family 
name is spelled "Verde." 
She mentioned that family history places the 
building date of the house at 1903. 
It was built by a 
contractor named 
"Leute" from Helper for the Verde family. 
Mr. Verde (Antonio) was working in 
Sunnyside at the time. 
Edith stated that the family lived in Helper in 1900, 
as documented by the census, and that the house burned. 
The family moved to 
Sunnyside, where Antonio worked for Utah Fuel as a 
plumber, but had this house 
built. 
He apparently rented it out, one family was named Bombino, and moved 
his family back to Helper in about 1916. 
This also correlates with the 1910 
census. 
He died in 1916. 
Mrs. Verde died in 1924. 
They have plans of the 
house. 
Edith also believes that it was her brother Tony who built the oven, 
which was used by their mother. 
Willy remembered that the oven was remodeled 
in the 1930s. 
IAW-PFN-F.103190.A 
-- 
I 
wrote some brief sketches of the history of 
•-2 
Milano Court, the Verde Homestead, and ttie_ 
Camillo Manina house to be used by 
Tom Carter as accompanying material for the architectural drawings completed 
by his students. 
They are as follows: 
MILANO COURT 
The five stone houses on Welby Street, also known as Milano Court, were 
all built by Joe Milano in 1911 for use as both family residences and rental 
properties. 
Milano immigrated from Forno Canavese, Province of Torino, 
Piemonte, Italy. 
He married Domenica Bottino in 1900 at Castle Gate and they 
lived in the house at 52 Welby. 
Milano was a 
skilled blacksmith who worked for the coal companies. 
As 
such, he also built a 
blacksmith shop on the property at 52 Welby. 
Much of 
the stonework on these structures is believed to have been done by Felice 
Gigliotti, a 
stone mason from Decollatura, Province of Catanzaro, Calabria, 
26 
Italy. 
Gigliotti, himself a 
well known local stone worker, often traded work 
with Milano, where Joe would sharpen his chisels in exchange for stone work. 
The buildings now remain vacant, but all are excellent examples of the 
work done by Italian stone masons as well as the immigrant enterprising 
spirit. 
` 
THE VERDE HOMESTEAD 
The Antonio and Marie Verde house, baking oven, and yard represent a 
complex of structures important in documenting the folk and daily life of 
Italian immigrants in Carbon County, Utah. 
The house was built in 
approximately 1903 for Antonio Verde by a 
local contractor named Leute. 
Verde 
rented out the structure until the family moved back to Helper from Sunnyside 
in 1916. 
Antonio died in 1916 leaving his wife and children. 
According to family history, it was Tony Verde, born in 1914, who built 
the domed baking oven, much in the style of those found on the Calabrian 
countryside in southern Italy. 
In all probability, Tony learned this 
construction both from his mother and other local immigrants familiar with 
this type of "forno." 
Willy, the youngest of the Verde sons, recalled doing 
some repair work on the oven in the 1930s. 
It has remained basically the same 
since then, but has not been in use for "many" years. 
The yard, complete with a 
smoke house, wine preparation shed, rabbit 
hutches, and vegetable and spice gardens remain in the Verde family. 
4`- 
CAMILLO MANINA HOUSE 
The Camillo Manina house was constructed in the late 1920s and early 
1930s by Camillo Manina, Domenic Conca, John Manina, and Virginio Marzo. 
Its 
design and use of stone was typical to housing in Manina's native village of 
Novalesa, Province of Torino, Piemonte, Italy. 
Designed by Manina, the 
residence was erected first with the use of stone gather in the Spring Glen 
area and cut by the team of men in the fashion of old world masonry. 
Such 
rock work is a 
hall mark of Italian craftsmanship evident throughout Carbon 
County. 
During the second stage of construction, Manina and the others used 
brick from the demolished Denver & 
Rio Grande Western Railroad's roundhouse at 
Helper. 
The stone retaining wall at the front of the house and the steps 
leading up to it were added later by Manina and Conca. 
Camillo farmed his land when work as a 
coal miner slowed. 
The use of 
terracing and the presence of a 
wide variety of fruit trees also attests to 
Manina's maintenance of Italian cultural values and traditions.

I 
worked all day in preparing my field notes and 
research materials to send to David Taylor. 
They will be sent to Steve 
Siporin, who can then send all the materials to David Taylor. 
As part of my 
review, all of the words in "Calabrese" were checked in a 
dictionary of the 
dialect. 
27 
Included in my research material are two video tapes. 
The first, 
labeled "IAW-PFN-VIDEO #1," was taken at All State Italian Day on 12 August 
1990 by Louie Notarianni. 
This video highlights the day's events, including 
the boccie tournament and Carlo Terzo describing his wine making. 
The second 
tape, "IAW-PFN-VIDEO #2," was made in August 1989 in Calabria, Italy by Philip 
F. and Maria T. Notarianni. 
This is the tape that was played to Vito and 
Filomena Bonacci in the presence of Phil & 
Maria Notarianni, and Steve Siporin 
(see IAW-PFN-F.080290.C). 
Italian relavtives of the Bonaccis, Vincenzo and 
Marietta DiFazio, sent their greetings and describe some family business being 
transacted by Vincenzo. 
In addition, the video also contains some footage of 
a 
brief interview with Raffaele Scalzo, who lived in Carbon County from 1920-
1926, and helped Frank Bonacci with unionizing efforts. 
Mr. Scalzo tells of 
the hardships suffered by Frank Bonacci and his family. 
The entire tape 
documents some of the festivals, religious, and folk customs of Calabria.
