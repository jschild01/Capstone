MALE VOICE:  Cameras rolling.  Ready  
01:00:01 
to roll.  
INTERVIEWER:  Mr. Guyot, thanks for 
doing this interview.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  It's a pleasure.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Now you were born and 
grew up in Pass Christian, 
Mississippi, and you said that racial 
prejudice by and large did not affect 
you during your youth?  How could 
that be so in Mississippi at that age  
01:00:17 
in time? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  I came from the most non- 
Mississippi-like section of 
Mississippi.  It was a heavy Catholic 
influence.  Ingalls Shipyard was 
producing most of the major armaments 
for all hostilities in Pascagoula, 
hiring people from 63 counties.  You 
had the labor union influence; you 
had the Catholic Church influence,  
01:00:40 
which was tremendous; and you had a 
population of 100,000 white people, 
19,000 black people.

The Catholic Church in 1957 or '58 
made a decision that they were going  
01:00:56 
to desegregate the schools.  They did 
it this way.  The announcement was we 
have two programs.  We have 
excommunication and we have 
integration.  Make your choice by 
Friday.  Now there was violence going 
on in Louisiana.  Nothing happened on 
the Gulf Coast.  I learned firsthand 
that institutions can really have an 
impact on social policy.   
01:01:21 
I bought three slot machines, Julian, 
because there was a lot of gambling 
on the Gulf Coast.  I just passed the 
academic test for entrance into 
Tougaloo College.  I was going to be 
sent to jail by Gaston Hughes 
[phonetic].  My father hires Bidwell 
Adams to represent me.  Bidwell Adams 
is the lieutenant governor under 
Bilbo.  He is the chairman of the  
01:01:49 
Democratic Party in the State of 
Mississippi, and he's a lawyer who 
represents black people who've been

accused of raping white women.  
 
We go to his office and my father  
01:01:59 
says here's the problem.  Bilbo said, 
"Don't worry about it."  He calls up 
Gaston Hughes.  He said, "No, this 
boy is not black.  He's a Creole."  I 
didn't correct him, Julian.  He then 
said, "This boy is going off to 
school.  I don't want to hear anymore 
about these slot machines."  Gaston 
said I'm going to send him to 
Parchman.  Bilbo says okay.  I  
01:02:21 
looked at my father; we must be in 
the wrong place.  He continued.  He 
says, "Okay, but if I hear anymore 
about these slot machines, I'm going 
to call for a federal investigation 
of all gambling on the Gulf Coast, 
and I'm going to make sure that 
everyone knows that you caused it."  
 
At the time of this meeting I was 17 
years old.  I'm now 71 years of age.   
01:02:41 
I've never heard about those slot 
machines and I've never heard about 
anyone who's heard about those slot

I come out of a family--my 
grandfather's brother was chairman of 
the Republican Party in Hancock 
County for 65 years.  He died at 105  
01:03:35 
years of age.  His name is Louis 
Piernas.  He and I talked about

civil war fought on the beaches of  
01:03:51 
Bay St. Louis, not far from Waverley 
[phonetic] where we used to go down 
to meet."  He talked about, "My wife 
and I did a genealogy study.  We run 
across a WPA interview of him."  He 
says, "Well, Bilbo is really terrible 
and I just hope that blacks will be 
able to fight there way into the 
Democratic Party."  I got chills up 
my spine.  I said, "That's what I've  
01:04:13 
been doing." 
 
My family was very, very political.  
My grandfather was a man who taught 
me the value of listening.  Long 
before communalism was what it is 
today, he had a lot of Baptist 
ministers as friends.  They would 
meet outside every Sunday and they 
would decide what they would go in 
and convince him of.  I knew who was  
01:04:40 
going to win this argument.  They 
would come out convinced that they 
had convinced my grandfather.  They

were satisfied that he understood 
them and he agreed with them.  I knew  
01:04:53 
that when I talked to him about it 
afterwards, that it had gone just the 
other way.  
 
He had one habit, Julian.  If you 
went to him and said, "Mr. Joos 
[phonetic], I'm going fishing," he 
would repeat the word "fishing".  I 
said, "Grandpa, you're too smart to 
do that.  I've seen the people you 
talk to."  He said, "Boy, it gives me  
01:05:14 
a little bit more time to think about 
what I'm going to say.  From that day 
on, Julian, I never questioned my 
grandfather.  
 
He and I read the newspaper together 
every day.  We also listened to two 
people on the radio.  Whenever FDR 
spoke, he gathered the family to 
listen to our president.  Another guy 
was Ronald Reagan.  
01:05:32

liked his style.  We didn't like his

how he did it.  I mean he could paint

the pictures.   
 
I'm 7 years old.  He takes me in 
front of the Catholic Church in 
Mississippi in St. Philomena's.  I 
read Paul's letters to the Galatians 
and Ephesians.  I'm just proud.  I'm 
with my grandfather; I can read 
before my congregation; I can do 
anything.  I learned from my family 
the value of service and the  
01:06:12 
interrelationship between religion 
and politics.   
 
My father was a man who would've made 
Lyndon Johnson look like a pica if he 
could've just gotten the kind of 
political opportunities that I had.  
My father got in a contest one time 
about a mathematics problem.  
Everyone in the town told him that he 
was wrong, that he had figured out  
01:06:38 
wrong.  They sent back to the book

mistake.  He's right."  
 
He's a man who when he got into a  
01:06:47 
jewelry, a woman wanted to get $6,000 
from an insurance company.  Everybody 
in the jewelry store said, "That…"  
My father said, "Send out and get a 
lot of coffee because until she gets 
her $6,000, we're not going to decide 
anything.  
 
I saw my father, Julian, beat one of 
the richest men in Pass Christian 
almost to a pulp in front of the post

office with his fist and then take me 
by the hand and walk me home.  I come 
from a city that as the Catholic 
Church had desegregated, I could use 
any restaurant I wanted.  I could go 
into any drug store I wanted.  I 
could ride on the bus anywhere.  I 
was a longshoreman at 13.  I used the 
white restroom on the Gulf Coast.

father would've killed any 20 people  
01:07:51 
that had anything to say to me. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Didn't you know that 
there was a great difference between 
where you lived in Mississippi and 
the rest of Mississippi?  How did you 
balance in your mind the fact that 
you were able to do these things 
here, but just a few miles away you 
would take your life in your hands to 
do them? 
01:08:09 
MR. GUYOT:  What really brought this 
home to me was I went to Tougaloo 
College.  Tougaloo College was 
threatened with extinction by the 
State Legislature.  It had an 
interracial faculty.  It was 
perfectly designed for me.  I needed 
to be some place that was 
academically free, that would be 
committed to social change, and that  
01:08:29 
would be committed to empowerment and 
the development of leadership.  
Tougaloo was all of that.  When I get

there I meet Ed King.  I meet David 
Broder [phonetic].  I meet Ernest  
01:08:40 
Borinski [phonetic].  Ernest Borinski 
is a Jew driven out of Germany.  He 
comes to Tougaloo.  He becomes an 
institution man.  He develops a 
theory that some institutions are 
functional only by their absence of 
function.  That's the Democratic 
Party in Mississippi.  It only needs 
to be organized every four years.  
They go to a convention; they come  
01:09:02 
back; and then it disbands.  If they 
don't disband, then they have to 
answer people's problems.  You can 
run the state apparatus without doing 
that.  
 
I meet A.A. Branch.  A.A. Branch is a 
member of the leadership of the YMCA.  
A.A. Branch says to us the policy of 
Tougaloo is you can become involved 
in any demonstration you want around  
01:09:27 
voting.  We're going to assist you in 
doing that, but take your books with 
you.  We're going to test you just

like everyone else.  Only Tougaloo 
College and Miles College did that.   
01:09:37 
No other college in the South or in 
America did that to my knowledge.   
 
I'm in the perfect place for me.  I 
meet people who are committed to 
nonviolence.  I meet John Salter, who 
teaches me everything I need to know 
about socialism.  A.A. Branch is a 
leader of the YWCA, but as A.A.

He wasn't a student there, but I

later becomes a member of the State 
Supreme Court. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  I know this is 
counterfactual, but what if you had 
gone to Jackson State instead of 
Tougaloo?  How would Lawrence Guyot 
have turned out do you think?  
 
MR. GUYOT:  I don't think I would've

lasted at Jackson State.  I believe I 
come from a town that created a 
certain political expectation of what 
was expected of me by my family and 
by my church.  I wouldn't have fit 
into the strict, rigid conformity and 
hierarchal leadership of Jackson 
State.  Dorie Ladner and Joyce Ladner 
went there first.  They had to leave 
there and come to Tougaloo.  Tougaloo

was an Oasis in the State of 
Mississippi.  It was committed to

growth, and to leadership.  Its very 
existence was threatened by the state  
01:11:55 
legislature, but they continued to 
move ahead. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Again, let me back up a 
little bit.  I was just thinking 
about Pass Christian and the 
community you grew up in, the 
Catholic Church's influence, and the 
influence of labor unions.  Most of 
Mississippi doesn't have this.  Most 
of the South doesn't have this.  
01:12:12 
MR. GUYOT:  That's right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  It's only when you get 
into Louisiana that there's any real 
Catholic presence.  Outside of your 
section of Mississippi, probably not 
much any place else.  The same would 
be true of Alabama, Georgia, and so 
on.  Do you ever consider how lucky 
you were to run into the Catholic 
Church and to live in a community  
01:12:30 
where labor unions flourished?

thing to it and I'll respond to your

01:12:40 
Yes.  I consider myself very 
fortunate.  I was born in the right 
town.  I get to go to the right 
church.  I get to go to the right 
college.  Then I run into SNCC.  I 
come from a family that understands.   
 
In 1964 my favorite uncle says me the 
mayor wants to meet with you about 
the Summer Project.  I grew walk up 
the steps to his house.   
01:13:12 
He said but I don't want you to call 
him from my house.  My uncle's scared 
about being tied to this.  But I go 
down and talk to the mayor.  I said 
here's what we're going to do.  He 
said here's what we're going to do.  
That's it.  I give no quarter.  They 
give no quarter.  This is '64.   
 
Then in '66 that same uncle runs for 
Alderman in Pass Christian.  You get

Rights Act.

you ran into SNCC.  Tell me about 
running into SNCC.  How did that  
01:13:49 
happen?  Who embodied SNCC for you? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  Dorie Ladner, Joyce 
Ladner, and Bob Moses.  I meet Bob 
Moses, John Doar, and Marion Barry 
all at the same time.  They come out 
of McComb.  We're all working at 714 
Rose Street.  There we have Moses, 
the Ladners, Bevel [phonetic], Diane, 
quite a few other folks, Lavon Brown, 
Sheila Michaels.  This is the Freedom  
01:14:25 
House, right?   
 
From there, we move into the Delta.  
We go to Amzie Moore's house.  Amzie

timing in her speech pattern.  She 
can weave together three different  
01:15:08 
issues and collapse them in 25 words 
and bring it all together.  She's a 
woman who walks into churches and who 
takes over.  If the minister is a 
good minister, she treats him as a 
good minister.  If he's wavering, she 
preaches to him before his 
congregation and nobody says a word 
to her.   
 
Here we get the perfect melding of  
01:15:36 
religious fundamentalism and 
pragmatic politics.  Not only does 
she go to register to vote, but as 
you know, she becomes a national 
celebrity.  She becomes a woman who 
Andy Young takes to meet with Senator 
Church when he wants to talk about 
Vietnam.  She's one of the founders 
of the National Women's Political 
Caucus.  She's the woman who speaks  
01:16:00 
at the '64 Democratic Convention.  
Lyndon Johnson calls a press 
conference to interrupt her.

At that time, there was only ABC, 
NBC, and CBS, and they all play her  
01:16:12 
speech in its entirety that evening.  
Then there are 1,200 telegrams saying 
to seek the Freedom Democratic Party.  
Then Lyndon has to apply pressure 
because Lyndon says--and he says it 
in his tapes--the good thing about 
Lyndon is we got tapes on him.  
Lyndon says, "Look, we can't have a 
floor fight to seat an all-white 
delegation and then go and ask black  
01:16:40 
people to vote for us in November, so 
the floor fight must be stopped."  
Then as President of the United 
States, he pulled out all of the 
stops.  Delegates from California, 
one of them was told, "Your husband 
can be a federal judge.  All you have 
to do is stop voting for the Freedom 
Democratic Party."  Candidates in New 
York were told, "You all have a lot

They went to the delegates in  
01:17:11 
California.  Unfortunately, the 
California Democratic Party had 
passed the delegation supporting 
their position.  But the President 
put all of his pressure on all of 
them.  As you know, we couldn't get 
the floor fight.  Not being able to 
get the floor fight, we were then 
offered a compromise of two people.   
 
I'm proud of the fact that I'm the

Democratic Party.  I'm in jail in 
Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  I couldn't 
have given a speech as good as Fannie 
Lou Hamer did.  I couldn't have led 
the Freedom Democratic Party into 
making what I considered the most 
courageous, pragmatic, political 
decision in American politics.  They 
said to this compromise, "No."

no delegation went to the '64 
Democratic Convention who understood 
the relationship between dying and 
the right to vote.  Every one of 
these people had lost money, had 
served time in jail, had had their 
names posted in the newspaper when 
they registered to vote.  They were 
willing to take on the strongest

and they were willing to go into 
Lyndon Johnson's convention and fight

off the charts on everything except

Because I understood the universality

judiciary had framed that.  I 
understood the Brown case.  I 
understood the Baker vs. Carr now 
opened up the political arena to the

courts, which meant that there would 
be more power.  History proves me 
right on that.  We have reached a

INTERVIEWER:  You mentioned a moment 
ago about running into Bob Moses and 
the Ladner sisters and so on, and 
finding this community of people who 
make up the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating Committee.  What did you 
think of them?  What was your 
impression of them and how in your  
01:20:21 
mind did they differ from the run-of-
the-mill college students and others 
you were associated with? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  I thought that these were 
people who had a religious commitment 
to interracialism; that they were 
fundamentally about change; that they 
were different from the other 
organizers that I'd been exposed to 
in that they were not about creating  
01:20:44 
membership.  They were about creating 
empowerment.  That is what fascinated 
me.  Here were people who were very

well educated who could think on 
their feet, who were interdependent,  
01:21:02 
and who had fierce respect for one 
another.   
 
Once I saw how they operated, then I 
was totally captivated.  Their 
position was that they were going to 
work with established leaders who 
were there: E.W. Steptoe; later 
Hartman Turnbow.  They go into 
McComb.  I don't go into McComb.  
SNCC is almost killed, almost shot

that the black community will protect

people learn?  Don't go to jail.

fight because what we were able to do 
in Greenwood was force the Department  
01:23:07 
of Justice.  Once the voter 
registration workers got arrested 
there, John Doar says, "Okay, we're 
going into court," but instead of 
filing a type A suit, he files a type 
B suit, which just gets us out.   
 
What we found was that the Department 
of Justice to this day defends their 
position by saying we didn't want to 
occupy Leflore County.   
01:23:38 
Remember, while this was going on 
there was also the case of Ole Miss 
and there was the case of Theron 
Lynd.   
 
I think one of the major achievements 
of SNCC was to bring about a working 
relationship with the Department of 
Justice.  We trained them.  We took 
John Doar to Walthall County.  We 
introduced John Doar to a man named  
01:24:06 
John Hardy.  John Hardy was a SNCC 
activist who brought some people in 
to register to vote.  Mr. Woods, the

said, "Wait a minute.  We're going to 
stop this prosecution.  The reason 
we're stopping it is when you hit

Not because of the department itself, 
but because somebody like John Doar 
stood out among his fellows and 
pushed hard for these kinds of 
remedies.

field, finding out where the danger

that.  There's no question.  John 
Doar participates not only in that, 
but John Doar also, when the 
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party 
files the first private lawsuit under 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  John 
Doar and the Department of Justice

day forward anyone who's aggrieved by 
Section 5 has the right to bring a 
lawsuit under Section 5.  You see the 
range that they're giving it?  They 
broadened Section 5.  They give us 
the best possible interpretation we

can.  Now this case is my idea.  I

I'd been trained well enough to know 
that if you had the choice between 
trained by being given guidance by a 
thief or by a bishop, choose the 
thief.  The bishop will tell you no; 
this is not right.  The thief will 
tell you this is how I did it and 
this is how I've stopped other people

possibility of diluting the Voting 
Rights Act must either be pre-cleared

What I found was that I knew that I 
wasn't going to get out of Winona 
alive.  I didn't think any of us that

other people from across the country 
started calling in to ask to speak to 
us, that let them know that other 
people know.   
 
Number two, the assassination of 
Medgar Evers.  I'd been beaten quite 
a few other times, but what one time 
that I remember vividly that I wasn't 
beaten, but I think it's something I 
want to talk about now, we were  
01:31:00 
driving in a car from Hattiesburg, 
Jackson, and it was a car that 
couldn't go over 50 miles an hour.  
It had bad tires.  Some people with 
shotguns were behind us.  I said stop 
the car.  I got out, I walked back, 
and I looked in the…  I said, "Look, 
the FBI's been following us.  If you 
want to go to jail for 10 years, just 
do anything to anybody in that car."  
01:31:25 
Those good old boys turned around and 
then we got back in the car.  He

right into terror.  What did she mean 
by that?  
 
MR. GUYOT:  She said that at a dinner 
that was given in my name here in 
Washington.  The way she laid it out 
was she said, "Look, all black 
southern men were told to stay out of

jail."  If your friends are in jail, 
send them money, pray for them, but 
don't go visit them."  Here was man

operated in Mississippi with SNCC-- 
NAACP, SCLC, and SNCC?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  The NAACP took the 
position--and I'm quoting Roy Wilkins 
who said part of this on the great 
documentary "Eyes on the Prize"--
Mississippi is a bestial state.  It 
should be cut off and allowed to be 
drifted to sea.  He didn't say this

on camera, but he said it later.

crazy.  Were going to raise money out

INTERVIEWER:  Why is there this 
dichotomy between Martin Luther King, 
the head of SCLC, and SCLC?  Why is 
he behaving in one way and the 
organization is behaving in another 
way? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  Well, I'll tell you why.  
I think what he appreciated was the  
01:34:52 
freedom and the creativity of what 
was going on in Mississippi.  Here we 
were sending a message to the country 
that if you allow us to vote in 
Mississippi unimpeded, we will do it.  
80,000 people backed that up.  We 
said about '64 Summer Project we 
can't bring Mississippi to America, 
but we can bring America to 
Mississippi.  We found out we could  
01:35:20 
not protect ourselves.  We're going

nationalize this problem.   
 
We then challenged the Democratic 
Party in Atlantic City.  We were

Garrow is the chronicle of Martin 
Luther, makes the point that the  
01:36:29 
Freedom Democratic Party in this 
memorandum had a larger impact on the 
Voting Rights Act than did Selma.  
David Garrow says it.   
 
This all happened because of a guy 
named Michael Thelwell.  Michael 
Thelwell gets a chance to attend the 
leadership conference meetings.  When 
you read the first proposal for the 
Voting Rights Act, it's as weak as  
01:36:53 
can be.  You would need 20 complaints 
and the president may authorize.  We 
needed a greater trigger mechanism.  
Section 5 was that trigger mechanism, 
but Section 5 wouldn't have been 
created unless we brought the 
congressional challenge.  We got 149 
congressmen to say yes, the 
congressional delegation from 
Mississippi, GBC.

did is now being done by those three  
01:39:18 
groups and the young people's project 
headed by Moses' children.  They are 
doing the kind of organizing we did.

willing to risk their lives and their

children's lives and everything they 
have, and you can't do it secretly, 
that's success.  That's called real 
political mobilization.   
 
I think from January 23rd to 26th, 
the people who created this, the 
veterans of the civil rights movement 
in Mississippi were meeting.  
Yesterday I read in the Washington 
Post about civil rights activist

those people to come down?  As far as 
I'm concerned, the greatest

Mississippi and SNCC.  Who do you 
compare us to?

is this so?  Why is it such a failure 
of our community to mobilize in the  
01:41:26 
way we did when we were young people 
and a little more vigorous than we 
are now? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  Let me give you what is 
the most logical and most practical 
answer.  We're now given the perfect 
solution, the perfect opportunity 
that brings us back to that period.  
If we allow the Republicans to have 
control of the house and the senate,  
01:41:51 
except for the next two years--they 
don't control the senate--then we 
must forever write off that whole 
beautiful mantra that we created 
before then.  It's very clear.  
 
I'm astounded that the political 
commentators look at a sense of 
equivalence between the Republican 
Party and the Democratic Party.  
There is none.  The Republican Party  
01:42:19 
is by definition obstructionist and 
wants to narrow the scope and 
function of government.  The

Democratic Party wants to do just the 
converse.  
01:42:30 
We now have a golden opportunity to 
fight for what we have because it's 
all on the table, everything you can 
imagine, given the Republican's need 
to destroy America as we know it.  We 
can prevent them.  A million of us 
who voted in 2008 didn't vote in the 
midterm elections.  What we've got to 
do now is use all of our resources.  
For the next two years, I'm going to  
01:43:00 
do nothing but push books, the mantra 
of SNCC, the example of SNCC as an 
organizing vehicle, and I'm going to 
call on everyone who participated in 
the Freedom Elections, in the Freedom 
Riots, in the Summer Project.  You 
name them.  It's time for action now.  
 
The reason I can do that with 
confidence is there's a difference 
between people who have made change  
01:43:26 
and there's a difference to people 
who have written about change.  We 
are those who made change.  We now

don't act now, it's all lost.

in empowering people?  Our position 
was SNCC people were capable.  One or  
01:45:21 
two SNCC people would go into a town, 
get it organized in two weeks, and 
find a place to stay, all on a salary 
of $10 a week when it was available.   
 
We wanted to facilitate that as much 
as possible.  We had to stay in tough 
with the political news.  What was 
happening on the other side?  How did 
we respond to it?  What kind of 
pressure release is there?  Then we'd  
01:45:45 
call you and Mary King and others 
when we needed help.  It meant 
setting up meetings, carrying out 
meetings, and improving the skills of 
the leadership that was there.  
 
Harry Bowie and I traveled the state 
of Mississippi.  Bowie was a black 
Episcopalian, one of the most 
brilliant men I've ever met.  He 
worked for the Delta Ministry.  The  
01:46:07 
Delta Ministry was organized because 
I invited all religious groups to 
come to Hattiesburg in '63.  When

SNCC leaves Mississippi in '66, 
they're replaced by the Delta  
01:46:19 
Ministry.   
 
The new ally for the Freedom 
Democratic Party is the Delta 
Ministry.  They support the 
Children's Defense Fund.  The 
Children's Defense Fund headed by 
Edelman hires 3,000 people in 
Mississippi.  That instantly becomes 
a negative attraction to Senator 
Stennis, and he must be killed, so  
01:46:44 
there's an attempt to destroy it.  
 
It is the ability of SNCC to continue 
to bring in forces to be used in its 
political methodology.  We bring in 
the Lawyer's Committee for Civil 
Rights under the law.  I'm proud of 
the fact that they were to the left 
and we got castigated for that.  I 
remember when Dave Dennis, Bob Moses, 
and I met with Counselor Canoy  
01:47:20 
[phonetic] and others.  I said, "Do 
you all agree that we will make the 
decisions and you all do the

litigating?"  They said yes, and they 
never deviated from that.  
01:47:36 
I'm very proud that SNCC took the 
position that we were not going to 
let anyone tell us what to do.  I 
remember after Kennedy was killed 
there was a request by Lyndon Johnson 
that there be a moratorium on 
demonstrations.  Theodore White had 
written a book saying that SNCC was 
really communist, really dangerous 
people.   
01:48:01 
We analyzed that we had a conference 
at Howard University.  Bayard Rustin 
spoke there.  Baldwin spoke there.  
The great socialist Norman Thomas 
spoke there.  Norman Thomas said, 
"Look, we can't win by singing, but 
we can't win unless we sing."  He 
said, "You must understand.  Every 
program that we came up with, the 
Democrats litigated, turned into  
01:48:32 
laws."  The question was: would we be 
part of the nullification?  We said 
no.  We're going to have a Summer

Summer Project was not universally  
01:8:49 
accepted.  Fannie Lou Hamer and I 
were two of the few people that 
supported it originally.  Once Bob 
Moses comes back from McComb, when 
one of the witnesses was killed that 
evening, that witness to the Herbert 
Lee killing. He then throws his 
weight behind-- 
 
INTERVIEWER:  Louis Allen.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  Louis Allen.  He then  
01:49:05 
throws his weight behind Summer 
Project, and it happens.  I think the 
Summer Project was one of the most 
creative, indigenous, empowering, 
nationalizing activities.  It 
couldn't have been pulled off by 
anyone but SNCC.  SNCC was not 
answerable to anyone who could tell 
it anything.  When we pulled off the 
Freedom Election, the Voter Education  
01:49:38 
Project said we can no longer fund 
you all.

Brown was there.  What it served as 
is a reconciliation post for everyone  
01:50:29 
arrested in the Freedom Riots.  
Because when you got arrested in the 
Freedom Riots, you were tried in 
Jackson.  When you came to Jackson, 
you came to 714 Rose Street.   
 
Then we acquainted you with what was 
going on in the state and how you 
could be helpful when you went back 
to wherever you were.  It was this 
cross-fertilization of activism that  
01:50:51 
was uninhibited, that was indigenous, 
that was empowering, and that was 
answerable to no one.  We were able 
to creatively involve all the major…

committed once they come to

They also join us when we challenge

"What can we do about the  
01:51:30 
congressional challenge?"  They said, 
"What you can do is open doors.  
Where we don’t have a civil rights 
movement, we have churches."  James 
Farmer of CORE and I got to talk to 
Forwood [phonetic], who later becomes 
President Forwood because his bishop 
called him and said you got to talk 
to him. 
 
What we found is that the labor

to give you a contribution of 
$25,000, and we're going to send for 
Board of Directors to tell you what 
to do."  You can imagine how long 
that lasted. 
 
Then if you look at when the Summer 
Project was agreed to, some people

said to us, "William Sloane Coffin 
has to head this."  It never 
happened, Julian.  Then you remember

They said no.  What we found was that 
we were creating something in

worst, then you create a political

Curtis Gaines, who is one of the top 
demographers of the vote ever year  
01:55:31 
wrote a letter in 1965.  He said, 
"I've toured the South and if this 
SNCC MFDP kind of operation is 
allowed to happen in the South, it 
will not be loyal to the National 
Democratic Party.  This letter is 
written in its entire in Local People 
by John Dittmer.  I got it, I gave it 
to Dittmer, and he put it in the 
book.  He said what we must do is  
01:3:58 
quickly pass the Voting Rights Act so 
we can then bring blacks into the 
Democratic Party.  I just wanted to 
say that to say, "Look at how many 
other forces we were resonating with, 
and they put their own interpretation 
on it."   
The NEA and AFT both send 
representatives to the Summer Project

discussion about the curriculum for

There's this tremendous infusion of 
bringing the political process to the 
average citizen.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  After '64, did you 
leave Mississippi?  When did you move 
to D.C.? 
 
MR. GUYOT:  I moved to D.C. in 1968.  
I was a delegate to the Democratic 
convention in '68.  Harry Bowie and I 
organized.  What happened was this.   
01:55:08 
The loyalists thought that they would 
become part of the regular Democratic 
Party.  Bidwell Adams, my dear 
friend, was chairing the state 
convention.  He said, "Look, if you 
don't desegregate this delegation, 
you're wasting your bus fare to 
Chicago."  We waited for that to 
happen.  Aaron Henry and the 
loyalists, who were set up as an  
01:55:29 
alternative to destroy MFDP, they 
were unsuccessful.  
Then I said to them, "Let's join

together."  The loyalists hooked up 
with the MFDP.  We got 50% of the  
01:55:40 
delegation; they got 50%; and we were 
seated in '68.  Harry Bowie and I met 
with Charles Evers and Harding 
Carter.  They looked at the names.  
They said, "How did you all do it?"  
I said, "Well, look; you all had the 
money.  You all had the prestige.  We 
knew all of these people years before 
they knew you."  We went up and 
selected, nominated, and we got Ms.

people.

MR. GUYOT:  I had a good time up 
here.  I began to fight for the same-
sex marriage.  I began to fight for 
having the first presidential primary 
in Washington so we could point out

have congressional or senatorial 
representation.  We get the first

Then I publicly lambast them for

supported the write-in.  I remember 
in 1968 and you remember I'm sure  
01:57:51 
when we made a decision to move from 
the civil rights movement to carry 
the church with us into the political 
arena.  We said we're not going to 
hate people, and we're going to 
choose the ballot instead.  The bible 
and the ballot infusion.   
 
Then I see a campaign that to me was 
the real implementation of more hate 
than I've ever seen in my life.   
01:58:19 
Fenty was not only defeated; he was 
turned into a hate caricature.  
Because of that, I joined him in the 
write-in.  Of all the things I've 
done politically, I'm just as proud 
of that.  One of the things I 
understand there very clearly, if 
black people ever make the mistake of 
separating our politics from our 
religion, we're damn not finished.

opponents is Walter Fauntroy, who's

MR. GUYOT:  Well, I think one of the 
best movements in that position is my

Washington in '67.  She supports me 
in everything I've done.  She gets

with me in Mississippi.  We live 
together in Mississippi.  My wife is 
white.  Whenever I've gone to the 
hospital, she's come with me.  Quite

those who are bound, it doesn’t tell 
you to find out what the charges are.  
Whenever you attempt to do any of 
those three, you enter into the  
02:00:33 
political arena.  That's all right 
because there's no other way to do 
it. 
 
I teach political empowerment.  The 
first question I ask of my class is 
let's talk about something that's not 
political.  Once we've gotten through 
that, then we go on to the question.  
What are you doing to enhance your 
political mobility and motility in  
02:00:56 
options? 
 
I was thinking as you were talking 
there about the years we've known

person.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  I understand.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Probably I don't know 
that side of you at all well.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  That's understandable.  
I'm not offended by that at all.  I'm 
very happy with my relationship.  I 
remember when you would share your 
poems early in SNCC.  We both love 
books and we both are very proud of  
02:01:26 
what we've done.  
 
I learned that we must be able to 
ethically transcend ourselves and put 
ourselves in other fellows' shoes, 
and then make a judgment.  I have no 
problems.  I testified before the 
city council and I said, "I'm 
astounded by people wanting to vote 
on denying other people human 
rights."  I said, "We didn't  
02:01:57 
sacrifice lives for that."  The vote 
should be used to build, to 
strengthen.  It should be used

affirmatively.  Quite a few people 
agreed with me on that.   
02:02:11 
I think the beauty of politics, even 
though it has a bad name right now, 
will be revived.  In order to save 
this country, we're going to have to 
revive it.  I look at it as a good 
joining.  As long as you have a 
country in which 6 out of 10 people 
don't know the difference between the 
various layers of government, how can 
you really create public opinion  
02:02:43 
about affirmative and moving?   
 
Jefferson said it very clear.  He 
said in order to have a Republican 
style of government, you've got to 
have an informed election.  My dear 
friend, we have a most tragically and 
misinformed electorate right now.

NAACP led.  He worked very closely 
with Edgar Evers and he worked very 
closely with Ed King.

INTERVIEWER:  John Doar.  We  
01:01:44 
mentioned him a bit.  Tell us a 
little bit more about John Doar. 
 
MR. GUYOT:  John Doar is a hero of 
the civil rights movement.  He is 
best characterized as a man who was a 
relentless worker who didn't stick to 
the script, who was responsible for 
moving the Department of Justice into 
civil rights vigorously.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  He's an assistant  
01:02:12 
attorney general. 
 
MR. GUYOT:  He was the assistant 
attorney general to Robert Kennedy, 
who was the U.S. Attorney General.  
John Doar was a Republican, very 
perceptive, very creative.  I watched 
John Doar represent the government in 
the case of Schwerner, Chaney, and 
Goodman.  He quoted [background 
noise].  He said people will little  
01:02:42 
note here what we say, but they will 
long note what we do.  Of course, 
those people were convicted.'

John Doar, and I'm going to quote 
him, in 1967 was at a conference at  
01:02:59 
Ole Miss and he was talking about the 
press and the civil rights movement.  
He said the Voting Rights Act was 
passed in two cities, McComb, and the 
streets of Greenwood.  What we were 
able to do was convince John Doar and 
others that illiterates had the right 
to vote.  We convinced them.  We got 
that written into the Voting Rights 
Act.   
01:03:22 
Katzenbach, who was then testifying 
before judiciary committee said, "I'm 
convinced of the constitutionality of 
all of this except the right of

people brought in from across the 
country, from various states at 
various times to come in and listen 
to the activists in Mississippi, find 
out what's going on, find out what 
they can do.  Then they would leave 
and go back to their hometowns and

MR. GUYOT:  Joyce and Dorie Ladner

They are related to Vernon Dahmer, 
who is a real civil rights hero.  
They're related to Medgar Evers.  
They're related to Victoria Gray, who 
is the National Committee woman of  
01:05:06 
the Freedom Democratic Party, who was 
also very active in SCLC.  Victoria 
Gray goes to SCLC and gives a great 
speech in Abernathy.  Okay, Victor, 
what do you want?  He said I want 
$7,000 for the Freedom Democratic 
Party and the right check.   
 
Victoria Gray was another religious 
fanatic.  We had one in Fannie Lou 
Hamer and had another in Victoria

activist, who brings in her family.

Theron Lynd is tried by the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Hattiesburg.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  He's the registrar in 
Forest County.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  He's the registrar in 
Forest County.  He takes the position 
that he's not--Julian, he turned down 
postgraduate degree people because 
they said, "You just didn't complete  
01:06:04 
the test right." 
 
There's a great book written about 
him.  It's called "Count them One by 
One."  It's written by one of the 
attorneys who operated in that state.  
Why is it a great book?  Because it 
talks about the trying of Theron Lynd 
for contempt.  It talks about the 
courage of the witnesses who 
participate in that.  It establishes  
01:06:39 
a basis, as does the office and I 
totally agree, for really passing the 
Voting Rights Act.  It was very clear

they were recalcitrants of this 
registrar, which was also analogous

INTERVIEWER:  --and now hopefully  
01:07:46 
was back in those days.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  The Fifth Circuit was 
made up of the most creative group of 
people who were committed to making 
the law useful for social and 
political change.  Ironically, these 
were all Eisenhower appointees.  Each 
one of them files challenge 
delegations in their states, 
Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas.  They  
01:08:19 
won those positions, which helped 
Eisenhower get the presidency.  
 
Eisenhower said to them, "What do you 
all want?"  They wanted to get on the 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  They 
established a legend of expanding the 
constitutional rights of everyone 
that came before them.  Their 
position on the City of Jackson was 
that Jackson had an apartheid policy  
01:08:49 
that was incomparable of anywhere 
else in the United States.  That was 
the official position of the 5th

Circuit.   
 
They validated the removal of cases  
01:09:00 
filed by Arthur Canoy, and they were 
later overturned by the Supreme Court 
and narrowed.  They validated all 
Section 5 cases.  John Doar simply 
had to get to New Orleans, bring the 
case, and it was won.  They 
overturned decision after decision by 
Judge Cox, who was an atrocious 
racist, who talked about black people 
registering to vote as a bunch of  
01:09:28 
chimpanzees.  Once we got to the 
Fifth Circuit, he was overturned.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  One of them you 
mentioned, however, Griffin Bell, 
voted against me and kept me out of 
the Georgia legislature for almost 
six months.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  Griffin Bell did some 
things worse than that.  Griffin Bell 
said to Andy Young, "Don't testify  
01:09:46 
against Bork [phonetic]."  Of course, 
as you know, Andy Young to his credit 
testified against Bork.

I want to make it clear that of the 
judges on the Fifth Circuit, Bell was  
01:09:57 
the least praiseworthy.  But the 
Fifth Circuit was of the highest 
caliber of productivity for 
empowerment and for the 
revitalization of the 15th amendment.  
It as amazing.  These people treated 
what we were doing as their work.   
 
The only reason the Fifth Circuit 
didn't send Theron Lynd to jail was 
because they were again concerned  
01:10:22 
about the political impact.  He was 
7'4" and he weighed 400 pounds.  They 
didn't want him to die in jail.  But 
they tried him for contempt and they 
got what they wanted out of him.   
 
Again, once it became clear that you 
were faced with Theron Lynd-type 
recalcitrance throughout the State of 
Mississippi, then you had to come up 
with a new mechanism.  Allah; comes  
01:10:50 
the Voting Rights Act, and it was 
written by the Department of Justice.

Fannie Lou Hamer calls and she says, 
"Mike, you know the man who's the 
postman?"  He said no.  She said, 
"Well, he brings me this big envelope 
from the White House."   
 
Then Mr. Turnbow calls.  He said, 
"Michael, I want to let you know I 
got an invitation to the White House 
and I want you to do something for 
me, Michael."  Michael said, "What do  
01:12:20

said, "I want you to find out what 
ball the Governor of Mississippi is 
going to because I want to dance with 
his wife."   
 
Hartman Turnbow, as you know, is a 
man who was accused of destroying his 
house, setting his house on fire.  
His wife and his daughter are in this 
house.  He comes out shooting, and he

Mississippi said we can't have a

is.  What they decided, Julian, was 
that this man died of a heart attack. 
 
I know that you may find this hard to 
believe.  John Doar and others asked 
me if I'd be willing to go to the 
sheriff or Leflore County, get him to 
sign arrested - - bond to take to the 
sheriff of Holmes County and have Mr. 
Turnbow released to me.   
 
In Holmes County, 80% of the black  
01:13:24 
people own their land.  What was so 
strange about this was the Department 
of Justice understood that the only 
way to handle this was to go along 
with the State of Mississippi in the 
position that there was no murder.  
It was a just a house burning.  Of 
course, because the Department of 
Justice rigorously defends Mr. 
Turnbow, all charges are dropped on  
01:13:49 
that.  I did this myself.

INTERVIEWER:  One final name you 
mentioned a couple of times.  Robert 
Moses.  
 
MR. GUYOT:  Robert Moses is a young 
man who came to Mississippi, a 
mathematician and a philosopher who 
was able to get the most out of 
people regardless of what they  
01:14:22 
thought of themselves.  Robert Moses 
was a person who was totally 
committed to social change, who was 
able to work with anyone.  He was 
able to be both an intellectual and a 
total humanist.  He was a man who 
believed that there was political 
potential in everyone and who behaved 
that way, and who got a lot of people 
associated with him to behave that  
01:15:03 
way.  He was a totally courageous 
person, totally committed, and a 
thinker that has few people on his

level.  He was able to take problems 
and turn them into solutions.  He was  
01:15:21 
able to meld the difference between 
the rigidity of some of the SNCC 
folks with the free expression of 
total liberty to others.  
 
He firmly believed that he was ahead 
of the game on one other tenant.  He 
firmly believed that those who do the 
work should make the decisions.  He 
firmly believed that whenever anyone 
was arrested in SNCC, you either go  
01:15:47 
to get them out of jail or you go to 
jail with them.   
 
He was a man who was beaten in 
McComb, and he files charges against 
the person who beat him.  The sheriff 
heard and he held a trial.  We know 
how the trial went Julian.  Then they 
guide him out of town.  It's just 
unheard of.  You mean expect to be 
treated legally by a legal system  
01:16:13 
that is designed not to treat people 
like you?  He goes before a judge in 
McComb and the judge brags about how

writes, "Racists are never more

exposed than when they brag." 
 
He was a man who was able to lay out 
the framework of what's was going to 
happen in Mississippi.  We couldn't 
do anything in Mississippi without 
the approval of the people of 
Mississippi, and we got it.  We got 
it because we made it clear to them 
that we were never going to say to 
them, "Look, you need to go register  
01:16:56 
to vote.  Here's where the courthouse 
is.  Go on down there."  We said to 
them, "We're going and want you to 
come with us."   
 
We never said to them, "We're going 
to protect you."  We never said, 
"Your name's going to be in the 
newspaper."  We never said to them, 
"You'll become an enemy of the state 
once you register to vote."  The  
01:17:18 
complexity and the beauty of how 
Mississippi was organized was we got 
thousands of people to make that

commitment.  
 
I think it pivoted on two things.   
01:17:30 
One, our style of operation.  Two, 
the church.  Three, the need for 
people to create a better way of life 
for their children.  We didn't have 
to tell people in Mississippi 
everything is political because they 
understood that the Board of 
Supervisors determined whether or not 
there was a hospital, whether or not 
there were jobs, who was going to get  
01:17:52 
paid.  You could look at who was 
registered to vote on the street by 
the houses that were paid.  You 
wanted tax exemptions. 
 
There was nothing that was 
nonpolitical in Mississippi, so we 
arrived at the early conclusion that 
the political avenue was a solution 
to a lot of our problems.  In the 
'60s, there was no Republican Party  
01:18:23 
in the South.  Nowhere to be found.  
It wasn't until 1964 that the 
Democratic Party in Mississippi

creates the unpledged electoral 
system, which allows us to become the  
01:18:38 
presidential electives for Lyndon 
Johnson.  But it also allows the 
infusion of the Republican Party.  
 
In 1964, the Republican Party in San 
Francisco kicks out black delegates.  
Kicks them out.  The Democratic Party 
is supporting the passage of the '64 
public accommodations act and of 
course later on the '65 voting rights 
act.  In 1960 you have the Democratic  
01:19:06 
Party being approached to intervene 
in Martin Luther King's arrest.  
Louis Martin and others get the 
president to call Dr. King's wife, 
Coretta Scott King.

recognize the value of reading and of 
books.  I want to be remembered as  
01:20:51 
someone who is committed to 
perpetuation of the mantra of the 
Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee.   
 
The only thing that the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee can 
be compared with is the Anti-Saloon 
League.  The Anti-Saloon League was 
very effective, though short lived.  
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating  
01:21:11 
Committee changed the very concept of 
democracy, changed the concept of 
citizenship, and opened to everyone 
the vehicle of empowerment.  
Empowerment is something that's 
contagious.  Once an individual makes 
something happen that they made 
happen, they're a different person.  
They don't wait for the next day.  
They say, "What do I need to do  
01:21:39 
today?"  Those are the kinds of 
people we need to have a good 
America.

anything, except that we have an 
obligation to transfer our skills and 
our knowledge to other people.  
You're doing that and I'm doing that.

MR. GUYOT:  No, but let us hope that 
we will understand the gravity of our

situation, and in the next two years 
we will spread by geometric 
progression those who are actively 
organizing.  We don’t need people to 
support us and agree with us and not 
register their families to vote, not 
register their churches to vote, not 
register their clubs to vote, and not 
really make organizing a social 
necessity.

They no longer function on our

behalf.  Isn't it amazing how we as a 
race have moved from the concept of 
"us" to "me"?  We're the last group
