WG: Alright. So, if we could just begin by you giving your full name, your date of birth 
and your place of birth. 
LB: Okay. I’m Louise Willingham Broadway. I was born in Baker County, Georgia, a 
little town known as Newton. I was born in 1930, 8/6, 8/6/1930. 
WG: Okay. Alright. And so, let’s talk about your childhood, growing up, your 
experiences, what you remember of your— 
LB: Okay, my childhood experience in growing up, I was reared—my parents was 
farmers, sharecroppers. They did not have a farm of their own. And we did not have school buses 
at the time that I was growing up. We had to walk to school, to church—we had schools in 
church. And we had to walk to school in the cold every morning. Some mornings, it was so very 
cold you couldn’t hardly feel your feelings in your—feel your hands when you’d get to school. 
But they had an old potbellied stove that they would fire up, and we would gather around it and 
soon get warm. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And that was my childhood experience of school. 
WG: Of schools? Did you just think that the schools, the conditions of your schools, 
those were normal? Did you notice the conditions of white schools? Did you know anything 
about the white schools in the area? 
LB: The white—well, the children would pass by us on the school bus. They would ride 
to school. They would ride to school, and we would have to walk to school, regardless of your 
distance. Some children walked as much as ten or fifteen miles to get to a church. And yet, the 
white children on the white buses would pass by them, living in the same neighborhood. 
WG: Okay. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013

LB: But we could not ride the bus in my childhood, growing up, at school. 
WG: Okay. So, what about your experiences in school, your teachers? Do you remember 
any of your favorite teachers? 
LB: Yeah. I remember my teachers. One of them was Miss Sallie Mae Terrance and one 
was Miss Mary Hawkins. We taught—in the church, and inside the church, you didn’t have any 
partitions between the classrooms, you know. They would take about three pews, you know, for 
first grade, and they taught from the first through the seventh, all one— 
WG: All in the same sanctuary? 
LB: In the same sanctuary. One teacher— 
WG: Wow. 
LB: Not one for each class. And they would have a session for first grade, second, third, 
fourth, fifth, up through seventh. 
WG: That’s amazing. 
LB: And you had to keep quiet, you know. You wouldn’t be disturbing the teacher while 
she was teaching from one class to another. She had a time for each one, you know, time for the 
class. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And that is the way—we really got a good education, though. Right now, I can 
appreciate those days. They were hard, not having heat, and, you know, having to try to be quiet 
and listen. But we made it! 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And I graduated from—left the seventh grade, then I went to high school. 
WG: Okay. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
4 
 
LB: High School was down in Newton. They had—it was two high schools. One was in 
the east, and one was in the west for the black people. 
WG: Okay. So, you had two Newton colored high schools? 
LB: That’s right. They had a—that’s right. 
WG: And which one did you attend? 
LB: Well, I went to Newton Colored High School. They did not—when I was in high 
school, they just added the West Baker High School after my graduating from Newton Colored 
High School. 
WG: Okay. And what was Newton Colored High School like? I mean, was it a—? 
[05:00] 
LB: We had— 
WG: Do you have fond memories? 
LB: They had barracks, Army barracks. Maybe, I guess, they were brought in by the 
state, you know. And they had barracks that we would go in from class to class. And they had 
one little building that they called our chapel in the Home Ec department. And that’s where we 
had chapel and Home Ec department in one building, and then, the other barracks we had 
different classes. The teachers had them at different times. 
WG: Okay. So, were you an only child? 
LB: No. I’m the youngest of four. 
WG: Of four? Okay. And so, what was your relationship like with your older brothers 
and sisters. Did they watch after you, since you were the baby? 
LB: [Laughs] Well, I think they spoiled me because I was the youngest. I only had one 
brother and two sisters. And growing up, the second child, which was my sister, she never did 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
5 
 
want me to do anything. Every time it was time for my chores for anything, she would always 
like to do them for me, because she loved me so. And I think it kind of spoiled me. When she left 
home, then I had chores to do that she used to do for me, and it was kind of hard. But we were a 
lovely family and we lived in a one-room country shack. 
WG: Wow. 
LB: We had a bed for Mother and Father, a bed for the girls, and one for the boys. And 
one kitchen, one kitchen, no dining area. 
WG: Right. 
LB: But, believe it or not, we made it. And had an open fireplace. You would burn up in 
front, [laughs] and freeze behind—but we made it through! We had a joyous childhood together 
under the circumstances. 
WG: Right. So, what do you remember about your parents the most, besides them being 
hard workers? What type of lessons did they seek to instill in you? 
LB: My parents instilled in me that we had to learn to endure with what we had. 
Regardless of what somebody else had, what they could afford to give us, they learned us to 
appreciate that. We had to go to Sunday School. We had to go to church every Sunday, and we 
had to put church first, regardless of school activities or whatnot. You had to go to church before 
you go to school activities. And they had us—you know, it might have been just meat and bread, 
but we never went hungry. We never went hungry. My father worked at a gristmill, you know, 
where they grind meal. 
WG: Gristmill? 
LB: Yeah, that’s where they would take corn and grind it up to make meal. 
WG: Okay. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
6 
 
LB: And that’s where my father worked. And my mother worked as a maid from house to 
house. 
WG: Okay. So, let’s go back to high school. You graduated from high school in what 
year? 
LB: 1948. 
WG: 1948? 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: And what were your plans? I mean, did you know? 
LB: Well, really and truly, my plans were to go to college. But at that time, my father, I 
told you, worked as a sharecropper, and my mother worked, and they was working for from fifty 
cents to a dollar a day. And at that time, no way in the world, you know, they could send me 
away, and away to school. So, they just—they were not able to send me away to school, so my 
first job was working as a maid in the kitchen, working for a dollar a day. 
WG: Okay. Who were you working for? Do you remember the family you worked for? 
LB: Ah? 
WG: Do you remember who—what was the name of the family that you worked for? 
LB: Oh, the name of the family was Mamie McCorral. 
WG: Mamie McConnell? 
LB: McCorral. M-C-let me see, M-C-C-O-R-R-A-L, I believe. 
WG: Okay. Okay, so— 
LB: Well, Mamie White! I’m sorry. No, it was. Her name was Mamie White. I’m sorry. 
WG: Mamie White? 
LB: Her name was Mamie White, not Mamie McCorral. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
7 
 
WG: Okay. 
LB: But she was named Mamie White. That’s who I worked for. 
WG: And how was her treatment—their treatment of you? 
LB: Yeah. 
WG They treated you well? 
LB: They were very nice. I had to walk. We lived about five miles from where they lived. 
And I would walk every morning [10:00] to clean house and fix dinner and, you know, do 
whatever house chores there were to do. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Um-hmm. But they were very nice people. 
WG: Um-hmm. And how long did you do this, I mean, for how long? 
LB: I worked as a maid for about a year after I finished high school. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And then, I got married. I finished high school in 1948. I got married in 1949. 
WG: Who was your husband? 
LB: My husband was Grady Broadway, Jr. 
WG: Okay. And how did you meet Grady? How did you meet Grady? 
LB: How did I meet him? 
WG: Um-hmm. 
LB: Well, now, [laughs] the way I met Grady, I had a cousin—I guess the name’s been 
called, Carl Broadway? 
WG: Um-hmm. 
LB: He married my cousin, one of my cousins. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
8 
 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And I would often go spend the weekend with this cousin. And Grady’s oldest 
brother was rearing him, because their parents passed away early. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And way back in the—and we were very young. We would see one another and 
smile about it and never thought one day we would get together to be husband and wife. 
WG: Right. 
LB: Now, that’s how we first started, you know, just being around one another. And his 
father would bring him to church, and my mother would bring me to church. We’d just smile at 
one another. So, in the late ’40s, he moved up in the community where I lived. And that’s how 
we got back together, just old friends got back together. And one day, he asked me to marry him, 
and I married him, [laughs] and we had five children together. 
WG: Five children? 
LB: Uh-huh. Our second children were twins. 
WG: Oh, wow! Okay. 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: So, you had a house full? 
LB: Yes, yes, but we maintained. 
WG: So, talk about the racial conditions in Baker County. When did you first start 
noticing or, you know, begin to—? 
LB: Well, really, as a child, I noticed race, so far as the whites being able to ride the 
school bus. 
WG: Okay, that was the first thing. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
9 
 
LB: And blacks walked in the cold. And they would, you know, pass you and throw out 
spitballs or whatever. We were walking from the school. Now, I noticed that, you know, as—in 
my childhood. 
WG: How did you feel about that? Did you think that that was just the way it was? Or did 
you feel it was unfair? 
LB: Oh, at the beginning, I knew it was unfair! You know, but it wasn’t anything I could 
do about it. 
WG: Right. 
LB: It wasn’t anything I could do about it, but I knew that was unfair. But, you know, 
that was the way it was then, and we had to accept it. And so, going to high school, well, they 
had the Newton High School, that was the white school, and Newton Colored High School. So, 
you know, we never crossed each other’s paths at that time. 
But then, later on down during the years, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, and time, 
you know, for children to desegregate the schools, I would say it like that—okay, then my 
family—I had married then and had children of my own when this got started. 
WG: Okay, 1954. 
LB: So, at the time, my husband was working for James Robert Rose as a sharecropper. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And we signed our first child, which was the eldest, Jesse Lee Broadway, to the all-
white school. So, when James Robert Rose heard about we had signed the child to go, then he 
told my husband that if he didn’t withdraw his name, then he was going to have to pay him 
everything he owed him before the end of the year. You see, you got your pay at the end of the 
year. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
10 
 
WG: Right. 
LB: So, we had to withdraw our eldest son from the white school, you know, register 
from the white school until the end of that year. 
WG: Right. 
LB: At the end of that year, my husband stopped working for this farmer. The next year 
we were able to send [15:00] three children to the integrated school. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: But it was not easy. 
WG: So, do you—yeah, do you think that was sort of a widespread intimidation tactic? 
LB: Yeah, it was. One of my sons was beaten so bad that he had to be hospitalized. 
WG: At school?! I mean, can you—? 
LB: At school! At school! They brought him home that evening. We had to bring him up 
to the doctor, and he had so many bruises that he had to be hospitalized. 
WG: So, what happened? Do you know? Did he ever talk about what exactly transpired? 
I mean, what happened? 
LB: Oh, they—just a gang of the white boys just jumped on him and just beat him up, 
stomping him and kicking him! And he had to be hospitalized for a few days. They would follow 
our children—at this time, you know, it was buses then, but they would follow our children 
home. A gang of whites would follow our children home when they’d get off the bus. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: They would attack them. One day—and I worked in Albany. One day, they attacked 
them at school, and I got a call at work. And I was driving an old Plymouth and I was driving so 
fast the speedometer chain broke, trying to get home to my children. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
11 
 
WG: Right. 
LB: You know, to protect them from the group that was attacking them. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And it was very hard for us, you know, to see your child—you didn’t know whether 
or not they was going to make it back home alive or not. 
WG: Right. 
LB: But we know somebody had to stand up! You know, if all of us had backed up, you 
know, we wouldn’t have had—we wouldn’t be as far as we are today. We’re not where we 
should be, but it’s better than it was, you know, at that time. 
WG: Sure, sure. So, did anything ever happen to the group of boys? 
LB: Nothing happened to the group of boys. But they did start patrolling the campus 
better around the school, you know, have someone outside to try and keep these kind of events 
from happening again. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: Alright. So, now, you said that you were working in Albany when this happened. 
LB: Yeah, I worked for a medical doctor. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: As a doctor’s assistant for thirty years. 
WG: Oh, okay! 
LB: And this same doctor—the Saturday during the marching and the demonstration 
down in Baker County, they had what you call this “Bloody Saturday.” 
WG: Bloody Saturday, um-hmm. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
12 
 
LB: And some of these civil rights workers and some of the citizens that was beaten up 
so bad, they brought some of them to Dr. J. L. Shirley, Jr.’s office, where I worked, to be treated. 
He treated several, just treated them for free, several of the Freedom Riders and the citizens who 
was beaten by the mob on that Bloody Saturday. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: They carried some to Camilla, and Camilla refused to take in all of them. So, they 
had to bring them to Albany or take them to Arlington or some other place other than Camilla. 
WG: Um-hmm. And so, you were there when they were bringing these people in? 
LB: Oh, yes! I was working for the doctor at that time. Sherrod was one of the persons 
that they brought in, you know, all banged and bruised up. 
WG: So, did you know Sherrod at that time? 
LB: Well, only by—yes, because I, you know, lived in Baker County, and the Movement 
was in progress at that time. 
WG: So, what did you—I mean, how did you respond? What did you think? I mean— 
LB: Oh, I just thought how cruel it was! You know, they said they had ax handles and 
knives— 
WG: [Sighs] 
LB: And baseball bats and guns. 
WG: Uh. 
LB: And St. Matthew’s Missionary Baptist Church, where I’m a member, this is where 
they had to regroup and go back to the church. And they had to lie down under the pews and 
things, because they was firing shots at them at the church on that Bloody Saturday. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
13 
 
WG: Right. So, and a lot of the churches around Baker County were attacked because 
they were holding meetings? 
LB: That’s right. That’s right, because that’s where we had our meetings. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: I was one of the secretaries of the Baker County Movement. 
WG: Okay. So, talk about that. I mean, in your position as secretary, beyond taking notes, 
what else did you do? What type of inside information do you have that could help us understand 
a little better? 
LB: Well, what I would try to understand—what each and every one of the citizens 
would get up and express themselves [20:00] about certain things that happened to them, you 
know, during the day or the night. I would have to take notes of the happenings. 
WG: Okay. And what did you do with these notes? What happened to them? 
LB: Believe it or not, I have some of them! 
WG: You do? 
LB: And I have some of them down in the library at East Baker Historical Society down 
in Newton right now. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: I was looking at some of the notes that I took where one parent was saying one of his 
children got hit, side of the head, with a stick or all this kind of stuff. And then, we would have, 
you know, the civil rights people, some of them, to come down—[Department of] Justice, I 
would say—and listen to some of the complaints and all of the citizens, how badly they were 
treated, in order to try to make things better. We just wanted equal opportunities. 
WG: Right. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
14 
 
LB: See, we had to use the books that the whites used one year. Then, the next year, 
maybe, or when the books were worn and all, torn, those are the books that we would get at our 
schools. And we just knew that wasn’t justice. And the only thing we wanted is equal 
opportunity. It wasn’t so much to integrate, [laughs] you know. 
WG: Right. 
LB: But if they just only had given us a chance to have materials to work with our 
children that they had, we figured we would have had better, you know, better opportunities to 
become better men and women and educated men and women in the society. 
WG: Okay. So, [whispers something off-camera]. Alright, so you talked about the 
Bloody Saturday and civil rights workers being brought into the doctor’s office. So, I take it the 
doctor wasn’t one who was against what was taking place. Do you think that he supported the 
Movement? You said his name was— 
LB: Dr. J. L. Shirley, Jr. 
WG: Shirley, Jr.? 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: And so, do you think he supported what was taking place? How do you feel about—
I mean—? 
LB: Oh, I think he really supported, you know, treating the ones that was injured on this 
Bloody Saturday. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: He was—did it with all—he wasn’t reluctant at all about treating them, like some of 
the doctors. Because, see, like I said, they took them to Camilla, but they would not treat them. 
WG: Okay. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
15 
 
LB: No, he was glad to be able to— 
WG: Help. And did he know that you were somewhat involved in the Movement? 
LB: Yes, he knew. And during my time working with Dr. Shirley, they offered a course 
down in Baker County, the commissioners offered a free course to take on emergency care, to 
ride on the ambulance, you know, to help to see about our people. And no blacks worked on the 
ambulance at that time. 
WG: Right. 
LB: And I would work at Dr. Shirley’s office, get off at five o’clock, and at night, I took 
this course in emergency medicine. And I was, you know, one of the first—I was the first black, 
really, to complete the course in the county, and would work at night. Sometimes I was called on 
duty, maybe at eleven o’clock and had to be at Dr. Shirley’s office around nine in the morning. 
WG: Wow. 
LB: But I just felt like we needed to try to help our people. And since the opportunity was 
offered to try and help—other than other people having to help your people all the time, whether 
or not—don’t know whether we was going to get justice, you know. I felt if we had someone of 
our color to help with our color and all other colors who had emergencies, it would be a whole 
lot better in the county. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: And I would— 
WG: And so, he was the one who recommended you for the course? 
LB: No, no, no. 
WG: Or you just took it? 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
16 
 
LB: No, he didn’t recommend me for the course. After I heard they were offering the 
course free, and this was an opportunity—now, we worked for free. We worked on the 
ambulance free. You took—they offered the course. They paid for the course, but you had to 
work free. 
WG: Oh! 
LB: And I worked on the ambulance, you know, [25:00] getting up all times [laughs] of 
night, day and night, but—until that free service went out. I worked until that free service went 
out on the ambulance in Baker County. 
WG: Okay. So, what year did you start working with it? Do you remember? Do you 
recall? 
LB: The course was offered in 1983, August of 1983, and it was a six-month course. 
WG: Okay. And what were some of the encounters—what were some of the more 
memorable encounters that you had working with EMS, being the first black? And how were you 
treated by the other—I imagine the other workers were white? Did you ever—? 
LB: Now, the workers, there were some—very nice, you know, didn’t discriminate and 
all. And there was others kind of stood their distance. But, in all, they were fairly nice about 
teaching me how to ride the ambulance and, you know, certain things about the ambulance and 
all of this. Some of them was very nice. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: Okay. I can’t really—is there any other thing about the Baker Movement, about 
your involvement in it, that you would like to share? 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
17 
 
LB: I really think I’ve about covered the most—the Bloody Saturday was one of those 
most—most [laughs, then sighs] horrible days you have ever heard of in your life or seen, you 
know, how they were just beating people down to the ground. And one of the ladies covered 
Sherrod’s body to keep them from killing him. They probably would have killed him. That was 
Josie Miller. I know you have heard that story over and over again. Now, that was mostly—one 
of the most unjust Saturdays that I could remember during the Movement time. 
Now, I can remember one time, though, we marched from First Pleasant Grove Baptist 
Church down to the courthouse to get some people registered to vote. 
WG: And this was in Newton? 
LB: And our sheriff—you’ve heard of “the Gator” [the county sheriff]? 
WG: Um-hmm. 
LB: Okay, and he was down there that day. And Sherrod was with us. And when we 
entered, he told Sherrod that, you know, he was not supposed to be there. He was not a citizen; 
he was an outsider. And, you know, he started telling him, “Well, we brought people here to get 
registered to vote.” And, in a split second, he hit him and knocked him over in a corner. 
WG: Wow. 
LB: And I was so afraid that, you know, he was going to kill him. But he got up, and he 
told him he had to leave. So, we all left. When he left, we all left and went back to the church. 
But don’t think that stopped us! We were right back down there that next morning! 
WG: Okay. [Laughs] 
LB: And we kept going until things got a little better about getting people registered, you 
know, to vote. 
WG: Um-hmm. When did you finally get registered? Do you remember? 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
18 
 
LB: When did I—? 
WG: Yeah, when did you finally get registered to vote? 
LB: Oh, I got registered during this time. During this time, I got registered to vote during 
this time. Because, I guess, let me see, I was in my—well, I was married at that time. But I guess 
I had not gotten registered to vote until they really started talking about it, because it was so 
complicated, we thought, you know, all the questions they asked and everything. But I got 
registered during this time. 
WG: Okay. So, you took one of the literacy tests to get registered? Did you have to take a 
literacy test, or did they just allow you to sign your name? 
LB: They allowed me, at that time, to sign. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Um-hmm. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Yeah. I didn’t have to take the literacy test. 
JB: [Clears throat] When I was here two years ago, I heard several really appalling stories 
of what Gator did to people, just incredible cruelty, like hitting a man in the face, a young man in 
the face with a nightstick. And the lawyer, whom I think was King, Mr. King—? 
WG: Yeah, King. C. B. King. 
JB: He had to go to make sure he was getting some care in jail. But I wonder what 
happened to all these people who got beaten up and injured. You know, you hear about the day it 
happened, but what happened to them afterwards? 
LB: What happened to the people? 
WG: Um-hmm. 
Louise Willingham Broadway, March 9, 2013 
 
19 
 
LB: Well, after their injuries, you know, they still—we still worked with the Movement 
and [30:00] worked in, you know, Baker County still until we got people registered to vote and 
things got a little calmer. He finally got a little bit calmer than he was at the beginning, in that 
there was—you know, people used to be afraid to even come through Baker County, because he 
was going to stop them, and you surely was going to get a ticket, you know. [Laughs] They 
would go around miles, like around Camilla if they wanted to go to Bainbridge, to keep from 
coming through Baker County. 
He was just—he was just a mean—he just was a mean man, all I can say. He had a 
service station and he put up signs saying, you know, during our demonstrations and everything, 
that he only wanted white business. He didn’t want black business. But he finally took ill, had—I 
don’t know, he had a stroke or something—and he stayed down for years before his death. 
WG: Oh, wow, so he suffered a long time. 
LB: And that’s how, you know, things kind of got a little better in Baker County. 
WG: Okay. 
JB: What about the people who were injured? Did the Movement help with medical care 
and stuff for people that got injured? 
LB: Say did the Movement help? 
JB: Did the Movement help with that? 
LB: Oh, yes! It really gave us the right to speak. You know, a lot of things we used—you 
used to couldn’t—if a white person said something to you, you weren’t allowed maybe to say 
what you thought. But now we speak freely, whether, you know, [laughs] we speak freely and 
say things that we want to say, you know, where we used to couldn’t respond to them. You just 
couldn’t say anything to the white man! Don’t, he would—you know, they’d knock you down or

hit you or kick you or do anything. But now, you have your freedom of speech. That’s one thing 
we have, our freedom of speech, and we really use it when it’s necessary, [laughs] when it’s 
necessary to speak our opinion. 
WG: Right. 
LB: And the Movement helped! It helped a lot. It did, because it helped to get people 
registered to vote, you know, and it helped in the desegregation of schools. It gave people more 
courage and more wisdom to stand up for what was right. It helped a lot. 
WG: Okay. So, I guess, one of the questions I guess we’re trying to get to is Dr. Shirley, 
and this Bloody Saturday again, and the students coming in and needing to be treated. How did 
they get their bills paid? Did he charge them? 
LB: He did not charge them. 
WG: He didn’t charge them? Okay. 
LB: He did not charge them. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: He didn’t worry about the charges for those that had gotten beaten up and bruised up. 
That was his gift. 
WG: His way of giving to the Movement. 
LB: That’s right. That was his contribution, um-hmm. 
WG: Okay. 
LB: Yeah. 
WG: Okay. Well, I thank you, Mrs. Louise Broadway, for sharing your story with us. We 
are very grateful that you have taken the time out, and we appreciate it. 
LB: You are welcome. [Laughs]

WG: Yeah, you’re free to go roam the hallways. [Laughs]

LB: Okay.
