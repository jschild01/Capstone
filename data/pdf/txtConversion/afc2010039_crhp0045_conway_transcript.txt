JM: We are not recording to –  
JB: XD. 
 
JM: XD and I think with, to the XD cards and I think with that we can began. Is that 
right?  Okay. 
JB: The room tone is the same as the previous one [that is, the interview completed a few 
minutes earlier in the same room with Ms. Hamilton and Ms. Ulmer]. 
JM: Okay, the same room tone, that’s what it was, yeah, okay.  Mr. Conway, let me invite 
you to, to share some, to, to, to start today to share some reflections on your family and the 
community, um, here in St. Augustine when you were coming up. 
PC: Yes.  First of all, I’d like to thank you for taking the time to document this. Uh. 
JM: Forgive me.  I did forget one thing on the tape and I need to say it.  I beg your 
pardon.  This is a Civil Rights History Project interview for, uh, joint sponsors, the Smithsonian 
National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress. 
Forgive me.  
PC: Okay. Well, I’ll start off by, uh, just, uh, my history of growing up in St. Augustine, 
particularly Lincolnville.  It’s a black, uh, self-sufficient community.  [Clears throat] I recall, uh, 
early on, uh, just the, the feel of Lincolnville.  It was a heavenly place to grow up.  All the adults 
knew you. I knew most of the kids in Lincolnville.  Uh, I was raised after the age of five by my 
great-great-grandmother, uh, Ms. Julia Robinson [note: he intended his great-grandmother].  She 
was, uh, Seminole Indian and Spanish mixed.  She raised me with the understanding that I would 
acknowledge adults, be respectful, don’t steal, don’t lie.  That’s how I was raised and, uh, my 
mother and father and my three brothers moved out to, uh, a brand new development, uh, in 
West Augustine and that’s where they resided on Scott Street.

Unidentified speaker: The Rollins subdivision.  
PC: The Rollins subdivision, newly developed.  Uh, I recall, uh, as a child, uh, getting up 
in the morning.  I could run from sun up to sun down throughout Lincolnville with no problems. 
There was no concern about, uh, the children because all of the adults in Lincolnville watched 
out for the children and I spent mo – most of my time particularly at the Little Links, which is 
also housing the Galimore Center today [named for St. Augustine native Willie Galimore, who 
played professional football with the Chicago Bears].  It was the only black park in St. 
Augustine.  It was the only place blacks could go to for recreation and there was a lot of 
recreation when I was growing up.  You had football teams organized throughout the city. You 
had, uh, softball games with the adults at night.  We had, uh, uh, an instructor there, a Mr. Eddie 
Lee Vickers, who ran the facility.  I was amazed that you’d go in.  You had ping-pong. You had 
pool tables. You had all sorts of activities, even a man was training some of the, uh, kids to, uh, 
play tennis, archery.  I was just amazed you could do all this for nothing.  So I would spend most 
of my time as a youth, uh, there at the Little Links. 
The biggest problem growing up as a child is, uh, money.  Money was very scarce.  Uh, 
uh, I re, recall often thinking, well, I gotta find a way to put a little change in my pockets for my 
candy and ice cream, uh, because my great-grandmother just didn’t have it all the time.  So I 
would, uh, I’ll never forget.  I was on Washington Street one day. I saw these white paper boys 
on their bicycles riding away from the, uh, St. Augustine Record.  I’m thinking wow. [5:00] Now 
that, I was not supposed to go in that part of town.  That was a white area and it was only a block 
across from Washington Street, but that was a white area.  The blacks, you didn’t go there unless 
you were accompanied by an adult.  But, uh, I would stand there daily and watch these white 
paper boys riding away from the St. Augustine Record.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11

So I worked up the courage one day and I was ten years old, that’s, to venture over there 
and ask for a job.  And I went in and I recall speaking to this white gentleman and I’d say, “Well, 
look, I’d like to be a paper boy. Can I be a paper boy?”  So he looked down at me and he said, 
“Well, how old are you?” I told him I was ten. He said, “Well, uh, okay.  I’ll give you a try. 
Come back tomorrow.”  I left there happy as a lark. I went in and I told my, uh, my great-
grandma, I said, “Mama, I got a job as a paper boy.”  And she was happy.  She said, “You did? 
But I told you not to go over there, but alright since you went there, okay.  You got a job, but I 
want you to sell.  You can not go out of Lincolnville to try to sell papers.”  I said, “Oh, oh, okay, 
Mama.”  So she ironed up my shirt.  I shined up my bicycle.  I went in the next day and, uh, uh, 
and they gave me a few papers and I went throughout Lincolnville trying to sell them.  But, uh, 
after a period of about two weeks, uh, it didn’t work out too well.  I’m out in the hot sun, uh, 
three, four, five hours a day to make ten cent wasn’t too, it wasn’t too good.  I started thinking, 
“Well, maybe I’m not too good at this. I, I can’t make any money.  It’s not worth standing 
around making ten cent pretty much most of the day.”  
Uh, and this one particular day, uh, I’m thinking, “Well, how can I make more money?” 
And I said, “Well, alright, wait a minute.  You’ve got that fort, that big fort there, uh, in the 
downtown area” [Castillo de San Marcos, now part of the National Park Service], the white area. 
So I said, “Alright, let me, I know I’m not supposed to go, but let me give it a shot.”  So I came 
over here one day at the fort.  I stood in front of the fort and within about an hour, I sold every 
paper I had.  So I had to go back to the St. Augustine Record and get more papers and I came 
back in an hour.  I sold all of those.  So I went back a third time and got papers and sold those. 
The people would come out of the fort, look at me, and take pictures: “Oh, what a cute kid.”  
You know, and oh, I was happy.  I know the, that first day of working at the fort, I had, I had 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 5 of 39 
 
never up to that point made a dollar bill.  I had about four of five in my pocket.  Uh, I couldn’t 
believe it.  So this went on for, uh, a few weeks.  I’d go in to pick up my papers and, uh, you’d 
have a line of white paper boys, but I would always be allowed to go right up to the front 
window and get my papers and, uh, I’d say, “Wow.  They, they, I guess that they treat me, the 
black, the only black kid here. So they’re putting me up at the front of the line. I get my papers.” 
Uh, I didn’t see the sign “colored” there [laughter] and there weren’t, I was the only paper boy at 
the time, uh, and not even aware of, you know, race or anything else.  
Uh, so I came in one day and, uh, one of the white men there said, “Well, you know 
something?  You sell more papers in three days than this whole group in a week.”  He said, 
“What are you doing?”  I said, “Well, I, I just go out and I ask the people to buy the papers.”  
And this one particular day, uh, before that, I used to see some of the white paper boys on their 
bikes trying to follow me, but I’d, you know, circle around, circle around, and lose them and, uh, 
but this one particular day, I said, “I don’t care if they do follow me.”  So I did.  I had two white 
paper boys to follow me up to the fort and, uh, they took positions to my left and right.  And now 
as the people came out of the fort, they would come out and look.  They’d look at me.  They 
would look at the two white kids and uh, they started buying papers from either one of the white 
guys.  Uh, being a ten year-old, I thought, “What is going on?”  I’m trying to figure, well, I’m 
looking at my shirt.  Is my shirt dirty?  I’m looking at my pants. Are, are my pants dirty? I, I 
couldn’t figure out what was going on, but they would come out of the fort, [snaps fingers], 
they’d take a look, and they’d buy from either one of the white kids.  And I’m saying, “Well, 
they’re not any handsomer than me.  You had one guy with blonde hair and blue eyes. So what?” 
I said, “Well, well, I was a pretty sharp-looking kid.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 6 of 39 
 
But I, I, uh, I’ll never forget.  I, I sat on the curb there across from the fort.  I’m trying to 
figure out what is, what is going on.  I can’t understand what was going on.  So it happened, uh, 
for a few days until the point I said, “Well, look, okay. I see that people are not going to buy 
papers from me.  I don’t know why.”  Uh, so I had to find another [10:00] location.  I did find 
other locations.  They weren’t as, uh, good as the fort, but, uh, uh, like I said, the life of a paper 
boy is only a year or two.  So I, uh, after, after twelve, I looked for other work.  Uh, I worked 
throughout St. Augustine, uh, in many locations, uh, and the only thing you’d get pretty much at 
that time was washing dishes, washing pots, or, oh, cleaning up floors.  But I managed to eke out 
a little, uh, living out of it.  I kept money in my pocket.  
Uh, I’m in high school now, uh, and I’m really disenchanted with the high school.  I 
would, uh, challenge my teachers about the books being four or five years old, written in. I 
would always be told, “Well, just, aw, just stop making a fuss.”  Uh, fortunately for me, uh, my 
uncle, Edward Norton, who moved to New York with his family, uh, left a small library of books 
and at that time, I loved to read.  I’ll never forget his medical books, uh, and I had a little more 
advanced education than most of the kids in my high school.  I would even challenge some of the 
teachers with some of the things they would say about history behind some of the books my 
uncle left.  Uh, so I was considered somewhat of a, a troublemaker or a rabble-rouser or a, I 
always felt I was a smart student, but, uh, there was no change.  
Then I started seeing, uh, the way my mother particularly would be treated when she’d 
come, like I said, uptown or downtown to buy clothes or to, uh, to buy goods.  It was always 
“Julia this, Julia that,” and she would respond, “Ms. so and so and Ms. that.”  It started annoying 
me.  I said, “Well, well, why isn’t she being called ‘Ms.?’ Why does she always have to call 
someone ‘Ms.’ or ‘Mr.’ and they call her by her first name?”  I started getting annoyed, uh, with 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 7 of 39 
 
that.  I, I didn’t say anything to her, but I was annoyed and they started a program in my high 
school called the DCT where you would get credits for, uh, working outside of school and I, I, I 
thought it was a joke.  I thought the program was a joke.  Are they going to give me credits for 
working?  That’s all I’ve been doing since I was ten.  So I said, “Well, let me join this program,” 
which I did and, uh, the teacher approaches me one day and says, “Well, um, well, uh, we have 
to find you a job.”  I said, “I have a job.” “Oh, alright. Well, get your employer to, to fill out this 
form so that you can get credit for it.”  
And I was working out at, uh, on Anastasia Island, Island with my father at a grocery 
store there and I took the form to the owner.  I said, “Would you mind filling this out so I could 
get credit in high school for working here?”  He said no, he don’t want to get involved. I said, 
“Well, why not? I’ve been working for you for the last couple of years.  What do you mean you 
don’t want?”  “Well, no, I’m not going to sign it.”  Now at the time, I’m in about the eighth or 
ninth grade and I was doing this guy’s accounting.  You know, he would, he showed me how to 
go into his, the back, and order whatever goods he needed and I was doing that, plus stocking 
groceries and he was only paying me, uh, I think forty dollars for working, uh, pretty much a 
fifty-day week, I mean a fifty-hour week.  And he refused to sign.  I said, “Well, I’ll tell you 
what. I quit and I’ll get another job.”  And he said, “Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute now.”  And 
I was a good worker.  That’s one thing.  Any job I worked, I did it well and I knew that and, uh, 
he said, “Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me think this over.”  I said, “Well, there is nothing to 
think over.  I’m just asking you to fill the form out.  It’s nothing out of your pocket.”  
So he caved in and filled the form out.  And I started getting credits upon credits upon 
credits because I always worked.  I had to work.  I was staying with my great-grandmother.  Uh, 
I didn’t know poverty, but I know we didn’t have much and, uh, I tried to help out as much as I 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 8 of 39 
 
could. But I was still upset about the treatment, uh, not only of myself, my parents.  Uh, my 
father also was working at the same grocery.  He wasn’t making that much. Uh, my mother, uh, 
the most she could find was tourist work or some menial job.  So I always growing up wanted to 
do something about that. I didn’t know what to do or how to do it.  
Uh, [15:00] so I would go to, I started going to Florida Memorial College.  Like I said, it 
was the only pool, uh, in town for blacks.  A couple of my fen – friends at high school drowned 
in a sinkhole behind Murray High School.  I used to jump off the pier with the little bridge 
coming, uh, from West Augustine, uh, into, uh, uh, Lincolnville, just a little crossover. I recall 
jumping off that pier with four or five of my friends.  One did drown in there, but there was no 
place for kids to swim, black kids in particular.  So, uh, at least the college, Florida Memorial, 
opened up their pool in the summer to a lot of the black kids.  Now that’s when I got involved 
with, uh, listening to some of the, uh, the young, uh, male college students talking about 
demonstrating, talking about civil rights and talking about doing something about it. It intrigued 
me, alright. 
JM: What year were you born? 
PC: I was born in 1948. 
JM: Okay, just, alright. 
PC: Now. 
JM: So you were twelve in 1960 and –  
PC: Yeah, well, in ’60, actually I really started getting involved when I was about 
fourteen, fifteen. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. So ’62, ’63. 
PC: Mmm hmm.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 9 of 39 
 
JM: Yeah. 
PC: And like I said, it intrigued me.  I said okay and what I do recall is the training that it 
gave some of the kids that came there and one was, yes, you know, uh, uh, they embraced non-
violence as a tactic.  Uh, so did I, but I think the ear at the time and my ear at the time was 
leaning more toward the, some of the more, uh, I wouldn’t say radical, but the more direct 
speakers like, uh, Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X.  Alright, I’d hear of this Dr. King.  Uh, I, 
uh, found him to be, uh, very informed and passionate, but the, the understanding derived from 
the college kids, non-violent, non-violent demonstration is the way to go.  So that’s what we 
decided and I decided with them to embrace.  Now when the demonstrations started here, yes, I 
remember the kids going up to sit at the counters and, and what have you.  So I told my mother, 
“I’m going to start demonstrating.”  She said, “Well, I don’t think it’s a good thing.”  I said, 
“Well, Mom, we’ve got to do something.”  Uh, I recall at the time, uh, that it was a little hard, a 
little struggle to get the adults more involved in the demonstrations.  Uh, I felt that they were like 
in a trance.  I, I, I, I, it was just hard for me to go into the white neighborhood and see the way a 
lot of the blacks were being treated.  I said, “Well, why doesn’t somebody do something or say 
something?”  So I just said to myself, “Maybe they’re in a trance of something.  Maybe they’re 
so used to, uh, this particular way of being treated, uh, it’s, it’s at the point it doesn’t bother 
them.”  Uh, and I used to try to talk to my mother about it, but again, she just, “Aw, just let it go, 
just let it go.”  
JM: Of course, she had so much more to lose.  
PC: I don’t think there was much to lose.  I mean, there wasn’t, there wasn’t, uh, anything 
here. I mean, the way blacks survived in Lincolnville at the time, if it wasn’t for the black 
businesses along Washington Street, most of the blacks had menial jobs that weren’t paying 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 10 of 39 
 
anything. It was more slave labor than labor.  I mean, just to think about how my family eked a 
living amazes me to this day.  And like I said, the only thing that was then available was tourist, 
court work, or taking care of some white family’s kid.  You know, that, that was pretty much 
most of what blacks, uh, particularly non-professionals had to, uh, to deal with.  Now my mother 
was working for, uh, uh, this white lady out on Anastasia Island.  
And I’m still trying to eke a living myself and, uh, doing little things.  Uh, I, uh, was also 
cutting grass.  My, uh, great-grandmother, uh, helped to get a lawnmower and I cut grass on the 
side.  So this, my mother asked me, “Son, uh, my white friend,” I think she was clean, cleaning 
her house and keeping her kids at the time, “Uh, needs her grass cut. If I drop you off at her, cut, 
cut her grass, uh, uh, you think you can do it?”  I said, “Well, yeah, alright.”  It was a hot day, 
extremely hot day.  I said, “Okay, Mom, that’s your friend.”  I said, “I normally charge fifteen 
dollars to cut an average yard, but since it’s your friend, I’ll, I’ll charge her ten.”  So my mother 
drove me out with my lawnmower, dropped me at this lady’s house, introduced me, and I 
commenced to cutting her yard.  It’s very hot.  So the lady comes to her driveway and she calls 
me, “Purcell, would you like a cool drink and a sandwich?”  And I said, “Yes, thank you, 
ma’am.” 
I thought it was polite of her and, uh, when it was prepared, she came to her garage 
entrance again and said, “Alright, Purcell, you can come in. Everything’s made.”  So I came to 
the entrance of the garage and, uh, I’m looking and I said, “Well, where, where, where is the 
sandwich and the, and the drink?” And she said, “Over there.”  So when I walked up, she had set 
it down next to her dog, dog’s tray, dog food on this side, my sandwich and water on the other 
side.  So I looked at this woman and I said, “Mmm, boy, okay.  What is this mentality? What is 
with these folk?”  So I said, “Look, Miss, can I use your phone?”  And she said, “Well, oh, 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 11 of 39 
 
what’s the matter?”  I said, “Look, please, may I use your phone?”  She said, “Okay.”  So she 
allowed me to come in her house and, uh, I called my mother and I explained to my mother what 
had just happened and I could hear the frustration in her voice.  
She said, “Could you please put her on the line?”  So I did. I said, “My mother wants to 
talk to you.”  She said, “You know something, Ms. so and so and so?  I thought you was my 
friend.  I cannot believe that you would treat my child this way.  Let, let alone, I can’t believe 
you would treat, treat any child this way.”  She said, “Look, I tell you what.  I’ll, uh, be over 
there to pick him up immediately.” She said, “I am very sad at what you just did.”  And the wom 
– she, so the woman tried to apologize.  She said, “Naw, naw, naw, don’t worry.”  So she did.   
She came and she picked me up and we got back to our home and she sat and she said, “Well, 
now I can see what you’ve been trying to explain to me, just the way people treat you. I can see 
now.”  And Doc, that’s when she started getting involved. 
JB: Um, we have to pause for a second. 
JM: Okay. Excuse me one second. 
[Recording resumes after pause] 
JB: Okay. We’re back. 
JM: We’re back on after a short break and let me just interject quickly.  Dr. [Robert] 
Hayling is with us for the interview as well and we may be rejoined by Mr. Conway’s wife, June 
[Conway, his spouse, who attended the interview], as well as the afternoon progresses.  Please. 
PC: Okay. So I, uh, I participated in a number of the marches, but my mother insisted, uh, 
that I promise not to get arrested because there was, there would be no one to, I was living still 
with my great-great-grandmother and I tried to tend to her needs as best I could.  So she wanted 
to make sure that there was always somewhere, someone there with her and she asked me, 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 12 of 39 
 
“Please, just don’t get arrested. I don’t mind you demonstrating.”  I said, “Okay, Mom. I won’t 
get arrested.”  So I made sure on all the marches that I stayed, uh, near the rear and sometimes 
that didn’t work because too often, I was chased by the police.  They could never catch me, but, 
uh, no, I, I, I never got arrested and good thing because one particular night, my mother, my 
father, and my three brothers were all arrested.   So I was the only one out of jail. [laughs] It’s a 
good thing.  Like I said, I was there with my great-great-grandmother. 
JM: Wow.  
PC: But my parents were very active.  Uh, my mother was very passionate and my father 
was very supportive and my brothers too; they were out there.  I think at, uh, one point in St. 
Augustine amongst black households, it was a badge of honor to be arrested for the Movement 
and that was that passion and I think when the adults saw what was happening with the young, 
with their children and the teens out there, they got motivated and totally committed.  
JM: Yeah. You knew, you were a classmate of Samuel White? 
PC: He was one year, uh, below me, yes.  
JM: Okay. 
PC: I was, his brother, James White was, uh, he and I were in the same homeroom class. 
JM: Yeah. How did, um, how did young people your age kind of move through that 
period of time when peers were incarcerated as they were? 
PC: Oh everybody, well, you know, I, I, my own personal feeling is that, you know, we 
as young adults saw what the system of segregation was.  Our parents had lived under it.  We 
were growing up in it.  We decided, uh, to the death.  We’re not going to live this way.  Sorry. I 
mean, we’re going to push it.  As far as fear, I think fear had nothing to do with it.  I think when 
you live under oppression for so long, particularly seeing your parents, uh, live through it and 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 13 of 39 
 
now you’re coming up through it, my thing was, I, at fifteen, I’m going to do this for my future 
and my children’s future.  Now if, if it means getting out there to the death, I’m committed and I 
think that was the attitude of a lot of the young, uh, folk in high school with me. 
JM: Yeah. 
PC: And people talk about fear.  You know, like I said, when you get fed up to the point 
of being mistreated that fear no longer exists for you, it’s just doing something.  The anger is just 
doing something to break free of this, these chains and this oppression, and that’s what it was, 
segregation. 
JM: Yeah, yeah.  What, what, um, what memories come sharpest to your mind when you 
think about that long period of, of extended demonstration and protest? 
PC: Oh I was jubilant, I was glad.  I, I’ll show you how naïve I was.  I said, “Finally, I’ve 
got all these people helping me out.” I’m thinking I’m being helped, not realizing [laughs] that a 
movement has started, uh, uh, out there.  Uh, I wasn’t too much into the nat – national forefront 
of the po – political lens of this, but, uh, yeah, I was just, uh, amazed, uh, with Dr.  Hayling when 
I, uh, finally, uh got to know who he was and, uh, Dr.  King, Abernathy, Hosea Williams, and all 
these people started coming around or coming down.  I was, uh, I was like a fly on the wall.  I 
mean, uh, they probably never noticed me because I tried to stay in, in the background, but yes, I 
was, I would sit around and listen, uh, as best I could to what they had to say and what they were 
talking about.  I was just elated just to be out there to help and, uh, yes, I, uh, particularly.   
Now, uh, I recall after the Civil Rights Act was passed, we were, we were, we were kind 
of pressed to get people to go out to, uh, test, uh, the newly enacted law and we did have people 
coming in, uh, from out of town, uh, a lot.  Uh, I, uh, went out myself on, uh, one demonstration, 
uh, to St. Augustine Beach, uh, and with a group of, uh, uh, four other teens and this white man.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 14 of 39 
 
He drove us out, a tall white man, I think his name was Al Lingo, drove us out to the beach, and 
we were in the surf maybe about, uh, ten, fifteen minutes when you could see this, uh, large 
crowd of whites coming from, uh, North and South.  They were converging on our location and, 
uh, we weren’t too alarmed because they were at a distance, but they kept getting closer and 
closer.  So, uh, Mr. Lingo said, “Well, I, I guess we’d better get back in the car and leave.” Uh, 
there was a young, young, young teenage girl with us, a black girl, and she was running back to 
the car as fast as she could.  Now we were just casually running back.  Uh, she got back to the 
car before us and she locked all the doors and we could not get her to open them.  You know, we 
had enough time to get in the car and drive off.  We kept pleading, “Open the door.  Open the 
door.” And she was just hysterical, crying.  Uh, she was just frightened, just crying, boo, and we 
kept pleading, “Open the door.  Open.” She wouldn’t open the doors.   
So anyhow, the crowd finally converged around the car.  They, we were outside.  So Al 
told us to all get on one side of the car.  And, uh, they were taunting.  They were threatening.  
Uh, uh, they went to, uh, one truck and they put out angular weights.  Their intent was to bound 
our hands and feet and take us as far out into the surf as they could and, uh, drop us.  And I recall 
standing there thinking, “Well, Lord, I didn’t think I’d go out this way.” Now like I said, non-
violence was a tactic.  My life on the line, you’re coming after me.  I’m going to make sure that I 
leave a mark and that was, that was my thing.  I was pretty much self-trained in what I thought 
was a little karate at the time.  Uh, so I said, “Alright, well, first guy that comes out me, I got to 
do what I got to do.” But I, uh, I thought about it.  I said at one time, well, maybe, uh, uh, uh a 
run here or there might help us.  I said, well, look, I’m in the white neighborhood.  I wouldn’t 
know where to run.  There’s no place to run.  I mean, it’s all white folk.  And at that time, uh, my 
mindset was that, uh, most of the whites just hate black people.  I don’t know why, but they just

Page 15 of 39 
 
hate us.  So I, I just, I had very little trust [30:00] for, uh, uh, pretty much whites, uh, at that time, 
short of this man that we were with, and I’m, just well, maybe this is God’s will.  I said, well, if 
this is God’s will, uh, I have to accept it.   
But, uh, uh, one white, uh, kid walked past me and he punched me in the face and cut my 
lip open.  I started to jump back at him.  I mean, you’ve got a large mob there with bats and 
chains and, uh, the white gentleman, Al Lingo, put his hand across my chest and told me to stand 
my ground.  “Don’t fight back.  Stand your ground.” So as, as hard as that was, I did and then he 
was hit, I recall, over the head with a pipe.  The blood hit me in the face and he collapsed pretty 
much unconscious next to me and at that time now, you could hear at a distance a police car siren 
faintly.  You could hear it and seconds passed.  The, uh, the sound grew loud, louder and louder 
until at a distance, I could see, uh, coming from the South headed north, this police car, this one 
lone police car.  And as they got closer, the mob dispersed because I think they felt they had 
killed, uh, this white guy, Al, that they hit.  I think they, I, I thought the guy, I felt I thought his 
head crack open, but, uh, they, they dispersed.  Uh, uh, help was called.  Uh, he was taken to the 
hospital and we were taken back to Washington Street.   
And, uh, I’ll never forget.  Hosea Williams was so angered, he said, “Alright.  They think 
they’re going scare us away from the beach.  We’re going to come back stronger.” So with that, 
the, uh, a second demonstration was organized and a large group—uh, this occurred about two 
weeks later, uh—went back to St. Augustine Beach and I recalled, uh, getting off the bus, a 
quarter of, uh, helmeted police that we walked down between to the water and I think, I forgot 
the uh, the pastor’s name, uh, uh, that was leading the front of the march.  But, uh, whoever was 
in charge of the troopers at that time, uh, uh, came over to the group.  This time I made sure I 
was going to be in the front.  I said, “Well, if I’ve got to go today, I’m going to jail.  I’m, I’m 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 16 of 39 
 
going to be in the front of this march.” Because I was still upset.  I was hit in the face and, uh, 
and what have you, but, uh, this policeman, state trooper approached, uh, the front of the group 
and he told us, “Well, uh, a little problem.  Uh, before you can get in the water, we have to, uh, 
clear it of all these hostile whites in the water.  So give us a few minutes to clear it, but I assure 
you, you will go into the ocean today.”  
JM: This is a state trooper. 
PC: A state trooper.  So we stood there on the, the edge of the surf.  Alright, uh, they 
went in just about waist deep, the troopers, to force this angry mob out of the water.  I have never 
to this day seen a melee like it occurred that day.  Uh, the whites in the water had two-by-fours, 
chains, bats, and the fight was on.  I mean, it lasted, to, to me about fifteen, twenty minutes, but 
the Klan and their sympathizers were beaten into submission. 
JM: By white troopers? 
PC: By white troopers.  I could not believe it.  Now I’m really confused now. 
JM: Yeah, yeah.   
PC: Because I’m saying, “Wow, I can’t understand these white men beating up the other 
white men.  That’s, that’s a new one for me.” I, you know, I, I was really shocked, but it was, a, a 
melee.  They were knocking, uh, some of the Klansmen and their sympathizers out and then 
dragging them up to the, the shoreline and dropping them and going back in for more.  When I 
say they were beaten into submission, believe me.  I stood there and watched it.  I could not 
believe it and when it was over, this man in charge of these state troopers came back up to our 
group and he said, “Well, look, okay.  I think it’s safe for you to go in now.  I, I can’t guarantee 
the quality of the water, but it is safe for you to go in now.” 
JM: He actually made that joke? 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 17 of 39 
 
PC: He did.  He said it.   
JM: [Laughs] 
PC: I can’t get it.  And rightfully so.  Now when I went to the edge, I looked at the water.  
I mean, it was bloody.  I mean, the blood was that thick in the water.  Now a few of the 
demonstrators did go around and go into the surf for a few minutes, but it was so bloody, I 
refused to go into it.  I said, “No, this water’s too bloody.” And I mean bloody.  And, uh, I stood 
there thinking and I said, “Well, wow, I’m, I’m still kind of confused now.  I mean, these white 
men fighting other white men for, uh, my, uh, civil rights.” I’m, I’m trying to figure out, well, 
I’m, the first time I’ve seen this.  I’m, I’m confused as a fifteen-year-old.  I, I couldn’t, I couldn’t 
put that together, and it took awhile.  But I do recall going on demonstrations, uh, marches or sit-
ins or now to test the law after that.  When these state troopers told the Klansmen or their 
sympathizers to move, believe me, after that beating on the beach that day, they moved.  That’s 
one thing I do recall. 
JM: How, how did you ultimately explain it? Why did that happen? 
RH: Orders from the governor. 
PC: Oh, you know, the troopers coming down?  
JM: Yeah. 
PC: Yeah. 
JM: And taking that action. 
PC: Uh, I, I, I guess it was.  I think they were ordered down here from the, uh, the 
governor.   
JM: Yeah.  The governor just decided we’re just going to not keep having this happen.   
PC: Right. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 18 of 39 
 
JM: Yeah, finally. 
RH: The Justice Department was on, on the governor.   
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
PC: Mmm. 
JM: Dr. Hayling is, is mentioning also the Justice Department.  I mean, there were these 
wider forces coming down to stop the earlier pattern of violence. 
PC: Mmm hmm. 
JM: That was always visited on black people. 
PC: Mmm hmm.  
JM: Yeah. 
RH: [uncertain brief comment from Dr. Hayling] 
[Recording resumes after pause] 
JM: Okay.  Mr. Conway, I think, I don’t mean to cut you off.  There may be more to say 
on that, but I also, I would, I would be very appreciative if, if, if you could sort of double back 
and contextualize that moment by talking for a minute or two about the previous pattern of local 
law enforcement engagement, uh, with the Klan and in, in the context of these demonstrations. 
PC: Well, it, it, my vantage point, I, I, all I could, all, what I realized was that the police 
were not sympathetic to the demonstrators, just the opposite.  And again, uh, uh, having been 
involved with a couple of, uh, situations involving the police, no, I, I, I, my biggest fear was if I 
was ever arrested, I’d probably be beaten by the local police, but fortunately, I, I was never 
arrested.   
Uh, I had a situation wherein again, uh, being involved at tutorial school on Washington 
Street, uh, the young lady, uh, had a class of, uh, youth, I think the oldest probably being, uh, six

Page 19 of 39 
 
or seven.  She decided to take a small group, uh, to the movie theater here downtown.  Uh, I 
didn’t think it was wise.  It’s like I said, this was after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and I 
cautioned her.  I said, “Well, look, I don’t think it’s a good idea.” “Oh we’ll be okay.” She was 
by herself with the kids.  I said, “Well…”  But anyhow, I decided to hang around in front of, uh, 
the church at the edge of Washington Street there, uh, for a couple hours until they safely  
returned from the movie.  Uh, within twenty minutes, uh, I could hear kids screaming.  So I 
walked again over to the, uh, one block over where the St. Augustine Record is located, uh, uh, 
considered to be the white area at the time.  If you made it back to Washington Street, you were 
safe.  That was a black area.  And I could see the kids running towards me screaming hysterically 
and, uh, this young, uh, white female who was, uh, uh, who had taken them to the movies, she’s 
got one kid in her hand and she’s trying to run.  And I see this, uh, white male, uh, on a bicycle 
with a knife chasing them.  Now I intervened and stopped him.   
Uh, unfortunately, I was surrounded by two, uh, hulking, uh, policemen, uh, and I felt, 
well, they’re probably going to beat me up.  So, um, but I, I, then they had a police dog.  I said, 
“Alright.  I guess they got me.” I, but I could see a crowd on Washington Street gathered, 
looking over, and a couple of friends of mine came up to the policemen and said, “Well, what are 
you doing? What are you doing?” And they told them, “You little niggers get away from here.” 
“No, that’s our friend.  What are you doing?” They didn’t understand.  They’re like, “Didn’t we 
tell you to get away from here?” So one of the young men pushed the policeman and took off 
running.  So the policeman was so upset at that, they started chasing my two friends and left me 
there.   
But before one the cops left, he told his dog, “If he moves, [40:00] kill him.” So the dog 
sat and started growling.  I said, “Oh wow.” You know, a German Shepherd.  And the policeman 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 20 of 39 
 
could not catch my two friends.  So I could see them headed back toward me and I’m looking at 
the dog.  He’s growling.  I’m looking at the policeman approaching me.  The dog’s growling.  I 
said, “Well, look.  I have to make a decision.” So I said, “Well, what I’m going to do because 
I’m facing the dog and Washington Street is at my back,” I said, “I’m going to sl, turn slowly 
and run as hard as I can back to Washington Street,” which is only a good block to run before the 
policeman got at me.  And, uh, so I slowly turned.  The dog is growling the whole time.  And I 
took off as fast as I could, as hard as I could run, back to Washington Street.  When I got there, 
the people, uh, they, they were waiting.  They were clapping.  So I turned around and looked.  
The dog didn’t even move.  [laughs] He was still sitting.  [laughs] So now I’m taunting the 
police: “Yeah.  Come over here now.  Come get me.  Come get me.”  
So, uh, anyhow, some of the folks said, “Well, look, you’d better go ahead and go home,” 
which I did.  Now I, uh, I, I, I hid out for awhile, two days actually in one of the, uh, uh, church 
yards and people from the community would come by and give me water and sandwiches. 
JM: You hit out in the churchyard because you thought the police were going to find 
you? 
PC: Yes. 
JM: Yeah, and take you in. 
PC: Yeah. 
JM: Yeah.  You hid out in a churchyard? 
PC: Yeah, two days.   
JM: And people –  
PC: Two days, two nights. 
JM: Slipped you food and water. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 21 of 39 
 
PC: They would bring me water and, and sandwiches. 
JM: Yeah. 
PC: They said, “Don’t worry about anything.  Your parents, we told your parents.  
Everything is safe.  We’ll take care of you.”  
JM: What had happened inside the movie theater to drive the, the –  
PC: I never found out –  
JM: Yeah. 
PC: Uh, what, but I, I,  like I said, I, uh, we’re only talking months after the, uh, passage.  
So a lot of people were, uh, felt everything was okay and no need now to continue to, uh, uh, 
demonstrate or, uh, or to test the law. 
JM: Yeah.  You, you mentioned that it was a white student, young adult, I guess. 
PC: Yeah. 
JM: Doing this tutoring of young black children. 
PC: Mmm. 
JM: And she had taken them into this movie theater. 
PC: Yes.   
JM: Obviously there were some whites in different, from northern colleges, other 
contexts, came down and had different roles in some limited way.  Um, did you, did, did that 
involvement of whites, you mentioned, you mentioned Mr. Lingo earlier in the beach incident, 
how’d you, how’d you take the measure of these white folks who would get involved? 
PC: Well, believe it or not, those college kids, white, and it was, uh, uh, a pretty good 
group, those white college kids changed my perspective of whites.  I thought all whites hated me 
and other blacks just because we were black, but they changed my perspective.  You had one, uh,  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 22 of 39 
 
particular, uh, college, uh, uh, student, Gail Blattenberger, and I recently contacted her, uh, about 
two months ago, uh, and through emails, but she was like a mother hen to me.  She was only a 
few years older, but, uh, surprisingly, uh, is a story.  They, you had a group of kids from certain 
states in the North.  I know she was from Princeton, New Jersey, at the time.   
You had some other kids from, uh, Massachusetts, all over.  So what they did when their, 
uh, tutorial session was over here in St. Augustine, they invited a group of, uh, uh, black kids 
who participated in the program back to their homes and, uh, my mother didn’t want me to go.  
She said, “Well, look, no.  He’s too young.  I’m sorry.  I, I, I can’t let him go.” But I, I pleaded 
with my mother: “Mom, please.  I’d like to go.” It, it was a two-week trip.  She wouldn’t.  She 
said, “Well, no.  I’m, I’m, I’m worried about you.  I, I, uh, uh, I, I, I, I don’t know too much 
about the North and I don’t want you to go up there by yourself with the, these kids.”  
And they were young students themselves.  But anyhow, surprisingly, uh, they made up 
picket signs and picketed in front of my house to try to get my mother to relent and let me go for 
that two-week trick, trip with them.  And everybody was laughing.  They said, “What are these 
kids out there picketing the Conways?” [laughs] But, uh, my mother would come home every 
day and she would laugh.  She thought it was very funny.  So finally she, she relented and 
allowed me to, to go on that two-week trip, but I stayed with, uh, Gail Blattenberger and her 
parents and what a trip it was.  It was a very good trip and, uh, that, that just changed my, my 
whole perspective on white folk because [45:00] I, I, the only white folk I knew was the ones 
here in St.  Augustine pretty much.  And again, like I said, the, uh, not that they were nasty.  It’s 
just the way the treatment, like you were subhuman or something, I mean, uh, no respect.  You 
know, uh, and that’s, that’s what I had, but I with, uh, those college kids coming down, you had 
an entirely different perspective.   
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 23 of 39 
 
JM: Take, take me through sixty, late ’64 or ’65, ’66, and how you found your way 
through that period, your perspective on St.  Augustine as it’s reacting to the Civil Right Act’s 
passage, to the Voting Rights Act the next year, to –  
PC: After some, it took awhile for, uh, I mean, we may be talking a year or two to kind 
of, uh, uh, get into the, uh, the mindset of the business community here, the white business 
community, that yes, alright.  This is the law and you have to adhere to it.  Now I never had a 
problem.  Now I came to the same movie theater myself, uh, uh, I’ll never forget, to watch, uh, 
one of the James Bond movies with no problem.  Uh, restaurants, no, I, my, my money, my 
pocket wasn’t that tight to start hitting the restaurants, but, uh, you know, I didn’t have a 
problem.  I felt, uh, uh, more at ease now coming to the downtown white area than I had in years 
prior.   
JM: Yeah, yeah.  Um, as you move through that early, those, those close months, the 
close year or two after the heaviest of the, the, the, all these moments charged with so much 
potential violence, actual violence, did you, how’d you deal with all that in, in it’s, sort of, the 
way it carried forward with you? Was that something that you were able to step forward and 
away from without too much difficulty? Did you feel it in you? Did you –  
PC: Uh, uh, not much.  See I, I was, I didn’t think what I, I, or most of my friends or 
fellow demonstrators were doing was of any significance.  I just felt like hey, this is something 
that had to be done.  So I didn’t place that much importance on it, but I knew, I was just happy 
that we accomplished, uh, some things.  I wasn’t even aware when I was demonstrating, uh, uh, 
too much about a Civil Rights Act or a Voting Rights Act, but, uh, I was, I was just happy that 
these things had occurred.  Uh, now what helped me, now I wound up going to, uh, uh, a junior 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 24 of 39 
 
college in Daytona Beach where I met my wife, who was going to Bethune-Cookman [College].  
It was a trade school.   
Uh, now I took up, uh, brick masonry.  Alright.  We had a black instructor.  The class 
pretty much was predominately black.  It was for the first, uh, it was a two-year course, for the 
first year and a half.  Uh, we were scheduled to go in and take our final exam with the, I think, I 
guess some city agency in Daytona Beach.  Now in the, the year and a half we were there, the 
black students, uh, the last six months you had these two white students to come into the course 
and within a few months, they were allowed to go take the test to become a mason, a mason.  
And my teacher was outraged.  He said, “Wait a minute.  What do you, what do you – ?” He’s 
telling the school administration, “What do you mean that the only people, these guys are not 
even trained? They’ve only been there a few months.  I’ve got these young black men I’ve 
trained for the last year and a half and you mean to tell me you’re not going to allow them to go 
and take the test, their finals, so they can get their permits and what have you?”  
The school administrator refused.  My instructor, through protesting, was fired.  We were 
called to the, uh, administrator’s office and offered a settlement because we had a year and a half 
under this course that if we wanted our, uh, certificates, two-year certificate, that we’d have to 
spend the last six months in a carpentry class.  And, uh, believe it or not, the two white guys, 
even though they only had three months of training, they, they were given their, uh, certificates 
to work, uh, in construction.  Uh, we all refused.  So I never received, though I did a year and a 
half at Daytona Beach Community College, uh, in their [50:00], uh, uh, program, uh, I never 
received anything for it.  We weren’t even reimbursed.   
So that was the end of that, but fortunately, uh, uh, uh, I married and my wife is from 
New York.  We moved back with her parents in New York and, uh, uh, I got employment there.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 25 of 39 
 
But racism, uh, uh, I found was not just a southern issue.  It was worse in the North.  At least in 
the South, it was overt.  In the North, it’s a pat on the back and a smile on the face, and they’ll 
stab you as often as they can.  I worked the post, I worked in the post office my first five years.  
Uh, again here I am doing accounting for a supervisor who couldn’t even do it, but he’s being 
paid, uh, more money just to be over the blacks.  [coughs] Excuse me.  
Fortunately, uh, the Civil Rights Act was, uh, important in its passage because it did open 
the, the flood gates, I would put it that way, for black opportunities, particularly in the North 
because most of the people I went in with, uh, in the post office at the time were pretty much 
because of the Civil Rights Act.  Uh, but like I said, I, I always looked for advancement and 
opportunities.  There was very little in the post office.  You know, I, I tried to, uh, uh, petition 
for, uh, to take exams to no avail.  But after five years, I, uh, passed the police department’s test 
and went into that. 
JM: Were you in New York City? 
PC: Yes.   
JM: Yeah. 
PC: Uh, now there, the racism was just as rampant and I would say more intimidating, uh, 
because, uh, uh, it’s more of a, a rank and file, uh, organization.  As you know, police, yeah, 
you’ve got your sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and on up, but some of the hierarchy, uh, that I 
worked under felt like I was still some type of nigger that they could talk to any way they wanted 
to.  Uh, again, like I said, that’s what my training, my involvement in civil rights here in, uh, St. 
Augustine prepared me for that.  Uh, just like I didn’t allow the disrespect, uh, regardless of who 
you were, uh, when I was a teen, I didn’t allow it working in the police department.  So my, my 
attitude was if you curse me out, no matter what your rank, I would then likewise, in turn, uh, 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 26 of 39 
 
speak as you speak to me.  You know, I respect your rank as long as you respect me as a human 
being and I did run into some, a lot of, with that attitude, you had, uh, oh boy, some of the worst 
of the worst after you.   
But another thing that was fortunate with me, most of the guys, uh, particularly blacks 
that I, uh, entered the police department with, came out of the Civil Rights Movement 
surprisingly.  And, uh, we were cohesive and they were as demanding for respect as I was, some 
more so.  So that made it a lot easier.  I was, I was proud to see, uh, a lot of the, the folk and the 
females, the black females were the ones, I mean, they did not take any shit, so to speak, if I can 
put it that way, from their superiors because I think that getting these jobs, uh, I could see that 
the, the racism involved was to try to still keep you as low as possible and, uh, and it didn’t work 
because, uh, a group, I got together with a group that sued the police department and the city of 
New York for discriminating on the promotional exams and we were successful.  I again had to 
sue, the same, similar suit for my lieutenant’s exam and we were successful.  And those lawsuits, 
uh, were used, the criteria was used around the nation and they’re still being used to this day.  So 
yes, the Civil Rights, uh, Movement in St. Augustine, uh, prepared me well. 
JM: Yeah.  Um, did the, uh, did the department change gradually in your service there 
over time? Did you think it changed because of this ongoing pattern of challenge and activism 
by –  
PC: Oh definitely. 
JM: Yeah. 
PC: I think the change came about not so much, uh, willingly. 
JM: Yeah. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 27 of 39 
 
PC: Uh, the first lawsuit, uh, uh, I guess the New York City Police Department, when it 
came to, uh, the sergeant’s test, produced [55:00] and this is what changed the complexion of the 
job, it produced over three hundred minority candidates.  Now they called us ‘quota’ sergeants at 
the time or the, the theory was that we couldn’t perform.  We were given a break and it was just 
the, uh, just the, the contrary.  I left my position as a lieutenant with honors.  I, I trained, uh, most 
of the people that worked under me, particularly white candidates, trained them well.  To this 
day I’m respected.  And my whole focus to them was you treat, you see a woman out there, 
black, white, green, or blue, you treat her like your mother.  You know, you don’t, I don’t expect 
you to bring this, uh, uh, white mentality into a black neighborhood on how to treat people and if 
I ever see or hear of any of the guys I train treating someone harshly, you’re going to have to 
deal with me.  Don’t worry about someone looking you up or, or the department doing an 
investigation because I’ll be the first to drop a dime on you.  I’ll be the first to put you on a foot 
[patrol].  So and, and honestly, honestly, I never, I trained hundreds, I never had a serious 
complaint of any white male or female office under my supervision, never in my career. 
JM: Did you come back to St. Augustine in those years? 
PC: Yes, I’d come every year.   
JM: Yeah. 
PC: Uh, my, my parents were still here, my brothers, my family was still here.  So I’d 
bring my kids down, uh, every summer just to give me and the wife a break.  Uh, and they loved 
it.  I mean, uh, and surprisingly, uh, I know I already talked about the YMCA.  When they would 
come down, uh, uh, my mother would put them in the swimming program at the YMCA.   
JM: Let’s take a break for just one second. 
PC: Okay.

[Recording resumes after pause] 
 
JB: We’re back. 
 
JM: Okay.  We’re back after a short break.  Um, I just, we were just asking, I was asking 
about your, your return visits to St. Augustine over the years, family here, and you brought your 
kids down and all.  Um, how did your opinion of the city and race relations in the city evolve 
over time? Can you sort of track that for me? 
 
PC: Well, not living here in St. Augustine, uh, it’s, I can’t give an opinion, but what I, 
I’m, I’m really disheartened at the non-improvement of black life here in St. Augustine.  I would 
come back to see abandoned houses, uh, uh, drug-ravaged areas, uh, uh, particularly black 
seniors not receiving, uh, assistance, uh, to keep their properties up.  I started seeing what I had 
witnessed, uh, in certain areas of New York at one time due to red-lining. 
 
JM: Yeah. 
 
PC: And I felt like this is what was happening in St. Augustine.  Uh, blacks couldn’t get, 
uh, loans for their properties.  Uh, I knew how the system of red-lining worked.  It starts with 
the, the banks not lending money.  It starts with the, the care of the neighborhood, uh, coupled 
with, uh, uh, the raising of taxes, uh, and then the gentrification.  And this is what has played out 
in Lincolnville over the last ten years. 
 
JM: Yeah, yeah.  What’s your sense of, um, what’s your sense of the – you, you 
mentioned that very, very central point about how your experiences here in the Movement 
probably substantially were reflected in the way you approached the challenge, the racial 
challenges structurally in police work and, and, and even prior at the community college and the 
choices you made about how to respond to the injustice of the, of the firing of your instructor and 
the easy passage of these two white students into credential.  Um, I’m, I’m interested in your, 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 29 of 39 
 
your sense of other ways in which the experience here has been reflected in your life as you’ve 
gone forward, maybe perhaps as a parent, perhaps as a, a per, person who contributes to your 
community and through professional service in other ways. 
 
PC: Uh, well, this, like I said, my experiences growing up here, I, in a way, I was raised 
by my great-grandmother.  I’m, I’m, uh, I’m not violent, but I’m not passive either.  I mean, you, 
uh, if I’m put in a position where I have to respond physically [1:00:00], I will.  Uh, fortunately, 
I was not put in that position, uh, in the police department, but I, I think, uh, my determination 
and will is what was a force that, uh, I think protected me pretty much.  I think those around me 
knew that I would respond.  So what I learned as a second level manager in the police 
department is this buddy system, you know, viewed by me as racist.  Now I can understand you 
taking care of your buddy or, uh, your friend, which is not a bad thing, but as a whole, I mean, 
when you have, uh, let’s say whites that are in authority, that make decisions that’s crucial to the, 
the group, if everything is going to be based on a buddy system, I started seeing this and I would 
challenge that with a lot of my white friends.  I’d say, “It’s not fair.” You know, when you get 
someone who is qualified to do the job, you, you need to put that person first.  I mean, if there’s 
a slot open for a buddy, then you, you. 
But you know, I started seeing this mentality of this buddy system, uh, pretty much more 
in place and I saw that my white colleagues didn’t view that as being racist, and I said it is 
because who is your buddy? It’s the guy that you live around.  It’s the guy that you drink with.  
You’re not drinking with me or you’re not drinking with the guys like me.  So that’s why you 
find yourself not putting them on the same scale as your buddy.  So your buddy is always going 
to make out and I think this is the whole, uh, my, my own personal, uh, mindset is this the whole 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 30 of 39 
 
makeup of this whole system we live in now.  Everything is a buddy system.  It’s who you know; 
it’s not what you know.  And that’s the way I see it now. 
JM: Yeah, yeah.  You’ve moved back to Florida. 
PC: Yes. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
PC: Yeah.  I’m, I’m in Palm Coast now. 
JM: Yeah.  Did you, did you, would you have guessed that you would have done that 
when you moved away? 
PC: Yes.   
JM: You always felt like you might come back? 
PC: I knew it.  Yeah.  I knew we were going to come back.   
JM: Yeah. 
PC: I think we knew we were going to come back.   
JM: Yeah. 
PC: I mean, who, who can beat this weather? 
JM: [laughs] I see, if, if you were to make a, if you were to imagine making a, a, a, a 
walk through the neighborhood here and a walk through Lincolnville and imagine pausing at a 
few places because key memories that you haven’t shared previously really came out.  What, can 
you imagine what a few of those stories might be? 
PC: My passion now and, this is before the City, is the Little Links, the [uncertain word, 
at 1:02:50], and also specifically the Galimore Center [named for St. Augustine native Willie 
Galimore, who played professional football with the Chicago Bears].  That pool has, which I 
understand was managed by the county for the last few years, has been closed for over two years.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 31 of 39 
 
Now I petitioned the city commissioners with some historical facts from fifteen years ago and I 
hope they listen.  See the Little Links was more than just a park.  It was actually, it actually was a 
sanctuary for me and I’m quite sure a lot of people and I think it still is.  I, I don’t know what the, 
uh, city’s intent is in that area, but I hope it is to, uh, restore it to its glory, uh, and repair and put 
that pool open for our use.  I hope it is that way.  I don’t know.  I’m, uh, all I can do is just 
continue to, to fight for that, but that’s, that’s one area I, I had so many, many great days and I’m 
quite sure you have quite a few young kids at the time, uh, probably my age at the time, that can 
say that that was the only sanctuary you could go to to get away from all this hatred and bigotry 
and discrimination.  That was it.  You went there: fun, fun, fun all day.   
JM: Yeah. 
PC: So that’s one spot. 
JM: Yeah. 
PC: I think actually in my heart the only spot.   
JM: Mmm, interesting, interesting, yeah. 
RH: He’s not telling you that he is leading an effort to reactivate the, the Galimore 
Center. 
JM: Yeah.  Dr., Dr.  Hayling has just said that, um, Mr. Conway is, is leading an ongoing 
effort to try to reactivate that, that whole, um, the center, the Galimore Center, and bring that 
forward.  Um, I, I, I know that there is much, much more we could talk about, um, and you’re 
such a great narrator that you’ve taken me through a nice arc here.  Are there other things you 
want to come back to touch upon before we finish, other themes, other moments, other thoughts? 
PC: Well, I, I think, uh, in a lot of communities, you have, uh, a lot [1:05:00] of black 
activism, uh, particularly political.  St. Augustine now is just at that stage of getting there.  I was 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 32 of 39 
 
asked a question, uh, on a panel once why blacks are not involved, uh, in city affairs and civic 
affairs and, uh, I’ll respond the same way.  You cannot keep a race of people out of the political 
spectrum for decades and expect when you pass an act or civil rights bill or any other bill that all 
of a sudden, they’re supposed to flood the gates, uh, and come back in their civic duty.  And I 
think, uh, again, uh, I was not raised, uh, to be into the political spectrum or to, to be civic-
minded, just like I’m quite sure generations, particularly here in Lincolnville, uh, and West 
Augustine behind me weren’t raised.  I think if, uh, once, uh, those folk understand, uh, uh, the 
importance of it, uh, you’ll start seeing them returning and being more active with their civic 
duties.  And that’s what I, a, a, another thing I’ve been trying to, uh, explain and push, 
successfully too.  I see that there is a lot more activism than there was, uh, a year or two ago.  I 
see that.  I’m, I’m really proud of it.   
JM: I really want to thank you.  It’s been a real honor and a privilege and I, let me thank 
you again also for the extra flexibility in our day’s schedule, but it’s been great to be with you.  
Thank you. 
PC: Again, I thank you. 
JM: Thank you. 
RH: I want him to, before he closes out, to at least give a tribute to his mother and his 
father. 
JM: Ah. 
RH: And their involvement in the movement. 
JM: Dr., yeah. 
RH: [uncertain few words, at 1:06:56] Now he mentioned his great-grandmother. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 33 of 39 
 
JM: Yeah, let me do that.  Are we still on, John? Okay, yeah.  Dr. Hayling has suggested 
–  
RH: Julia and George Conway. 
JM: Yeah.  Dr. Hayling, Dr. Hayling has suggested that Mr. Conway call out his, his 
parents and, and let me have you name them and, and talk a little bit about them before we close.  
That’s, that’s lovely. Thank you. 
PC: Yeah.  My dear loving mother, Julia Conway, and my, uh, dedicated father, George 
Conway.  Uh, like I said, very active, uh, uh, passion, my mother’s passion was for her sons and 
to have us excel as best we could.  Uh, you talked about one of us, one of her sons? You really 
got on her nerve.  My father, yes, he, my father was well-known both in the black and white 
neighborhood.  I, I was not aware of how loved he was with the white neighborhood; I wasn’t.  
When, uh, I saw the way he was treated, uh, uh, at certain locations and a recent funeral of a 
friend of his, uh, before my father passed, the way he was treated by his white friends amazed 
me. 
JM: What was it that drew him into contact with the white community?  
PC: He [coughs] Excuse me.  He delivered groceries, uh, for the grocery, uh, store on 
Anastasia Island.  So he knew everybody.  I mean, uh, I was surprised, uh, uh, he, uh, and I and 
my wife was in one of the local banks taking care of some business and they were giving us a 
hard time understandably.  Uh, and I had to caution the bank manager, uh, because it was a 
[clears throat] a court order that the bank was supposed to adhere to, which they were trying to 
get around.  So I had to caution him.  “So I’m going to go back to the judge and let him know 
that you’re not adhering to this.” So anyhow, little did I know, the judge was walking by.  So the 
judge said to him, “George, is everything okay over there?” The bank manager looked, “Oh 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 34 of 39 
 
that’s judge so and so.” My father said, my father said, “Oh don’t worry about nothing, Judge.  
We’ve got it.  We, it’s under control.”  
Just the fact that I’m saying my father knew [laughs], he knew everybody just about in St.  
Augustine, just behind again on Anastasia Island, they knew him like their own father or their 
son. 
JM: Yeah.  And he weathered, he weathered the consequence of having been a strong 
supporter of the movement. 
PC: Oh yes.  Uh, well, uh, his own story, again, was he was working for the grocery 
store.  Here’s a good one too.  Sorry I left that out earlier.  But, uh, the owner, uh, decided to fire 
him for participating in the marches.  Now the butcher of the store was white.  So the butcher 
[1:10:00] walked up to the owner and said, “Well, I’ll tell you what.  If he goes, I go.  So that 
means the store goes.” [laughs] You know, this guy was a butcher, he was, so, and, and my 
father was the delivery man.  So and –  
JM: He was just loyal to your dad because of friendship? 
PC: They were that friendly and he let him know, “No, you’re not going to treat George 
like that, not while I’m here, not if you want me here.  So you think you can threaten him if he 
goes on a march?” My father told me, “Yeah, you know, so I guess I’m fired.” “Well, George, I 
can always find somebody to deliver.” “Okay.” But the butcher told, uh, the owner, “If he goes, 
I’m going.” So it’s hard to find a good butcher or a good deliveryman.  My father, like I say, that 
store owner just did not know how much love the community on Anastasia had for my father.  I 
didn’t know that.   
JM: Yeah.  Tell me a little bit more about your mother. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 35 of 39 
 
PC: My mother, uh, again, like I said, she was extremely loving, extremely hard-working.  
It would sadden me to see, uh, some of the menial things that she was forced to do.  But 
fortunately, like I say again, she wound up getting a decent job at Flagler Hospital.  Again she 
was a very smart woman, but again, the system, uh, just used black folk even after, uh, the Civil 
Rights Act.  I mean, they had her doing nurses’ duty.  She was training nurses on how to tend, 
uh, uh, newborns and this is something that you learnt from your mother, but she would train 
nurses on when a child, uh, had a colic or something else, my mother would give them home 
remedies that worked.  So again, she worked, she, when they had, they put her in pediatrics, the 
pediatrics section, but refused to, uh, to pay her properly, and but they would get the credit for 
things that she would do.  And she was a loving, particularly she loved babies.  Newborns, yes, 
that was her passion.  She’d sit there and rock them all night and the nurses would say, “Aw gee, 
I don’t know how you sit there and rock that kid.” “Well, I didn’t want to hear him crying all 
night.  So I’ll sit here when I’ve got some time and rock him to sleep.” But she was again, she 
was loved.   
Uh, on the job, uh, they treated her unfairly.  Uh, they fired her before her tenth year.  
This thing with trying to get some little pension out of these jobs back then was just, it was 
insulting.  You’re approaching the ten year.  I wonder how much of a little pension you can get, 
uh, uh, something from a job.  They would fire you.  They’d find a reason to fire you, black or 
white.  Uh, pensions were the scurry [note: perhaps meaning the thing that one chased endlessly 
with little success?] of, uh, uh, uh, life here when I was growing up.  That’s why I left Florida.  
Uh, in my readings, I knew wow, you get a pensionable job.  At least you’ve got something that 
you can lean on when you get older.  So that’s what, uh, attracted me, uh, to the North and 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 36 of 39 
 
fortunately, uh, I feel I was successful in, uh, landing some pretty decent jobs and, uh, acquiring 
a decent pension.   
JM: Yeah, yeah.  Thank you again.  It’s been a real pleasure.  Yeah.  Thank you so much. 
RH: Don’t end yet. 
JM: Oh well, okay.  [laughs] Dr. Hayling is asking for –  
RH: He talked about –  
JM: Yeah. 
RH: All that he did in his youth.   
JM: Yeah. 
RH: This year alone, he has joined with a court and with the adult activities to 
Tallahassee with his wife and all to the clemency board and everything else, back to Tallahassee.  
And I spoke at the capitol in the rotunda on behalf, on, at the behest of a black caucus, legislative 
caucus.   
JM: Right, right. 
RH: I was there, and drove one of the vans or did you? 
PC: Yes, mmm hmm. 
JM: Yeah. 
RH: And everything else like it. 
JM: Dr. Hayling just wanted –  
RH: He’s leaving out –  
JM: Ah, I know there’s –  
RH: Some of his things and what have you, but all of his contributions and attributes and 
everything else didn’t stop with his youth. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 37 of 39 
 
JM: Yeah. 
RH: He is now sixty. 
PC: Sixty two.  
RH: Sixty two. 
JM: Mmm hmm. 
RH: And he has carried forth all of those things that he mentioned in his youth.  I think 
they’re almost in his genes. 
JM: Yeah. Well, well, the microphones probably couldn’t pick that up, but, but Dr. 
Hayling especially wanted to call out Mr. Conway for a whole pattern of ongoing service, 
including participation in, in the 40th ACCORD [formally the ‘40th Anniversary to 
Commemorate the Civil Rights Demonstrations, Inc. (40th ACCORD),’ a non-profit established 
2003 to promote awareness of local movement history; placed thirty historical markers known as 
the ACCORD Freedom Trail Project] effort on the clemency issue over in Tallahassee at the, in 
the state capitol and, and, um, so obviously it’s been, uh, the relationship has been a very 
mutually important one. 
PC: And I’d like to add one thing. 
JM: Please. 
PC: One, one thing.  I am totally, [1:15:00] totally amazed at this organization, the 40th 
ACCORD.  I mean, they, Mrs. Gwendolyn Duncan [president of the 40th ACCORD 
organization] and her family took this task on by themselves some years ago –  
RH: ’03  [2003]. 
PC: ’03?  
RH: It started with the street naming ceremony.  
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 38 of 39 
 
PC: In ’03. 
RH: Yes. 
PC: And has done so much, I would say has done everything to highlight the efforts of 
the Civil Rights Movement here in St. Augustine.  
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
PC: They’re focused on this.  And I, like I said again, my neighbor again, Mrs., uh, 
Barbara Vickers, I recall when she took on, uh, her lone task of trying to make a monument for 
the foot soldiers.  So these, these folk by themselves have done these great works and like I said, 
you see the monuments and you see the, the dedications of the 40th ACCORD.  But again, all I 
can do is praise and thank them.  They, they again are the fu – future foot soldiers, uh, oh the 
Civil Rights Movement and, and making it known to the, the nation and the world.  
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
PC: I’d like to thank them. 
JM: Thank you so much. 
PC: Mmm hmm. 
JM: Yeah.  Thank you. 
RH: All of the 501(c)3. 
JM: Yeah. 
RH: Non-profit organizations. 
JM: Yeah.  All the 15 –  
RH: Nobody was on a paid staff. 
JM: Yeah.  Dr. Hayling is pointing out that, um, that work has all been done on a, 
essentially a volunteer basis, a 501(c)3 basis.  That’s right. 
Purcell Maurice Conway Interview, 11-29-11 
 
 
Page 39 of 39 
 
RH: Because we didn’t have money. 
JM: We’re, we’re going to stop there.  Thank you all.
