Emilye Crosby: Alright. 
John Bishop: We’re recording. 
Emilye Crosby: I’m Emilye Crosby, working with the Southern Oral History Program, 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And I’m here today conducting this oral history as 
part of the Civil Rights History Project, which is an undertaking of Smithsonian Institution’s 
National Museum of African American History and Culture and the American Folklife Center in 
the Library of Congress. This is June twenty-fifth, 2013. And we’re here today with Mr. William 
Lucy at the Smithsonian offices. And the other people present at the interview are John Bishop, 
who is filming, Elaine Nichols of the Smithsonian African American Museum, and Sharmen 
Townsend. 
Mr. Lucy, would you be willing to tell me a little bit about your family and growing up? I 
understand you were born in Memphis and moved to California. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013

William Lucy: Born in Memphis, Tennessee. My family, my father was from Catherine, 
Alabama. My mother was from Uniontown, Alabama. I grew up in Memphis, up until about the 
age of seven plus. We moved to California in about March of 1942, just after World War II 
started. I actually grew up in Richmond, California, from about seven plus years old until I left 
Richmond in 1966. 
EC: Was the—1966 is when you left Richmond? 
WL: Yes. 
EC: Was the war the reason that your family went from Memphis to California? 
WL: Yes. My father worked for Memphis Light, Gas and Water up until, you know, the 
war started in December of 1941. He, along with any number of folks, were recruited for the war 
effort. They left from Memphis and went to the Bay Area and went to work for Kaiser 
Shipyards. 
EC: Did they have any trouble leaving Memphis, do you know? 
WL: Not at all at that time. The government was recruiting for the war effort. 
EC: Yeah, yeah. So, do you have any memories of Memphis from those early days? 
WL: Well, I went to elementary school in Memphis up to about the fifth grade, I think it 
was, fourth or fifth grade. And Memphis was pretty typical of most cities in the South. It was as 
segregated as it could get. The political participation was under the thumb of a fellow by the 
name of E. H. Crump. My father received his job from Mr. Crump and worked for Memphis 
Light, Gas and Water until we left in—he left in 1941 about mid-December. We left in about 
March of 1942. 
EC: Um-hmm. So, after you moved to California, what was it like for you there? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
3 
WL: Well, in the early years, it was a total war effort, up until the war ended in about 
1945. I finished elementary school in California, and then went to junior high and high school in 
California. And California was radically different than Memphis, Tennessee. Of course, I was 
young and didn’t know the significance of the difference. We all lived in wartime housing 
projects. Everybody lived together. The Kaiser Industries had developed four shipyards in 
Richmond proper. And virtually everybody in Richmond worked for either Standard Oil, Ford 
Motor Company, or worked for Kaiser in the shipyards. 
EC: When you say, “We all lived together,” that’s the workers? 
WL: The workers. I mean, there was a tremendous amount of defense housing built for 
the war effort. 
EC: And is this integrated housing? 
WL: It was then. 
EC: Okay, okay. So, do you have good memories of those years? 
WL: Very good memories. Our schooling was good, segregated but good. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: Through junior high school, it was a good environment. And when the war ended, 
the assumption was that people would go back where they came from. 
EC: [Laughs] 
WL: It turned out not to be quite true. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: You had a number of people who went to different states, but the bulk of the African 
American community remained in Richmond until it came point in time to really remove the 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
4 
defense housing. But our early childhood was pretty good. The education system was radically 
different than Memphis, Tennessee, both through junior high school and high school. 
EC: Well, were you aware of that at the time? I mean, was it very noticeable to you as a 
child? 
WL: The only thing that was noticeable was that we didn’t have [0:05:00] a substantial 
number of white people there. We had Mexican Americans and African Americans all living in 
the same area. 
EC: Okay, yeah. So, after the war, did your father continue to work with Kaiser? 
WL: No, at the close of the war effort, he opened his own business. He was a mechanic, I 
guess self-taught. He worked on automobiles, trucks, heavy equipment, construction equipment. 
He did that for a number of years. 
EC: Can you describe your parents for us, tell us about them a little? 
WL: Well, I think they were typical people from the South, primarily from the rural 
South. And my father, I’m not quite sure of the level of education that he achieved, but he was 
fundamentally self-taught. He worked, as I said, for Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and what 
was interesting, I saw his work papers, and he was described as an “unskilled laborer” prior to 
the war effort. Six weeks after he went to work for Kaiser, he was a journeyman welder. 
EC: [Laughs] 
WL: And the lesson I drew from that is when the government has a priority, it can be 
achieved by whatever they have to do to make it happen. My mother was a seamstress for many 
years and then opened a restaurant. I’m not quite sure the years, but she ran that for a number—
for some time. 
EC: Did you have brothers and sisters? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
5 
WL: One brother, Joe Lucy, Jr., who was two years older than myself. 
EC: Um-hmm. And so—are there significant memories that you have from your 
childhood, things that were important or formative for you? 
WL: Well, I mean, we had typical growing up experiences as youngsters. In junior high 
school and high school, we did the sports thing: baseball, basketball, football. After graduation 
from high school—I attended El Cerrito High School, as opposed to Richmond High School. 
And our sort of growing up years was just like thousands of other kids in the similar situation. 
We all went to school together. We all played together. We all grew up together, and many of us 
still maintain contact now. 
EC: Um-hmm. And after you graduated from high school, you went to Berkeley? 
WL: I went to work first for the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. 
EC: Okay. 
WL: And worked there for two years. In 1953, went to work for Contra Costa County in 
the Engineering Department. And during the course of that work, went to the University of 
California at Berkeley in their materials and research courses. I shouldn’t say worked in that, but 
studied that for a couple of years at the same time working for the county. 
EC: Was that something where they would pay you to go to school? Or it was something 
that you were interested in pursuing? 
WL: No, this was done, essentially, to enhance my opportunities for promotion on my 
regular work schedule. I worked at Contra Costa County in the Materials and Research 
Laboratory, and at that time, this was a very new area of study for highway construction, roads, 
buildings, dams, bridges. 
EC: So, what was your work in that at that time? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
6 
WL: I was initially what was called an engineering aide, which was the entry-level 
position in the laboratory system. I worked at that for about three years and then transferred to 
the—same department—to the Surveying and Right-of-Way Division. Came back into the 
laboratory and ultimately worked 13 years for the county, all but one or two of them in the 
Materials and Research Department. When I left employment with the county, I was assistant 
materials and research engineer for the county. 
EC: And how was the work you did then different than your entry-level work? 
WL: Well, there was a series of positions in the laboratory. It involved both laboratory 
testing, and it was basically quality control and design and materials for highway construction. 
Entry-level was basically taking samples and doing sort of the fundamental test activity. When I 
became what was called a supervisor and materials tester, I ran the laboratory with about seven 
or eight personnel under my supervision. The series were civil engineers, assistant civil 
engineers, junior civil engineers. All of them [0:10:00] were working on quality control tests for 
highway construction: water, asphalts, oils. 
And in 1953, I believe, when President Eisenhower passed the legislation that created the 
interstate highway system, under the system, states had to be responsible for the quality control 
of materials that went into construction. And the counties assumed the responsibility of farm-to-
freeway road development. 
JB: Can we take a little pause? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: Okay, we’re back on. 
EC: How did you get involved in working with the union? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
7 
WL: While I was working at the county, I was invited to join the union. So, I joined what 
at that time was an employee association. During the course of the association work, the issue 
became, “Why are we not a union?” I mean, we were in a very heavily unionized county, a very 
heavily unionized state. And we were a civil service organization, and there were many of us 
who believed that the civil service system did not meet our needs. The civil service in those days 
had gone far beyond its original mandate of testing for qualified employees to be submitted for 
hire. The civil service systems had begun to make decisions on wages, on benefits, etcetera, 
which I basically felt were issues that should be decided upon by the employer and employees in 
some sort of a formal bargaining process. 
So, we discussed and debated and put the issue to sort of a yearlong forum on whether we 
should be a union or continue to be an association. And the employees who were part of our 
membership voted to seek out the ways and means of becoming a legitimate union in the true 
sense. And we had an election. The pro-union group won the election, and we set out to become 
a true collective bargaining vehicle. 
EC: It sounds like you were pretty actively involved in that discussion? 
WL: Well, I’m sure there were others who were perhaps more active, but at least I put a 
good deal of time into the issue, because I thought it was so basic. 
EC: Yeah. What were the things that struck you as most important at the time about being 
part of a union? 
WL: Well, the process in the civil service system, which is a good system, was a good 
system in our county, but the issues of wages, hours, and conditions of employment, I mean, as 
an association and a civil servant, you could protest after something had happened to you. 
EC: Okay. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
8 
WL: You didn’t have a whole lot of rights in that process. We thought that there should 
be legitimate grievance procedures with a defined process for resolution of just day-to-day 
problems. And we certainly felt that, with regard to wages and benefits, employees have a basic 
right to be a part of that discussion that determines that. 
EC: Do you have—looking back, were there influences in your growing up or your 
experiences that predisposed you to that perspective? 
WL: Well, in my—while I was employed with the county, I met a number of people who 
were old trade unionists. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: I think probably the two that had the greatest impact and influence on myself was a 
fellow by the name of Ben Russell, who worked for county government at that time in the civil 
service department, and another fellow by the name of Red Aiello, who was a blacksmith. And 
you couldn’t have a wider difference between the functions, and both of them felt very strongly 
about the need to have a trade union truly representing people in the trade union system. And I 
think Mr. Aiello probably had more to do with the formation of thought. But the two of them, 
you know, had tremendous influence on how I felt about our rights as employees to a process 
where we were recognized as participants in decisions that affected our work life. 
EC: And am I correct that you went from working for the county to working for the 
union? Is that—is that so? 
WL: Yes. 
EC: Can you describe sort of how you made that evolution to actually become a full time 
employee for the union? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
9 
WL: Well, our union—after going through this yearlong discussion and debate about 
trade unionism versus association functions, [0:15:00] I learned a lot and I think grew a lot. And 
in the course of the union’s action, the contest between who did we want to join, since we had 
made the decision to be a union, what union and with who? And during those days, there were 
not many unions who thought there should be great activity in the public sector. If you recall, 
President Roosevelt, when he passed the Wagner Act, specifically excluded public employees. 
And we used to make the case of what’s the difference between a bus driver in the private sector 
who drives his bus ten blocks and then a public employee who drives it another ten. They’re both 
doing the same thing, requiring the same skills, and should therefore have the same basic rights 
to wages and benefits. 
And so, we caught the attention of the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, at that time, who was led by a fellow out of Wisconsin, a Mr. Arnold 
Zander, who had grown up in the public service. He was the president, but he was being 
challenged by a fellow out of New York by the name of Jerry Wurf, who had a very clear vision 
of what workers in the public or private sector ought to be entitled to. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: And so, they saw us, they saw what we were doing and what we were talking about, 
and in 1964, in the contest for the leadership of the union, Mr. Wurf was successful. So, we 
replaced a pro-civil service leader with a pro-union leader. And Mr. Wurf, in about a year or so, 
saw the work that we were trying to do and the kinds of issues we were focusing on, and asked 
would I be interested in coming to work for the national union. And I was a little reluctant 
because I had only been out of my zip code one time. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
10 
And so, we talked about it, and the question of what can we do if we have the sort of pro-
worker sense about ourself in the public sector? Collective bargaining was very, very new. And 
it was my belief that if our union was able to impact on issues, both work issues and social 
issues, maybe the union as an institution could be a good vehicle for social change. 
EC: So, as a result of that thinking, you went ahead and made the leap, despite your 
concerns? 
WL: Yes. Yes, I left the county service in about June of 1966 and came to work for the 
national union as the associate director of the Department of Legislation and Community Affairs. 
EC: And so, what—you know, you said that one of your hesitations is that you’d only 
been out of your zip code one time. 
WL: [Laughs] Well, from Memphis to California. 
EC: [Laughs] And what was the new job going to entail? Was it going to be relocating or 
travel? 
WL: Oh, it meant relocating from Richmond, California, to Washington, D.C. 
EC: Okay. 
WL: The scope of the work was very unclear. What we did see, however, was the 
growing influence of the federal sector in the affairs of state and local government. I don’t mean 
negatively, but funding programs, rules and regulations that related to how things were to be 
done. In our union—we were a growing union in the public sector—we felt we had to have a 
presence in those discussions, whether it was social welfare or whether it was employment 
security, that we had to have at least a voice in the process in order to be sure how it would affect 
our workers. 
EC: So, during this same period, the southern Civil Rights Movement is taking place. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
11 
WL: Um-hmm. 
EC: So, from probably when you’re a—what, a young adult?—to this transition to the 
national union, so what was your awareness of that? 
WL: Well, if you live in the South, you’re aware of civil rights, either presence or 
absence, all the time. Much of our thought centered on two areas. There was a great struggle 
among agricultural workers at that time, and particularly farm workers. [0:20:00] Cesar Chavez 
and another fellow by the name of Larry Itliong was in the process of forming the United Farm 
Workers union, and they were engaged in a big struggle in central California with the Gallo 
Company around the grape industry. Later on, it went on to lettuce and other things. 
So, our union and many of our folks identified with that, so we were quite aware of the 
power and the pressure that major agribusiness could put on workers. The same in the civil rights 
struggle; the real issue of the southern civil rights fighting was really about economic 
exploitation, the same as it was with the Mexican farmworkers. 
EC: And so, did you think about that through that time period? I mean, were you—? 
WL: We thought about it, but there wasn’t at that point a whole lot we could do. I 
believed, like Dr. King believed, that trade unions as a vehicle, as an institution, can have great 
impact on the processes that govern people’s lives. But I didn’t understand how those could be 
implemented. 
What probably had a major piece of influence was when we took on the simple question 
of survivor benefits for the survivors of those who ultimately dug the Panama Canal. The 
descendants were without any benefits whatsoever, even though our ships were sailing easily 
through the canal. There’s probably about three hands full of these people left. The government 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
12 
has a basic responsibility, I think, to do something for them. So we, under the affairs of our 
department, began to look at this issue. 
Secondly, the whole question of minimum wages and the areas that were left out for 
consideration for minimum wage status. These areas were, by and large, African American 
workers, in contrast to the others, who were workers from all up and down the southern 
hemisphere. But these were workers who were denied minimum wage coverage, people who 
worked in private hospitals, nursing homes. As we thought about this, this really required some 
involvement of the union, if we were going to raise the issue. And we did, and we ultimately 
were victorious in getting coverage under the Interstate Commerce Clause for these workers. 
EC: Was there a minimum wage change in 1966 that extended it to agricultural workers? 
WL: I don’t recall that, but I think it was about ’66, ’67, under the Interstate Commerce 
Clause, that they extended it to private hospitals and nursing homes. 
EC: Okay. What I’m thinking of, and I’m not exactly sure of the date, but there was a 
period, I think, sort of right after the Voting Rights Act passed, sort of in that timeframe, where 
there was, I think, a dollar-an-hour minimum wage for agricultural workers, which became the 
impetus for plantation owners in the Delta to sort of finish mechanization and just completely 
run people off the plantations, which is part of what led to the poverty, the sort of extreme 
hunger that led Marian Wright to propose the Poor People’s Campaign with King. And so, I was 
wondering if you were aware of any of that? 
WL: I’m just not aware of that, but it’s clear that the minimum wage is both a blessing 
and a curse, I mean, because the employers simply take advantage of workers in certain 
categories. And there’s a real need to see the minimum wage, really, as almost a floor for the 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
13 
improvement of the quality of life for folks who are either sub-skilled or unskilled, but doing 
menial work for which the employer decides the value of it. 
EC: Can you—in your extensive work, do you have ideas for better ways to protect 
workers’ rights and access to living wages and minimum wage? 
WL: Well, I think collective bargaining is a simple, pure system. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: I mean, where workers have only their work to put into the game, employers have to 
measure the value of that, and you can’t do it unless the two of them come together. On the 
workers’ side, they have the right to withdraw their labor. On the employers’ side, they have the 
decision to make about profit versus [0:25:00] fairness, and generally they choose profit. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: And so, absent a vehicle for workers to participate fully in the decisions that affect 
them, you are going to always have exploitation. 
JB: [Can we pause]? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: We’re back on. 
EC: When you came to Washington, working for the union full time, were there people 
who were important influences when you moved into that new job? 
WL: Yeah. The fellow who was president, Wurf, sent out to talk to me about it was a 
fellow by the name of Al Billick. And our union was very—I mean, our union was not new, but 
our philosophy had changed substantially, and we were making the case that public employees 
had the same rights as private sector employees. I mean, there’s fundamentally no difference in 
what many of us did. And the fact that the civil service system, as I said earlier, had gone far 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
14 
beyond its mandate, we felt that we were entitled fully, if workers so chose to organize, to 
organize, be recognized, and bargain the contract like workers in the private sector. 
And that was so very new. And the proof of its newness was that public sector workers 
were joining us by the thousands, because they had never had or heard this kind of a presentation 
to them as their rights. And there were no—there were one or two states that allowed the process 
but did not necessarily have the laws that protected workers in that process. There were many 
elected officials who saw the unfairness of the system who were prepared—who actually 
bargained with public sector entities and proceeded to politically achieve the results of 
bargaining. I mean, the old argument was that the city, the county, the state is sort of a supreme 
power, and the taxpayers pay the way. Well, the fact is that they are sovereign entities, but their 
basic responsibility is to provide public service. And so, they are employers at the same time. 
EC: How did you end up being involved in the Memphis strike? 
WL: Well, like a lot of people, I got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
[Laughter] I was, as I say, doing legislation and community affairs, which is something that I 
was in the learning phase of. This was in 1968. I ran into the president in the hallway one day, 
and he says, “What are you doing for the next couple of days?” And I said, “What I’ve been 
doing for the last couple of days.” 
EC: [Laughs] 
WL: He said, “Well, I’d like for you to go to Detroit and do some work there,” and I 
agreed to do it. And he called me back a little while later and says, “There’s something going on 
in Memphis. You’re from Memphis. Perhaps you could go down, take a look and see what it 
means.” 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013

The Sanitation Department in Memphis, Tennessee, was sort of in turmoil. You had men 
who had worked there the better part of their adult life and still earning wages that allowed them 
to qualify for every poverty program that existed there. As Dr. King once said, it was really the 
true story of the working poor. They were caught in a political squeeze between a brand-new 
mayor, who had got elected in a brand-new system of government. And he won his election on 
probably some of the strongest racial themes that had been seen for a long time. So, he felt he 
owed the black community nothing and certainly in his newfound power was not going to 
tolerate a union, talk about safety and health and wages and those kinds of things. So, a stalemate 
developed between a brand-new mayor and a brand-new system of city government. 
Prior to the strike starting, there had been an attempt by these workers to influence the 
city, and they were enjoined by the local court from that. The catalyst to this new effort was men 
getting killed in the back of their garbage truck by the packing mechanism that scooped up the 
garbage and forced it into the back of the truck. This system and the equipment had been 
[0:30:00] complained about for some time, but the city—new government, new mayor, old 
problems—they didn’t see the need to address any of those problems at this time. This sort of 
festered for a while, and then the catalyst, as I said, was the men being crushed in the back of the 
truck. The remaining workforce just said, “We’ve just had enough of this.” 
Well, the last thing you need in a city like Memphis, Tennessee, in February is a garbage 
strike. I mean, strikes don’t come because workers are mad. Strikes come because they are 
frustrated and have no ability to resolve the issues that contribute to their frustration. So, they 
were preparing to strike or to do something. And I went from Detroit to Memphis just to get sort 
of a look at what was going on. And it was clear that this was a major issue that wasn’t going to 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
16 
resolve itself in 24 hours, because the city was entrenched in its position and the workers were in 
theirs. 
And I sort of passed this on to the president, and we thought about it for a minute. We 
were subsequently notified by the Washington Post, a fellow from the Washington Post. I can’t 
recall his name now, but he was coming back, oddly enough, from a meeting in Marks, 
Mississippi, that Dr. King had been in as a part of his early movement towards the Poor People’s 
Campaign. And so, they called us and said, “Looks like there’s a strike in Memphis, Tennessee.” 
We said, “What do you mean, a strike in Memphis, Tennessee?’ They said, “You ought to check 
it out.” So, we did again, and it was true. The men were in the process of refusing to go to work. 
And ultimately, they took that position. 
And I was there to work with them, myself; a fellow by the name of Jesse Epps, out of 
Clarksdale, Mississippi; one other fellow by the name of Joe Paisley, out of East Tennessee, I 
think, Nashville. And what we tried to do was just give some direction and some support to the 
workers until we figured out exactly what we were up against. And the strike just got bigger and 
bigger. It was a classic confrontation between a city with total power and a group of workers 
with no power, other than a good idea. 
And the strike lasted for 67 days. And clearly the story was Dr. King ultimately saw this 
as a great contradiction, you know, in the rich nations and certainly rich cities, yet you have 
people working for wages for which will not allow them to bring themselves out of poverty. I 
mean, if you work every day, you ought to earn a wage sufficient to allow you to raise our family 
and so forth. 
During the course of the strike, in the early days, Roy Wilkins came down, Bayard 
Rustin, ultimately Dr. King. This was a very quiet strike. I mean, it was not well-known outside 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
17 
of the city of Memphis. And we tried to ask people to come down and take a look, identify with 
it, who would bring some press with them, because the southern press don’t give you a whole lot 
of play on workers’ activities. When Dr. King came, because he was traveling with the national 
press, people had the opportunity to see exactly what was taking place. And my hat and heart 
goes out to the men who participated in that, because, I mean, whatever they had, it was on the 
line in that struggle. 
EC: How did having Dr. King come in change the dynamics of the strike and what you 
were trying to do or able to do? 
WL: Well, we had spent a good deal of time trying to keep this as an employer and 
employee issue. And because we felt pretty strongly that if it became a question of a racial 
polarization, that there would be little sympathy for the men themselves because nobody knew 
anything about sanitation workers. But it was impossible to do that. I mean, all of the elements, 
you know, suggested that you were going to ultimately wind up there. What Dr. King did was 
made this analogy that here is the problem [0:35:00] in America. You’ve got people who work 
every day that don’t earn a sufficient enough wage to get themselves out of poverty. We did an 
analysis of all the workers in that participation and 85 to 90 percent qualified for public aid, yet 
they worked every day. 
And, as we sort of talked to people, we really began to understand that people had no 
sense of the role that sanitation workers play in the social service system. I think many of them 
thought that they just put their garbage out and it just disappeared overnight, as opposed to 
somebody getting up at four o’clock in the morning and coming by, picking it up, putting it on 
their shoulder, taking it around front and throwing it in the truck. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
18 
EC: So, was this people in Memphis that you’re talking to about this, or every—the 
world? 
WL: I think at that point in time, it was people generally. 
EC: I mean across the country, yeah. 
WL: I mean, the last person you generally think about is somebody who picks up your 
garbage. I was on a radio show once out of New York, and Westchester, which at that time 
was—and probably still—pretty well-to-do. So, a lady called in and was talking about, or 
making comments about, “You’re paid for the value of what you do.” And I said, “Well, that’s 
not quite true.” [Laughter] She said, “Well, you know what I mean.” And I said, “No, I don’t 
know what you mean.” 
I mean, if you wait until about June or July, a garbage sanitation worker is somewhat 
more important than a lawyer, in the context of the impact they have on public health. And so, it 
was very quiet for a little while on the phone. And she said, “Well, thank you for your answer.” 
“Well, I thank you for your question,” because there is a lack of assessed value of public 
services. And the well-to-do tend not to need public services. And so, you have these 
contradictions. If you get into a debate about a tax increase for sanitation work, you’re probably 
not going to make it, so—as opposed to if you want to build a sports arena. 
EC: Um-hmm. Yeah. 
JB: Can we pause? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: We’re back. 
EC: There was quite a bit of organizing throughout the Memphis community in relation 
to this strike. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
19 
WL: We had to first get people to understand what was taking place, because these men, 
as I said before, had never been seriously thought of. What we asked them to do, because they 
touched every home in the city once or twice a week, and we asked them if they would do two 
things if they had decided to make this confrontation. First of all, they needed to go back home 
and talk to their wives, because the last thing you need is home pressure if you’re in the middle 
of a confrontation. And the second thing is to take a simple leaflet and leave it at the home of 
every home you touch in the course of your day’s work and explain to people what it is that’s 
taking place. So, at least they’re neutral at best, and hopefully some would be supportive. 
And that’s what we got. We got pretty much solid support in the African American 
community, because these are the people who live next door. We got lukewarm support in the 
white community, because, bear in mind, they just had an election for a new form of government 
and new political leadership, and the belief was that the national union had come down to take 
advantage of the city of Memphis, some of this fostered by the Justice Department under the 
leadership of J. Edgar Hoover. But, for a union that’s somewhat mature, the last thing you’re 
going to have in the winter is a garbage strike in Memphis, Tennessee. 
EC: Right. 
WL: And we were able slowly but surely to attract the religious community, at least to 
listen to the discussion and debate. Ultimately, we wanted them to support us, too. But, I mean, it 
took a while, because the South, not just in the white community, but in the black community, 
also, was not tuned into public sector trade unionism. 
EC: I know that the slogan that you see on the signs, “I am a man,” and I know a 
historian who’s written some interesting things about sort of what that means in terms of men 
and women, and that some people have really focused on this as something about [0:40:00] 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
20 
manhood. And she says you can look at pictures and see the huge numbers of women out on the 
streets, protesting this, and so, she argues that it’s a lot more complex than that. 
WL: Oh, it is. In spite of the wages and benefits and lack of safety and all that kind of 
stuff, there were no tangible demands on the table that was the core of the strike. It was the lack 
of respect, the absence of dignity, that caused these workers to say, “We’ve just had enough.” 
And it was just really so hard to define. I mean, if you talk to a reporter, and he says, “What’s 
this about?” And you say, “Respect and dignity,” and he says, “Oh, yeah, right.” Well, there was 
just no understanding of it. And the men themselves you could listen to them talk and you could 
see that, for many of them, this is their first stand against a system that had virtually robbed them 
of any self-respect, both as workers and even in their homes, you know, children who really 
didn’t believe they were doing anything worthwhile. 
And so, James Lawson, who joined the strike in the early days, had a press conference 
one day, and he was defining racism. And he says that racism, in the context of what we’re 
talking about was when a person treats a man like he’s not a man. And we didn’t think about that 
much at that point, but it became very clear that we had to have something that held this thing 
together. So, one of the local ministers and myself was charged with going out, figuring out 
something. [Laughs] So, we sat down one evening at the Peabody Hotel there in Memphis, 
Tennessee, and we just started sort of playing with words and what-have-you. And what came to 
us was the statement that James Lawson had made earlier, and we tried to put it as simple as 
possible. And if you’ve seen one of the signs, they’re sort of block letters, you know, four words, 
and it simply said, “I am a man.” 
And the impact of that on the workers, I mean, it defined for them all that they were 
about, because these were not young workers. These were men who were middle-aged or older at 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
21 
that time. And I think they were replaying some of the disrespect they had heard, because, you 
know, in the South you could go from boy to uncle to grandpa, without ever stopping at man. 
And so, they were so proud that this sign defined what they saw as their struggle. 
EC: And can you talk about how you can have that slogan, and my understanding is it 
doesn’t exclude women, that they’re still—that the women identify with this issue, not in the 
same way, but in a significant way that invites their participation? 
WL: Well, I mean, if it had not been for the women, we’d still be on strike in Memphis. I 
mean, women—wives and neighbors—did so much to give their support to the effort. This was 
in no way a sort of a macho kind of thing. It was much more an emotional kind of thing and an 
expression of the frustrations that they had experienced over time, not being able to play the 
simple role that a man would play in a family setting. There was just tremendous women 
support, and everybody had a role to play. 
EC: Can you talk more about the different kinds of contributions different people, 
different groups made? 
WL: Well, by the time we got into about midway the strike, we had logistical needs like 
you wouldn’t believe. We had feeding needs. We had all kinds of economic needs. The 
churches’ role became sort of spiritual. Every day we had to have an activity that gave people a 
chance to vent. So, the women would cook, the women would do the office work, the women 
would march on the picket lines. I mean, they did everything that they needed in order to make 
the strike successful. And, I mean, there’s a tremendous story that needs to be told about the role 
that women played in the Memphis sanitation strike. 
EC: And what about Reverend Lawson? You mentioned him a minute ago. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
22 
WL: James Lawson was one of the unique individuals who had been a longtime aide and 
ally [0:45:00] of Dr. King. Jim had studied Gandhi tactics, or studied under Gandhi, I’m not sure 
which one, maybe both. But was a very strong spiritual leader in the Memphis community. And 
he identified with the strike very early and sort of earned the reputation of becoming the most 
hated African American in Memphis, [laughter] which was fine with Jim. 
But he brought to the strike a sort of new kind of vision, in a very both emotional and 
intellectual context. And he helped to mobilize other ministers to come to the aid of the strikers. 
The story that the black church was right there instantly is sort of, you know, literary license by 
whoever writes it. Because the African American church had little if any experience with unions, 
period, and public sector unions, probably none whatsoever. And so, people did not want to be 
dragged into a fight that they didn’t understand. 
So, it took some time for them to become very clear on what the issues were and why the 
issues were having such impact on these men. I mean, many people thought they would go back 
to work the next day. But they didn’t. They chose to strike. And no union can force people to 
strike. Workers strike out of frustration that their problems are not being dealt with. 
EC: I’m sure there is—I know there’s a lot more I could ask you on Memphis, but I want 
to make sure we touch on a couple of other things as well. 
WL: Let me just make this last point— 
EC: Oh, yes sir. 
WL: About Memphis. Dr. King saw this, as I said, as the ultimate contradiction for 
people who work every day, but still cannot lift themselves out of poverty. So, he aligned the 
Memphis strike with the Poor People’s Campaign and he was just totally committed to it. He 
came to Memphis twice. The first speech he gave was just, as we say, a barnburner. And his 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
23 
second preparation for the march—he was killed on April fourth—Dr. King gave what has now 
come to be known as the “Mountaintop Speech,” which was one of the better bringing-together 
of the struggle of workers and contrasting it with the richness of the country, the freedom, the 
struggles, because many of these men had fought for the country in World War II. He just saw 
this as the great contradiction. 
And the tragedy is that the powers-that-be in Memphis did not listen to what he was 
suggesting, because his assassination did not have to take place. And I’m not one of those who 
still convinced that that James Earl Ray as a lone person did this. I mean, you’ve got a burglar 
who gets from Memphis to Europe with no support. That’s kind of a stretch. 
EC: How did—? 
JB: Let’s pause for a second. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: Okay. 
EC: I know that one of the things that people talk about, in terms of King coming to 
Memphis and the two visits, is the issue of nonviolence. 
WL: Right. 
EC: So, maybe you could speak to that. 
WL: Well, there were young folks in Memphis who thought that the tactics were not 
sufficient, and they were anxious to get engaged in the strike support effort. There was a group 
there called the Invaders, Coby Smith, a whole bunch of young kids who were community-
minded and certainly committed to the benefit of the community. But promoting violence—that 
wasn’t them. As the record shows, and certainly the Senate committee hearings conducted by 
Senator Frank Church a year or so later, showed that many of those who participated in the 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
24 
violence were provocateurs, some from the FBI service and I guess some from other places. But 
on the day of the last King march, the window breaking and all of the violence and damage, this 
was a combination of things, and it was not young people by themselves. It was provocateurs. 
And the sad part, there has never been a full [0:50:00] review of that participation. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: And I think the effort was to ruin King’s image as not being able to, at that point in 
time, hold a nonviolent assembly, whether it be a march or a rally. 
EC: I know that there was concern for King and others in SCLC about what the 
implications of this would be for the Poor People’s Campaign, bringing so many people to 
Washington. 
WL: Well, I think that was the, I think, the thrust and probably the lynchpin that made 
some folks decide to help the violence. I mean, trade unionists are well-disciplined people. I 
mean violence is not an asset. And what they used it for on that day was to polarize the city, the 
county, and the state. And, I mean, they succeeded in doing just that, because the strike, we 
think, would have been shortened, absent the violence. The mayor brought in the National 
Guard, and a whole new set of dynamics were put into the play. 
EC: What were your interactions with Dr. King in that context? 
WL: I met with him only once, at the Rivermont Hotel at the end of the march that was 
broken up that day. I forget the date. And it was just an analysis of what took place. I was in 
meetings where he was present with a lot of other folks, but that day he simply talked about the 
downside of what had happened. 
EC: And what was that like, that meeting like? 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
25 
WL: It had been a pretty exciting day, I mean, and we were trying to assess it. We were 
trying to figure out what do we do next. And of real concern was what are we exposing these 
men to, or what are we allowing them to expose themselves to? And the word was: There has to 
be another march. 
EC: Yeah. So, what kind of impact did his assassination have on, from your perspective, 
the Memphis strike, and maybe you personally? 
WL: Well, let me do the last one first. It had an incredible—it was a life-altering 
experience on me personally, because, you know, it was just unbelievable that something like 
this could happen, totally unnecessary. But in the context of the strike tactics, we heard one 
reporter from a local paper wrote an article that said he was just so sorry that Dr. King had been 
killed in Memphis, with emphasis on in Memphis. So, for us who were staff, I mean, our 
commitment was pushed to the hilt. I mean, we had to do something with this thing. 
But we at first had to resolve the question of street violence, not so much by strikers—by 
other people who were just so frustrated over the assassination of Dr. King. And then, you had a 
whole lot of wackos from other places, Arkansas, Mississippi, etcetera, who saw this as an 
opportunity to act out some of their pent-up hostility. So, we in Memphis had to get a system of 
safety for strikers. We had to sort of help the church and the other parts of the community 
provide a sense of protection for people who were going to be exposed since the police were just 
openly hostile. So, we had to work on that, and at the same time have to decide what the men 
want to do. And they were ready to go back, as they say, downtown, because the marches were 
from Clayborn Temple to City Hall, so to speak. 
So, after the memorial service, you know, which was held, I guess, a week or so later, a 
couple of weeks later, after his funeral service in Atlanta, we got back to strike tactics. President 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
26 
Johnson gave us a tremendous amount of help—I shouldn’t say gave us, but in an effort to 
resolve the issue, assigned Undersecretary of Labor James Reynolds as a mediator in this 
process. [0:55:00] And Mr. Reynolds searched out and found a fellow by the name of Frank 
Miles to work with, because the mayor just refused to negotiate, refused to discuss—you know, 
postured for the cameras, and etcetera. And it was really time to resolve this. And, in contrast to 
the fact, we had resolved this strike twice before. [Laughter] So, I mean, Dr. King’s passing, I’m 
sure, put some pressure into that situation. 
EC: Yeah. I know you said initially you were trying very hard to keep it as a labor issue. 
WL: Right. 
EC: Clearly, with King’s involvement, it becomes very identified with civil rights. 
WL: Well, it became that before King came. 
EC: Okay. 
WL: There were civil rights activists in town. There were—not necessarily who knew 
anything about the union, but they just saw men on strike. And the fact that 99.9 percent of them 
were African Americans, you know, sort of said what it said. 
EC: So, how did that—I mean, in the end, did you think that was a good thing? Or did it 
change your thinking on that at all? 
WL: I think for a while, I thought we—ultimately thought we should have identified it as 
a racial issue from the start. 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: And our hope was that rational thinking white Memphis would see this for what it 
was. It was a labor dispute, and the conditions, I mean, could be reviewed by anybody. What did 
happen, we found a way to take some well-to-do white women to visit the homes of not-so-well-
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
27 
to-do African American women, husbands of sanitation workers. And they obviously couldn’t 
believe what they were seeing. And we had hoped that they would become a voice of moderation 
and observation in this process. 
There was enough pressure generated to get the mayor to participate in some forums, 
Q&A kind of stuff. And when people heard the conditions under which the men worked, the 
other factors, you could see people’s minds changing. For a long part of the strike, people just 
blindly committed to the positions that Mayor Loeb took without any discussion of whether or 
not they were accurate. 
EC: Um-hmm. You mentioned just a few minutes ago that the strike had been resolved 
twice before. Can you talk about what—? 
WL: Right. We—in the early days, one or two days after the strike started, several of the 
staff people, including myself, was in the mayor’s office, talking to the mayor, trying to explain 
to him what was going on. And it was a very simple process at that point. The men say they want 
to have the union speak for them, and they want to talk about safety and health, because they’ve 
just had these men get killed. 
And the mayor took the position that this was an illegal strike, and that he would not talk 
to people who were breaking the law, which was about as backwards thinking as you could find. 
So, we said, “Look, this is not complicated. Let us sit down and talk about what we’re trying to 
solve.” And so, he allowed, appointed this fellow, a fellow by the name of Genotti, which was 
one of the city attorneys. Mr. Genotti and a couple of us went into a side room and started 
working on what do we think it would take to get this resolved. And so, we came up with what 
we called a recognition clause, etcetera. We agreed with it. The committee agreed with it. And 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
28 
since, Mr. Genotti represented the mayor, we assumed that he certainly wouldn’t agree to 
anything that the mayor didn’t agree to. [Laughter] 
So, we took it back to show him this one paragraph or paragraph and a half deal, and the 
mayor went bananas, you know. [Laughter] And so, we kept saying—The hardest thing to do is 
to try to work with somebody who don’t know what they’re doing. And so, it was clear to us that 
they just had their hands full and had no background on what’s taking place. 
The second time sprang from a meeting that we had, which involved the mayor. And 
President Wurf was there. We talked about the issues, and each day this strike goes on, you get 
some new issues, [1:00:00] because— 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: People are going through a little bit more pain. So, we finally found something that 
we thought everybody could agree on. It didn’t involve money, none of that. And the mayor said 
he thought he could live with that. Well, somebody from the mayor’s side called the press 
following the meeting and gave them the story. And the next morning’s headlines was, “Mayor 
Capitulates.” [Laughter] And, you know, everything just unraveled. 
And he was taking polls in the white community, how many was for him and how many 
was against him. And as long as he had his pro-support out there in big numbers, he figured why 
does he have to worry? So, he just walked backwards from the agreement we had reached. 
And ultimately he never did come back into the discussions. He put some city council 
people—well, there was a—one point let me make. There was a fellow there who was not 
necessarily pro-union, but he was pro-fair. And he had worked with a number of the council 
members and had gotten enough—he was one vote short of getting the city council to get 
engaged and involved in finding a solution to this thing. And his name was Lou Donaldson. I 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
29 
spoke to him years later, and he said that he was just so dismayed and really took the burden 
himself for Dr. King’s assassination, because if he—he just said he could never have—he did not 
find the one more vote that he thought he needed, and that if he had been able to be more 
convincing, perhaps it never would have happened. I’m not sure I agree with that, but that was 
his stories. 
But in the end, after the assassination, we found ways and means of putting language 
together to form an agreement. And the mayor stood back from it and allowed it to move forward 
through the city council. And by then, it was about money. And the mayor never put any money 
into the settlement. But one of the fairly wealthy industrialists there in Memphis, a fellow by the 
name of William Plough, who owned Plough Industries, put up enough money to satisfy the 
demands that were on the table, and we then moved the contract toward ratification. 
EC: From what you were just saying and what I’ve read, it seems like Mayor Loeb was a 
big stumbling block. 
WL: Well, he was it! 
EC: Yeah. 
WL: I mean, there was no—I mean, the city council once recommended a resolution, and 
apparently, they were jackhammered into backing away from that. But Mayor Loeb never 
engaged in it. He said it was an illegal strike and he wasn’t going to break the law, which is a 
strange outlook for a major employer. But in the end, the city council ratified the agreement, the 
workers ratified the agreement, and Loeb just went his merry way. 
And the irony is that Loeb became a protester himself. There was a big agricultural issue 
in ’69 or ’70, I forget, when the tractors all came to town here in Washington, D.C., and circled 
the Capitol, and did all this—well, he was a leader in the tractor protest movement. [Laughter] 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
30 
EC: So, do you take credit for teaching him protest tactics? [Laughter] 
WL: I kind of think that at some point in time he regretted having painted himself into a 
corner early in this strike. 
EC: He certainly did. 
WL: And it became a question of face-saving, even to do the right thing. 
EC: Yeah. So, Mr. Lucy, I know you said you had a meeting to go to, and it’s right about 
12:00. Can I ask you just a couple of big questions about the rest of—some of the other 
highlights of—I don’t even know if that would be the right—and then, you can pick and choose 
and answer what you—? 
WL: Sure. 
EC: So, I know that you were instrumental or crucial in organizing the Coalition of Black 
Trade Unionists, and also the Free South Africa Movement. And, of course, we’re approaching 
the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and I know sometimes 
people miss that “Jobs” part of the “Jobs and Freedom,” and the economic issues. 
WL: Um-hmm. 
EC: And sort of related to this, to sort of the significance, I guess—well, I’m thinking in 
terms of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, sort of—AFSCME, I understand, was a pretty 
white union when you joined it, nationally. I don’t know if that’s right. 
WL: Actually, when we joined it, the percentage of people of color was higher, [1:05:00] 
but the union was smaller. 
EC: Okay. 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
31 
WL: The Coalition of Black Trade Unionists came about, really, as a protest and reaction 
to the AFL-CIO’s almost refusal to get engaged in the battle between George McGovern and 
Richard Nixon. And I believe—I forget what year that election was. 
EC: ’72? 
WL: ’72, I think. You know, the endorsement process is critically important. And we had 
watched Richard Nixon for four years, with his price controls and wage controls and his just 
overt disdain for the African American and poor community. So, at the convention of the AFL-
CIO prior to the Democratic national convention, the AFL-CIO had taken a position of 
neutrality, which in our community suggests that one is no different than the other, or one is no 
better than the other. And we’ve got Richard Nixon with a dreadful record with regards to 
working people, poor people, black people, as opposed to McGovern, who had a progressive 
record, both in his participation in Congress, in the Senate, I should say, and otherwise. 
So, our view was that clearly your decision to remain neutral does not take into 
consideration the impact that one candidate has had on our broad community. And we believed 
that there was a real need for our voice to be in that process, and not that the AFL-CIO was 
wrong or bad; it just simply had not considered in the context of our interests what Nixon was 
and had done and would do. And so, some of us decided that we had to figure out how to make 
sure our voice was in the room. 
So, about four or five other colleagues—Nelson “Jack” Edwards from the United Auto 
Workers, Charlie Hayes from what is now the United Food and Commercial Workers, which at 
that time was Retail Clerks or something like that, Cleveland Robinson from District 65, there 
was one other, Bill Simons from the American Federation of Teachers—we concluded that we 
ought to really have a meeting and just talk about what had just happened and to see how we can 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
32 
sort of influence this process in years to come. And we thought that rather than ourselves having 
all the wisdom, we ought to ask some other people. 
So, we set a meeting for Chicago and just sort of talked to people, said, “Here’s what 
we’re thinking about doing. If you want to be a part of this conversation, come to Chicago.” We 
didn’t have a mailing list or Tweeters or Tweets or email or any of this stuff. It was just word of 
mouth. At this meeting 1300 trade unionists showed up, and the surprise—we didn’t even know 
there was that many out there! But obviously, it was an idea that lots of other people had thought 
about, some of them had actually done. Mr. Randolph, A. Philip Randolph, had had the Negro 
American Labor Council, NALC, I think it was labeled, and they had worked for a number of 
years on some of these same kinds of issues, but it was never—it was not as serious as it was in 
1972. 
So, when we had the convention, we did not say, “We have formed the Coalition of 
Black Trade Unionists.” We said, “We ought to take about a year and talk about this, and it’s got 
to be talked about in all parts of the country.” And so, lots of people were given assignments to 
go here, go there, meet with workers, meet with labor leadership, black leadership, and raise the 
question: Is this a time for such as this? And it was not set out to be a Coalition of Black Trade 
Unionists. 
At the end of the day, we came back into a second convention, and the answer in 
response to the question was, “Yes. We need an organization such as this to make sure our 
voices don’t get lost.” And we intentionally called it the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, I 
mean, with malice of forethought, I should say. [Laughs] And the idea was to get people to—I 
mean, there’s nothing wrong with diversity. There’s nothing wrong with people getting together 
to discuss mutual concerns. But we said we’ve got to be very clear the issues we’re going to deal 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
33 
with, we’re going to come at from a black perspective. [1:10:00] And everybody that—I mean, 
it’s open to membership for everybody, but that’s the focal point. And the convention voted to 
name it that. 
And we’ve grown to some 55 chapters now, some just dynamite coalitions of workers, 
some, you know, label only. But it has brought to the consciousness of folks that there are unique 
problems that women have in the workforce, Hispanics have in the workforce, African 
Americans. And you can’t sort of use a philosophy of 1948. I mean, it’s a little bit different now. 
EC: And do you think you’ve been able to have an impact through that on the sort of 
approach of the broader labor movement? 
WL: Oh, I think so! I mean, our initial argument was that we’re not in the room when 
these decisions are made. The executive council in those days was substantially smaller. Now, I 
mean, in 1955, we increased the council by 12 persons, aside from those who may have gotten 
elected on their own. But now, it’s a diverse policy-making body, with women, with Hispanics, 
with Asians, with African Americans. So, when you take on domestic economic policy, when 
you take on foreign policy, I mean, you’re speaking about folks who are experiencing the impact 
of it on a daily basis. Many hold high levels of leadership in their own individual organizations. 
In those days, Mr. Randolph, I think, was probably the only African American on the council, 
perhaps Mr. Dellums, C. L. Dellums. But the fact is that people have educated themselves as to 
the role and value of trade unionists, and they are full participants, and we call ourselves full 
partners. And we have lasted 43 years, a little bit longer than a lot of others. But I think—you 
know, we’re still going at it. 
With Mr. Mandela, let me just spend a moment on that. We have long since, we being the 
Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, believed that apartheid was an abomination that should not 
William Lucy, June 25, 2013 
34 
exist. And we have long held that there ought to be held free and fair elections, not just in South 
Africa, but across the undeveloped world. I mean, people ought to have an opportunity to 
participate in the decision as to who will lead them. Apartheid was a special brand of evil that a 
lot of people made excuses for, and it was “go along and get along.” In 1984, I believe it was, we 
just started to look at this. How can a free labor movement really work side-by-side with 
something like apartheid? 
And, again, the American Labor Movement did not step up to the challenge in front of it. 
So, we took on the battle of sensitizing the country to the evils of apartheid. President Reagan, I 
believe, was in office at that time. And we set out with a specific goal to undo it, or disengage 
U.S. policy from Africa in general, well, South Africa, specifically. Under the leadership of 
Randall Robinson, we helped form what is called TransAfrica, and it was specifically a body to 
put black thought into foreign policy. 
In ’84, we took on the role of trying to form something that would spread this discussion 
and debate nationwide, so we formed the Free South Africa Movement out of a number of other 
movements. And it took a while, but we finally got there. Mr. Mandela was ultimately released 
from prison, ultimately became president of South Africa, and now is gravely ill. But we have 
seen Africa in general and South Africa particularly move from, you know, colonial domination 
to independent democracies in many cases. 
EC: Why did you think it was important to bring Mr. Mandela here? 
WL: I think on his tour of 1990, it had two purposes: one, to give him an opportunity to 
define and project what he sees [1:15:00] for South Africa, what he saw for South Africa, in 
terms of a nonracial society, and secondly, let’s just let the country see someone who had spent 
27 years in prison for expressing that thought in South Africa. And it was such an incredible

impact on the country as a whole. I think a lot of minds were changed. A lot of people were 
educated. A lot of people became much more knowledgeable about the fact that there ought to be 
engagement in foreign policy. I mean, we’ve been allied with South Africa since the apartheid 
inception and never complained about it once. And whether it was Reagan or any others who 
preceded him, both Republicans and Democrats alike, we found a rationale for continuing to 
relate to an evil system. 
JB: Can I ask [clears throat] about, and if you think it’s irrelevant, you don’t have to 
answer, but after the apartheid was abolished in South Africa, there was a period of Truth and 
Reconciliation. 
WL: Right. 
JB: Do you think America needs such an acknowledgement of—? 
WL: Oh, I don’t think there’s any question. There’s lots of issues that could be put before 
a truth commission to have folks either admit their participation in it or argue for its larger 
existence, I mean, if they can make that argument. I mean, you’ve got just ongoing tragedies that 
grow out of our, you know, history and our systems across the South. I mean, we profess the 
need for democracy around the world, yet we sit quietly by while folks are denied the right to 
vote, or we rationalize the reason why they shouldn’t vote. As opposed to South Africa, who—or 
Brazil, where it’s mandatory that you vote. I mean, I think, if we want to really test our system, 
let’s make voting mandatory. And you would see the divisions that exist in the country, with 
regards to who should participate in democracy. 
And I think some of the past ills and racisms that exist not just in the South, but in the 
North, as well, or across the country, could really bear some airing out and have people simply 
share their views. I mean, it really goes back to what W. E. B. Du Bois said, “The problem of our

country is race.” I mean, we’re debating now, you know, comprehensive immigration reform. I 
mean, [laughs] who was here first? I mean, [laughs] everybody is an immigrant of some type, 
and we’re still debating those kinds of questions. 
EC: Mr. Lucy, I want to respect your time, so I know we all have many more questions, 
but thank you very much for meeting with us today. We appreciate it. 
WL: Well, thank you. 
JB: Elaine wants to take a photograph.
