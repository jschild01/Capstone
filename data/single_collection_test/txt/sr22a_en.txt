[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.400] gray cool brick and lumber cordwood stone and eyes.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.400] Yes all that was needed we both did do pal.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.400] This time of our lives we had on the canow.

[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.400] The plank is cold on me, are off on our way.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.400] Yes all kinds of people I meet now and then but I am no angel yet with the
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400] amen.

[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.400] They rob my poor pockets all silver and gold.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.400] I play for and they go like play for a dime.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400] I won't owe them money and mix it with mine.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.400] I gamble in Cleveland, enforcement the same, but gambling don't pay for you,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400] lose it again.

[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.400] But nobody cares, nobody's business how ragged I go.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.400] I eat when I'm hungry and drink when my dry.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.400] If nobody kills me I'll lift a lie die.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.400] My bed is not feathers of cotton, no no.

[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.400] You're an old upnoskipper, you clover and wild.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400] This frit de young dams all said you'd be the smile.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.400] I never will leave you, I'll never complain.

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400] And put things in order as some of our own.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400] I like a gay time but I love just one girl.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400] She's a pride of my heart and that the role can now.
