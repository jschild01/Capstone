[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Oh, since the day that thy work borne,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000] the foe may me shiver,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000] and often made me so full,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000] lorn down by the river side.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000] We land this war down by the river.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000] We land this war down by the river side.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000] The devil long he had me fast down by the river.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000] The Lord feed me as there he fast down by the river side.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000] He then said, come and follow me,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000] and thus never, like the darkness can't agree.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000] So in me ever, by, we land this war down by the river.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000] We land this war down by the river side.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000] This old world is a battlefield.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000] You need not fear or quiver.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000] Victus on our side, I found down by the river side.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000] Our captain, he is brave and strong.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000] We leave us never.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000] Off the sing the victus,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000] on down by the river side.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000] We land this war down by the river.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000] We land this war down by the river side.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000] We land this war down by the river side.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000] The devil is an old town.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000] Time where I met and learned and can tuck it down on the higher river.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000] When we use to down on their boats, it's color 10 meetings.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000] They used to have good times with old and mediums.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000] You used to learn many and buy a heart.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000] So I have the gist of the song in these verses.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000] Most is theirs.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000] My old black heart has been washed twice.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000] And all my darkness turned to light.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000] So keep those gays a jar.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000] I glory here, this great indeed.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000] For all the world, it's super steep.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000] So keep those gays a jar.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000] Keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000] Keep those gays a jar.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000] For I'm going to a place where I've seen my Savior's face.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000] When I write up in the resurrection card.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000] Others may do just as they will.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000] But keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000] For I am climbing Zion's hill.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000] So keep those gays a jar.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000] There I shall see my Savior's friend.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000] With him return at the expense.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000] So keep those gays a jar.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000] The way is playing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000] The Bible's true.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000] Or better rules.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000] And you'll get through.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000] So keep those gays a jar.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000] Keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000] Keep those gays a jar.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000] For I'm going to a place where I've seen my Savior's face.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000] When I write up in the resurrection card.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000] You may have the world with all it shows.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000] So keep those golden gays wide open.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000] Keep those gays a jar.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000] For I'm going to a place where I've seen my Savior's face.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000] When I write up in the resurrection card.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000] Tell me the story of that song, Captain.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000] This is another one that came in contact with Don Haryr and the Kentucky side.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000] Somebody.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000] Somebody.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000] Well, it was a quartet but it was very nice.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000] We all loved it.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000] I learned as much of it as possible.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:34.760] These songs on this record were sung at Akron O'Haw on Sunday June 27, 1937 by Captain Pearl
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:47.760] Arnye to whom we were introduced by Mrs. Helen Waterhouse of the Beacon Journal in Akron O'Haw.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.760] The songs have been sung for the youth and benefit of the library of Congress in Washington.
