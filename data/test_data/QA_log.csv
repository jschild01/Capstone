New York. 

Dear Mr. Engel:

On your request I saw yesterday the Fairchild people, with
reference to sound reproduction machines to be used in recording folk-songs, 
and for my purposes to be used where there are no possible electric connec-
tions. In other worlds, the machine must be operated by batteries. Such a 
machine the Fairchilds offered to build within three weeks time at a cost of 
$475. It will weigh about 300 lbs. Should they also build a platform for 
carrying the machine in the back of an automobile, the total cost would be
$500. The Fairchilds furnished a machine of this type to Prof. De Onise of
Columbia University, and Prof. Schindler of Bennington College, for recording 
folk-songs in Spain. Mr. Garwick claims that 200 successful recordings were 
made. 

I visited the Amplion people this morning. They asked me
$495 for a similar machine complete, the chief difference being that their 
machine weights less than 100 lbs. The Amplion people inform me that Dr. 
Greet of the English Department of Columbia University has in use an outfit
purchased from them that has given entire satisfaction. They also claim
that New York University has recently purchased a machine. 

Both of these companies gave me satisfactory evidence that 
their machines operate successfully, both in recording and reproducing
singing, when such a recording is done under the favorable conditions of 
their own equipment and expert operation. I did not have an opportunity 
of hearing any records played that had been made under field conditions. 

I am deeply grateful for your very kind interest in my work 
and the constant courtesy you have shown me. 

Sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax  [?]

P.S. For your information, a letter addressed to me in care of General
Delivery, Albany, New York, will reach me any time for a week. After that, 
I shall be at the University of Texas, Austin, Texas. 

P.P.S. Prof. De Onise tells me the machine was entirely satisfactory.

Dear Mr. Garwick:

       I very much appreciate your two letters,
describing in detail the new recording machine which 
you propose to sell to Mr. Engel for me to use. I 
am writing to Mr. Engel. Of course, I hope to have
the very best machine available; but my chance to 
secure your machine must come through him. I can not,
myself, afford the expense.

         I, too, hope that we can get together
some time soon so that you can make a record of a
couple of my cowboy songs, along with the yodels.
      I hope you will let me hear from you again.

SOUND RECORDING INSTRUMENTS
RYE, NEW YORK

November 3, 1934

Mr. John A. Lomax,
General Delivery,
Atmore, Ala.

Your trouble is caused by recording at a slower speed than when the records are played back. Very likely it is caused by a slipping of the idler wheel under the lighter load of playing back, it is not slipping as much as when the recording is done. It could also be caused by a badly written idler wheel, but this is not probable. The trouble may however be that the motor bracket has slipped out of adjustment and you will find a casting that holds the motor shaft in adjustment against the idler wheel. Release the screws and move the motor toward the left (toward the idler wheel) this casting is slotted to permit this. If you move it too far it will be too tight, so it will be necessary for you to make the correctly, it is not a difficult job. You will have it correctly adjusted if the turntable does not lose speed under the pressure of your finger, this is about twice that of the cutting load. At the time I shipped this instrument to you, I sent along a little swinging gate that was to be used for obtaining the correct speed which is 78 R.P.M. This was adjusted to 78 R.P.M. under cutting load, but it was only approximately correct as the turntable travels about 79 R.P.M. when not under cutting load. If you will send this back to me I will adjust it so that the points will be a compensation for this extra revolution. It is quite important that your turntable revolves at 78 R.P.M. This is the standard speed. Several extra R.P.M. will change the pitch of the voice or music to quite a noticeable extent.

We heard from the Postmaster at Arkansas and they deny receipt of the packages. We are putting in a claim for them I feel sure that these packages were sent to Austin, as I immediately worte to them to send it on with the postage guaranteed. We sent you 25 discos 12 inch to you at Atmore, Ala. The needles are enclosed in the letter to Atmore. Your writing is not entirely clear, but we believe that it is Atmore, Ala. We are sending a copy of this letter to you at Montgomery and one to Atmore. To avoid error in the future won't you please print the shipping address.

Your professor is wrong about the pickup. It is not a cheap one. It is as good as any magnatic one on the market. It is rubber damped however, but it is possible that the rubber has become hardened or some of the internal parts have been damaged. I am now using a crystal pickup which is much lighter in weight at the needle head. It is getting much more out of the records. Riding lighter makes less surface noise and the needles last much longer. It means making a change in the amplifier, and I will have to look at the wiring diagram to see what changes are needed. I will let you know the cost of making this change. I think however when you get the

made up to this time."" There are, as I understand it, nearly one
hundred double-faced records. There would seem to be nothing to prevent
our copying them for the Library if we can find some way of meeting the

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very sorry that my delay in answering your letter should have
caused you any anxiety. As you know, any order for crating and shipping
must go through several departments thereby causing a delay. The machine
has been crated and is being shipped to you today, express prepaid. It
should be in Texas in a few days.

We sent Dr. Miller the requested information in August. He should 
have received it long ago. In case the list went astray, will you please
notify us so that we may send him a copy.

Regarding the song ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" the earliest edition
seems to be the first one listed below*. There seems to be some 
confusion as to the composer, as can be seen by comparing the cover title
and caption title of the second one on the list. Furthermore, Edward B.
Marks, in his book, ""They All Sang"" (New York, 1934, p. 232), refers to 
the song as an English one by ""Lee"" but gives no date. The year 1868, 
however, seems to be the year in which the song was first published.

students will not have the opportunity to make use of this collection
which you have. In order that the utmost benefit may be derived
from this collection, copies of the recordings should be placed
in governmental depositories as soon as possible. We are
ready to communicate with Senator Hatton W. Summers at any time
regarding an appropriation for such a measure, if it would be of
any value toward getting such a system of depositories established.

played on a washboard hung around the neck.  A different
thing from the Cajun orchestra which of course is generally
a fiddle in the lee, lead, with an accordian accompanyment.
That's typically European just as the, as the wind with
percussion in a hot relationship is the African one.  And
we, you know, here we can get the two kinds of music in if
you, you know.
     So we come to a, the beginning of our story
which is the fact that when the Cajuns moved into the
praries they had black neighbors.  There were slaves early
of course, and some of them owned slaves.  There were three
people of color who had big plants, who owned big ranches,
too.  And in this log of, of the brands of the Cajun country
some of the names alongside of these brands were names of
black creoles and Cajuns who had cattle ranches.
     They lived in this strange kind of southern
Louisiana relationship where they both went to the same
church and, and worshiped side by side.  There was  a code
noir which regulated the severity of punishment for black
slaves.  And there were conditions by means of which a
person could work himself out of slavery.  There were many
marriages between the two, much mixing of blood.
     And then suddenly the Civil War came --
changed everything because the Cajuns didn't feel they had
very much stake in this, in this, in the southern side.
