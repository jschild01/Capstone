    Collection of 1747 digital files of

            by Markham Starr and four of his published monographs. The collection primarily
            documents northeastern fishermen and the fishing industry. Some records also document
            farming and dairy production. A majority of the works are part of larger themed
            documentary projects, and others are independent works.

    The collection was acquired from Starr in five separate accruals, 2013-2020. The film in
            Series 2 ('Scalloping on the Mister G') was originally received as a DVD and Starr
            delivered a replacement digital file to the archive in February 2021.

    Processing History
   </head>
   <p>
    The Markham Starr collection was minimally processed by Charles Hosale between November
            2020 and February 2021. Prior to that, Bert Lyons processed afc2013031_dc001 (series 1,
            the 2013 accession) in 2013. Julia Kim modified filenames in afc2013031_dc004 (series 4,
            the 2019 accrual) at the time of acquisition. In general, the other files have not been
            arranged or renamed. Charles Hosale retroactively assigned AFC "dc" ID numbers in 2020.
            Prior to 2020 the individual accruals did not have unique identifiers. Some records that
            had been separated into the case file after acquisition were reintegrated into the
            collection by Charles Hosale in December 2020. The digital accruals were processed into
            individual archival information packages (AIPs) in March 2022. The paper monographs were
            minimally processed prior to 2020. See the series-level Scope and Content and
            Arrangement notes for more specific information concerning each record group.

    Biographical Note
   </head>
   <p>
    Markham Starr is a documentary photographer, writer, and filmmaker from Connecticut. He
            is active in the northeastern United States. His primary interests are fisherman and the
            fishing industry, and has also documented farming and dairy production, among other arts
            and trades. His particular focus is documenting industries and individuals experiencing
            change due to industrialization, technological advancements, globalization, or
            government regulation.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    Collection of 1747 digital files of graphic, moving image, sound recording, and
            manuscript format documentary works created by Markham Starr, and 4 of Starr's published
            monographs. The collection primarily documents northeastern United States fisherman and
            the fishing industry. Some records also document farming and dairy production. Starr
            created the records in the collection between 2005 and 2019. The works often focus on
            individuals and businesses experiencing change due to industrialization, technological
            advancements, globalization, or government regulation. Many of the moving image, sound
            recording, and manuscript works feature first-person narratives from interview subjects.
            The discussions concern their experience as workers and the ways their work has changed
            during their careers. Some of the records feature detailed discussions and
            demonstrations of technical processes and skilled techniques. The graphic materials
            depict individuals at work or in portrait,worksites, and trade tools, machinery, and
            implements. A majority of the works are associated with one of Starr's larger themed
            documentary projects, but the sound recordings and some of the moving images are
            independent works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Starr selected works from his projects to donate to the American Folklife Center.
            Besides those that stand alone, the records are drawn from six themed documentary
            projects. The names of the projects and the years they were conducted are:

    These projects resulted in published books, which are titled with the same names.
            Digital drafts or final publications of the books are included in this collection's
            manuscript materials. Additionally, some of the titles have physical printed copies also
            included in the collection (series 6). Starr's descriptions of these projects can be
            found in the manuscripts, especially the books.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bulk of the collection is graphic materials and moving images. The graphic materials
            are all associated with one of the six documentary projects and are grouped by project.
            The moving images are roughly divided into two equal groupings: those that are part of
    <title>
     <part>
      In History's Wake: The Last Trap Fishermen of RI
     </part>
    </title>
    , and those that are independent works. All but one of the moving images
            concerns fishing and fishermen - the outlier is about a Preston, Connecticut farmer and
            his family dairy farm. Most of the fishing films, including the independent works, are
            shot in Rhode Island and concern the region's fish industry. The films vary in length
            from short to feature length. The sound recordings are interviews with Rhode Island trap
            fishermen; however Starr indicates that these recordings were conducted separately from
            his
    <title>

     </part>
    </title>
    project.
   </p>
   <p>
    Starr's manuscripts are either associated with a documentary project or are descriptive
            aids for the collection. The descriptive aids are spreadsheets and text documents and
            contain item level information for each file. Archivists repurposed, with very minimal
            edits, much of Starr's guides into the titles and item-level Scope and Content notes in
            this finding aid. The guides contain some additional information such as locations and
            camera equipment used. The descriptive documents in each series are:

      Accrual is 824 images, 2 corresponding spreadsheets, 2 book pdfs, and 1
                  manuscript. The files concern two of Starr's documentary projects:
      <title>

        End of the Line: Closing the Last Sardine Cannery in America
       </part>

       <part>
        Finest Kind: The Lobstermen of Corea Maine
       </part>
      </title>
      . The photos are from two documentary trips; the Lobstermen photos are
                  from June and July 2010 and the Cannery photos are from March 2010, primarily the
                  29th and 30th. See the Biographical Note for further descriptions of the projects.
                  The photos generally depict subjects at work, tools and implements, and worksites.
                  Every photo has an item level description, which are saved with the photos in two
                  spreadsheets - see this series' Arrangement Note for more information. The PDF
                  'Finest Kind The Lobstermen of Corea Maine.pdf' is a copy of Starr's book by the
                  same name. In addition to copies of the photographs, it contains transcribed
                  interviews with a dozen fisherman and their families, extensive information about
                  the lobster fishing trade and industry, and descriptions of Starr's project. The
                  PDF 'The Last Sardine The Closing of the Stinson Cannery.pdf' only contains copies
                  of Starr's photographs. The word document 'afc2013031_ms01.docx' is Starr's
                  description of the Cannery documentary project.

      Starr assigned unique IDs to the images in this accrual. The unique ids are a
                  sequential number starting from zero. The file
                  'manifest_ph0001-ph0336_inventory.xls' contains the Starr's descriptions for the

      project photos, and 'manifest_ph0337-ph0824_inventory.xls' contains his

      <title>
       <part>
        Lobsterman
       </part>
      </title>
      photos. The unique IDs match the descriptions to filenames. Dates, when
                  provided in the spreadsheets, appear to be inaccurate. The images' Exif metadata
                  appears to have more reliable date information. The files are all in one
                  folder.

      The accrual was initially processed by Bert Lyons in 2013. During processing,
                  American Folklife Center staff prepended "afc2013031_ph" to the photo filenames
                  and renamed the digital manuscript. Charles Hosale added the PDF files to the
                  folder in November 2020. The PDFs had previously been stored separately.

       The digital files on disk have not been rearranged from their original order.
                     The manuscript files have been described in alphabetical order in the finding
                     aid and the photographs are listed in numerical order by ID number. The
                     photographs' titles and ID numbers are copied from Starr's item level metadata
                     in the photo inventory "manifest_ph0001-ph0336_inventory.xls". The descriptions
                     are used as titles. If a description was too long to be an effective title
                     archivists shortened it and recorded the original description in the item's
                     Scope and Content note. The dates come from the photographs' EXIF metadata,
                     except where that data is clearly inaccurate. In those cases archivists
                     estimated an accurate date. See the inventory and files' metadata for more
                     context.

                        all fishing effort involves lobstering this far down east.

        Beach Cliff Sardine sign at entrance to Stinson's. Known as Big Jim, this
                        sign was once used to welcome people to Maine on the highway. Originally
                        made in wood, it was being taken down and Stinson brought it to Prospect
                        Harbor and it became the symbol on the Beech Cliff brand of sardines. The
                        sign was rebuilt in metal. His boots are over five feet tall.

        View of the facility looking from the wharf towards the mouth of the harbor.
                        The wharf is where fresh sardines were landed by boat. Sardine carriers
                        would tie up here and the fish was pumped from their holds. Stinson's
                        eventually took in frozen fish as well by truck to extend their processing
                        schedule. On the left is where overboard discharged was screened out through
                        roto-strainers. The bait area is just a little bit to the right - cuttings
                        and whole bait for lobstermen.

        Frozen blocks of herring - 40 or 50 lb. blocks when fresh fish couldn't be
                        had. Last 3 months of production were frozen. Frozen fish made scheduling
                        easier -they knew how long the day would be. The problem was the amount of
                        fish they could thaw and produce each day was less than they could do with
                        fresh fish. Early years they processed fish from the spring to late fall as
                        fish were caught along coast. In 1960's they went into purse-seining, in
                        deeper waters, and that allowed them to get more fish for the winter time,
                        so they started producing in the winter as well. 1980's-90's pair-trawling
                        allowed them to fish in even deeper water and rougher weather. Purse-seining
                        you had a small boat that had to encircle the fish which couldn't be done in
                        rough weather. When the quotas began in the 2000 era, reductions occurred in
                        the amount of fish that could be caught, so they got frozen fish to
                        supplement their catch. Fish were then caught in November and December when
                        the fish were clean and in good shape, and they would freeze the amount they
                        needed for April, May and even into June. That allowed Stinson's to produce
                        year-round. The fish were brought in and frozen on shore. The bulk of the
                        frozen fish came from New Jersey, and some from New Bedford. Stinson's
                        didn't have their own freezers.

        Tank room. They would offload anywhere from 40,000-50,000 pounds from a
                        truck or as much as 120,000 -140,000 pounds of fish from a boat. They could
                        hold those fish overnight in refrigerated brine. It was an ammonia system
                        used to cool the brine tank - temperatures maintained below 40 degrees -
                        this would preserve them overnight so the enzymes wouldn't ruin the fish.
                        Each tank on the left side of the photo would hold about 10,000 pounds of
                        fish and there were 11 of those tanks. On the right side they were smaller
                        tanks and would hold about 8000 pounds of fish, and there were eight tanks
                        there.

        This man flumed the fish out of the tanks and into separators. All the fish
                        had to be separated by size prior to cutting so there was a uniform size
                        going to the cutting machines. The thickness of the fish would determine the
                        length of the fish as well. The fish were sent down a series of parallel
                        rollers spaced at various distances apart from one another. The smallest
                        fish would fall through the rollers first and onto a conveyor belt that
                        would take them away. As the distance between rollers increased, larger fish
                        would fall through to their own conveyor by size. Water sprayed on the fish
                        in these images keeps the fish lubricated and separated from each other to
                        aid the sorting process.

        PVC piping that brought fresh fish from trucks or boats into the tanks along

                        would be flumed down to these tanks via these pipes. Trucks would offload
                        onto a conveyor, boats directly into pipework. The "Ts" in the photo could
                        be raised or lowered to fill any particular tank. When the tank was full,
                        the T was raised and the fish went to the next tank. These pipes also added
                        water to fill the tanks more quickly.

                        would hold about 2400 -3000 pounds of frozen blocks of fish. Forklift lifts

        Separator. If more than two different sizes of fish, the third size fish
                        would go to a different conveyor that would put those fish into three
                        holding tanks, and if those tanks filled with that size fish, they would cut
                        those, allowing them to have at least three sizes of fish. That would make
                        it easier for the cutting machines to cut them, as they need to be pretty
                        uniform in size. Sometimes they'd end up with four different sizes, making
                        it more difficult.

        Automatic cutting machines on the cutting line. There are six cutting
                        machines - three set for one size and three set for the next size up. They
                        would cut as many as 200-250 fish a minute, cutting both the sardine and the
                        steak at the same time - same set of blades. They'd go from the cutting
                        machine to the fish totes by flume. The cutting machine was invented in the
                        1970's. Dick Trenholm invented fish-steaks. At first they were hand-cut. The
                        fish was put onto a set of blades and you'd lift a lever up to cut the fish.
                        It was very slow, but it utilized all of the fish. Eventually they added a
                        conveyor belt and a moving set of blades to cut the fish and speed the
                        process. Eventually they added hand-feeders to the machines. That was done
                        when Connors Brothers took over. Back in 1986 they closed the South West
                        Harbor plant and that's when they automated Prospect Harbor. They put in
                        what they call Trio machines that would cut the small fish - 5.5 to 7" fish
                        - it would cut those as just sardines only. They also had bigger machines
                        that would cut the fish entirely into fish steaks. Then they invented these
                        machines that could do both. The old McPhearson machines just cut just
                        steaks. They stopped using scissors in 1987, although they still brought in
                        frozen blocks of sprats to supplement the production that would have to be
                        thawed and cut by hand. They were very small - 8 to ten fish per can - 5.5"
                        to 7" fish, so they were cut by hand, but they still used the automated
                        packing line to pack them. It was costly, but a higher priced product in the
                        end. When Connors Brothers took over in 2000 they did away with the sprats
                        and so it was all automated after that. When cutting all with scissors - 100
                        to 120 packers on the line for the same production with 20 today on the
                        automated line. The packers were going away anyway - a dying breed. 125
                        packers could do a 1000 cases in a day. They were able to do 3000 cases in a
                        day with the automated line, assuming no breakdowns and good fish flow. 100
                        cans per case.

        Fish waste that would go into lobster bait. If not suitable for bait it
                        would go a local plant to be turned into fishmeal. The cutting room could
                        cut a few hundred thousand pounds a day during the busy season - about five
                        truckloads. That would produce over 3 thousand cases. If they couldn't all
                        be packed during that day, they were iced and held overnight in the totes. A
                        lot of times they would cut for two hours after they got done packing to
                        build a buffer for the next day, which would allow them to start an hour
                        earlier. The packers could out-pack the cutting machines.

        Cans coming down onto the packing line from above. There were ten lanes,
                        five on each side of the line. There were two packers to a station - ten
                        packers on each side. Packers had everything in front of them - fish and
                        cans flowing continuously by. The noise level in this room was quite high
                        with thousands of aluminum cans banging together, so all workers throughout
                        the factory wore ear-plugs. The packers decided who was going to put which
                        fish in the can. Sometimes the first packer put in two fish and the second
                        packer put one, or they would switch. Some packers would pack every other
                        can. They had their routines. They had to work well with each other as a
                        team - you couldn't put a fast and a slow packer together. Two fast packers
                        or two slow packers would work together. It took three or four years once
                        the automated line came in to get the right combination of packers, as they
                        also had to like working together. If they were arguing, they weren't
                        putting fish in cans and they weren't getting paid. Everything was
                        piece-work. They got paid for every hundred cans that they packed. The price
                        depended on the size of the fish. With three fish in a can, they would get
                        73 cents. 8 fish to a can they could get up to a $1.26, $1.30 per case.
                        Steaks were the same way $2.46 - $2.60 per case.

        Bossy Carts - bottom of cart could be elevated so cans didn't fall far and
                        dent. Penny Beal could lower floor of cart as they filled. Each cart held
                        3000 cans. Six carts per retort, or 18,000 cans. The cart was wheeled up to
                        the retort and a cog on a conveyor in the retort would catch the cart and
                        take it off its chassis, keeping the wheels and dirt out of the retort. The
                        old style retorts were vertical - held 1700 gallons of cushion water, and
                        cans would go into them, and they'd lower the water as it filled with cans.
                        They held 18,000 cans as well, but used 1700 gallons of water. When they
                        cooled those retorts, they also used 1000-1500 gallons of water to cool the
                        cans. Additionally, on the bottom of the retort, you had a lot of pressure
                        on the cans with 16000 cans above them. These modern horizontal retorts only
                        have 3000 cans in each cart and only used 150 gallons of water, saving a lot
                        of water per batch. They were using as much as 75-80,000 gallons of water a
                        day, and that was cut down to about 25-30,000 with these new retorts.

        Shows water spray in retort. Retort is a pressure cooker that sterilizes the
                        product. Cans are hermetically sealed and still have bacteria in them.
                        Operates at 240 degrees for 50 minutes. With a sauce, 252 degrees at
                        fifty-five minutes. The higher temperatures would discolor the tomato and
                        mustard sauces. Pressure kept the cans from exploding.

        Vision room- inspected the cans at 350 cans a minute on all sides and top
                        for defects. Anything out of spec was kicked out pneumatically as the can
                        exited the room. A person would then visually inspect to verify the problem.
                        If the cans were ok, they were put back on the line. If not, they were

                        cans were stacked 12 high on a conveyor belt, long enough to do two rows at
                        a time on a box. So once the cans were stacked 12 high, it would push the 24
                        cans into a box that was pre- glued and up-righted. The case would then
                        slide down and the top would be glued and stacked on a pallet.

        Model of Ida Mae - sardine carrier owned by Stinson's for years. At one
                        point she was turned into a mussel dragger. Also used it to carry shrimp one
                        year when they did shrimp. Eventually turned back into a sardine carrier -
                        it is still in operation as of 1/2011. In the 60's-70's the fish were
                        salted. After that, the government required them to be iced - most people
                        preferred the salted, as the quality seemed better. She could carry around
                        81 hogshead - 1225 lbs. to a hogshead - she was a small carrier.

       Files, primarily photographs, created during Starr's project. Also included is
                     one inventory spreadsheet containing descriptive data for every photo and a
                     digital copy of Starr's book 'Finest Kind The Lobstermen of Corea Maine.pdf'.
                     In addition to copies of the photographs, the book contains transcribed
                     interviews with a dozen fisherman and their families, extensive information
                     about the lobster fishing trade and industry, and Starr's descriptions of the
                     documentary project.

       The digital files on disk have not been rearranged from their original order.
                     The manuscript files have been described in alphabetical order in the finding
                     aid and the photographs are listed in numerical order by ID number. The
                     photographs' titles and ID numbers are copied from Starr's item level metadata
                     in his descriptive spreadsheet "manifest_ph0337-ph0824_inventory.xls". The
                     descriptions and listings of individuals in the photos are used as titles. If a
                     description was too long to be an effective title archivists shortened it and
                     recorded the original description in the item's Scope and Content note. The
                     dates come from the photographs' EXIF metadata, except where that data is
                     clearly inaccurate. In those cases archivists estimated an accurate date. See
                     the inventory and files' metadata for more context.

        Virgo heads up into Gouldsboro Bay. Just above Corea's harbor, this bay is
                        nearly 7 miles deep and nearly all of the Corea fishermen set traps in the
                        bay (note the number of buoys in the photo - the whole bay is covered with
                        them) although most of the fishermen also fish out in the open ocean,
                        depending on the movement of the lobsters. Lobsters travel on or offshore
                        depending on water temperatures. Doubles, primarily, are fished in the bay,
                        along with singles, due to the crowded conditions. Longer trawls, of
                        anywhere from 5 to 30 traps are fished offshore to save time where
                        entanglements are less likely.

        Two lobstermen load bait for the next day's fishing. Herring is the
                        preferred bait in Corea, but alewives are used when they run upstream in

        Lobstermen's wharfs are used to store gear and as a place from which to load
                        their vessels with equipment. They can also tie their vessels to the piers
                        and wait for low tide to inspect the bottoms of their boats or make repairs.
                        The shacks on the dock originally were used in the winters as workshops,
                        where they could make wooden traps and buoys (no longer used anywhere) or
                        maintain other gear. Lobstermen now mostly work on gear in other locations.
                        Note the lobster car in the foreground loaded with spare traps. As not all
                        fishermen have wharfs, sometimes gear is stored on the water. Cars are used
                        to store lobsters until needed for sale - floating crates that can double as
                        docks.

        Tools of the trade. A lobster gauge on top measures both the short and long
                        legal limits. At the time of the photos, lobsters had to measure at least
                        3.25" and no longer than 5." along the carapace. The device on the bottom is
                        a bander - used to stretch the rubber bands around the claws of lobsters
                        they were going to keep - this protected the fishermen from claws while also
                        keeping the lobsters from tearing each other apart. Both tools are made from
                        stainless steel.

        Boat at the Coop dock unloading lobsters. Kevin on the left weighs lobsters
                        from the boat and will make out a slip with the final number of pounds
                        landed. Bruce Hartford on the boat has another tote of lobsters to land. The
                        traps on the boat were picked up during the day and will be moved to another
                        location ahead of the lobster's migration. Docks are actually lobster cars

        Babe Crowley grabs a buoy with a boothook. The boat runs up on a buoy so
                        that the captain can grab the buoys and then feed the line through the block
                        and into the pot hauler. Sea urchins line the deck and rails. Unwanted
                        guests, the urchins can fully pack the trap and keep lobsters out. They are
                        sometimes crushed or simply dumped back overboard, and cost much time and
                        effort. There is a winter business in sea urchin harvesting in Corea. Divers
                        collect the urchins and they are sent to Japan for consumption.

        A "berried" female lobster. Tens of thousands of lobster eggs are glued to
                        the tail of this female. Egg bearing females are thrown back overboard, as
                        they represent the future of fishing. They can also be v-notched. A v-cut
                        notch in the tail marks the bearing female even if she has no eggs, and no
                        lobster with a v-notch can be landed. This has assured a continuing crop of
                        lobsters for Maine fishermen.

        Leigh Farnsworth unloading her catch at the coop. At the time of these
                        photos, she was one of two women captains in the harbor. There were many
                        women working as sternmen (they prefer to be called sternmen rather than
                        sternwomen, fishermen over fisherwoman). Mostly they avoid the semantic
                        gender problem by saying they fish or they stern on a lobster boat. Corea
                        has a long history of women in the industry - wives often helped husbands on
                        their boats in the past. Today, there are many husband/wife teams working
                        from the harbor.

        Thai Baby returns home from an offshore trip. Bob Anderson, who owns the
                        boat, named it in honor of his Thai wife. He prefers to fish way off-shore
                        and so leaves very early and returns very late in the day.

        Five boats from Corea work traps outside of the harbor on a bright day. Most
                        fishermen from the port have traps in Gouldsboro Bay as well as in waters
                        offshore. Some travel up to 25 mile offshore to set traps throughout the
                        year.

        Foam buoys. Many of the elder fishermen talked of the days when they carved
                        their buoys from cedar trees. The wooden buoys would have to be swapped out
                        during the summer as they became waterlogged. Buoys are painted with the
                        official colors assigned to each lobsterman, and one example of their buoy
                        is prominently displayed on their vessel.

        Christine A hauled and placed next to owner's garage. Corea's fleet is
                        hauled for winter by a hydraulic trailer and the boats are often stored for
                        a few months in the owner's yard. In some cases, when the owner has died,
                        the boat is hauled and brought home in the summer. There are a handful of
                        boats in the harbor that fish all winter and are not hauled at all.

        Bruce Crowley works to untangle two sets of trawls. Given the crowded
                        condition of the bay, lobstermen occasionally need to disengage their gear
                        from those of another. It seems almost possible to walk across the bay on
                        buoys alone. Despite the feeling that no lobsters could ever leave the bay
                        their own, the yearly catch for lobsters along the Maine coast has risen
                        each year to a new record.

        Gulls swarm after bait discarded from the traps just hauled. Contrary to
                        popular belief, fresh bait is preferred to rotten and each trap receives new

        Dan Whitaker hangs a bait bag inside a trap. The bait is stuffed into these
                        bags by the sternman, and the bags are hung in the trap to attract lobsters.
                        Bags were once made of cotton and needed frequent replacing as they rotted
                        fairly quickly. Today they are made of synthetic fibers and last a long
                        time. Dan Whitaker - first generation lobsterman.

        Dan Whitaker attaching whale-rope to a set of traps. Whale-rope is a
                        weighted rope that sinks to the ocean floor - an attempt to keep whales from
                        becoming entangled in the warps. It is now mandatory out beyond an imaginary
                        line set by the government along the coast. Besides the added expense, the
                        lines now chafe along the rocky bottom and fishermen lose their traps,
                        causing many of them to give up their offshore sites.

        Fish ladder to the pond on the Guzzle Road. In the spring, a trap is set
                        here for alewives that head into the pond to spawn. Fishermen buy the rights
                        to the fish at a town auction each year - promising to pay so much per
                        bushel of fish. This bait is then sold to interested parties. This makes for
                        a cheaper bait - a major expense for lobstermen at this time in history.

        The Fundy Wanderer heads to sea for a day's work. This type of boat is known
                        as a Novie Boat - the high bow is typical of the boats built in Nova Scotia
                        to handle open seas. This high bow, while helpful in heavy seas, makes it
                        hard to see trap buoys in calm waters like those fished near Corea.

        An automatic pot hauler. Hydraulically operated, two spinning disks form a
                        "V" into which the pot warp is placed to haul the traps. This revolutionized
                        the industry, and allowed fishermen to haul the newer wire traps which have
                        no natural buoyance like the wooden traps did. It also allowed the fishermen
                        to work in deep waters and haul multiple traps at once, saving their backs
                        much effort.

                        Symonds and her partner when they first moved to the area. It sat on a

        Wharf on right and railway for hauling lobster cars on left. While there are
                        no railways that can haul boats in the harbor (all boats are hauled with a
                        hydraulic trailer from a launch ramp) there are the remains of several small
                        railways used to haul lobster cars - the floating boxes lobstermen use to
                        store live lobsters in. Free flow of water through the crates keep the
                        lobsters alive until sold. Cars also double as docks in the harbor.

        Upper Corea Harbor at dead low tide. Fishermen's shacks, wharves, and gear
                        still ring the harbor - very unusual even for Maine by this time. There was
                        only one non-fishing boat in the harbor at the time these photos were

        Old house on the way to Corea. At the time of these photos, the US economy
                        was in the tank and there were many abandoned homes in the area surrounding
                        Corea. Some were empty and for sale, many seemed to be abandoned.

        Very old fisherman's shack. Barely standing on the few piles left of the
                        wharf, this shack has lost its roof and won't last much longer. It is

        Boats waiting in the mouth of the harbor for a space to open on the docks at
                        the coop. The little boat Pot-of-Gold was towed in by the Fundy Wanderer
                        after developing engine problems. Fishermen from the harbor always helped
                        others that needed it, knowing their turn could soon come. One fisherman
                        remarked they only called the Coast Guard as a last resort.

        Early photograph of fishermen in Corea Harbor purse seining bait. When
                        schools of herring come into the small harbors, fishermen took advantage and
                        netted them for bait from these small boats. They would also "torch" them at
                        night - use a torch light to attract the fish and then scoop them up with
                        dip nets. Photograph is from an family album owned by Mrs. Morna Briggs. Her
                        husband was a lobsterman as is one of her sons. She also lobstered with her
                        husband as he got older. Photo of a photo.

      Accrual is 841 images, 4 corresponding spreadsheets, 4 book pdfs, and 1 moving
                  image. All the files except the moving image concern four of Starr's documentary

      </title>
      . The photos generally depict subjects at work, tools and implements, and
                  worksites. Every photo has an item level description, which are saved with the
                  photos in four spreadsheets - see this series' Arrangement note for more
                  information. In addition to copies of the photographs, the book PDFs all contain
                  descriptions of Starr's (and, in the case of

      . It is Starr's 2011 documentary narrated by Capt. Mike Marchetti, which
                  records a day in the life of three fishermen who day-scallop from the port of
                  Point Judith, RI.

      This accrual continues the image numbering from where DC_01 (the previous series)
                  ended, but the filenames have not had "afc2013031_ph" prepended. The filenames for
                  "Against the Tide" follow a different pattern than the others - the first four
                  digits are the unique ID and the following digits are the date the photograph was
                  taken. The donor's spreadsheets use unique IDs to associate his descriptions with
                  the files. The files are in four folders - each of the folders are named after the
                  project for which the images were created.

                  delivered a new born-digital copy from his personal files. The file in this

        Seamus &amp; Liam heads out carrying new traps for deployment. Fishermen
                        often bring traps back to port on each trip that require work or cleaning.
                        When traps become covered in growth they are heavier and less efficient.
                        They are usually steam cleaned and returned to work. This is a day boat -
                        lobstering near shore only, whereas Pt. Judith has many offshore
                        lobsterboats as well.

        Anthony Richards prepares to dump the scallop dredge aboard the Njord. The

                        dredge to dump its load on deck. This trip was outside of Long Island, and

                        bounces ineffectively along the bottom.

        Ellen Schomer and Kevin Tuttle sort fish on Rebecca Mary on a day trip
                        groundfishing in Block Island Sound. The trip was cut short after tearing
                        their net - the tear too big to repair at sea. This was one of Ellen's last
                        trips after 30 years at sea. At this time, she and one other woman were the
                        only women fishing steadily from the port. Nearly all trawlers were equipped
                        with a conveyor system used to sort fish at this time - saving many backs
                        and knees.

        Allan Glidden sorts fish on the deck of the Amelia Bucolo as Jim Main tends
                        the ship's winch. Trap fishing is a day fishery with a long history. Traps
                        had been set on the Rhode Island coast for hundreds of years, although when
                        this photo was taken, only four companies remained of the hundreds that once
                        worked the coastline.

        Bow art on Jessie James. A painter at Pro-Met Shipyard in Providence, RI,

        Jerry Babcock and Rodman Sykes sorting the catch on the Deborah Lee. This
                        trip was to catch skate to be used as lobster bait. The bait was sold to The
                        Bait Company on the Pt. Jude waterfront, who in turn sold it to local
                        lobstermen. Jerry Babcock and Rodman Sykes (left to right).

                        the deck. Fishing on offshore trips takes place around the clock, with the
                        net hauled back about every three hours. Once the fish have been dumped, the
                        net is reset and the vessel continues trawling while crew sort the catch.
                        Once the deck is cleared, fishermen head to their bunks to sleep until the
                        net is once again hauled. If in the fish, crew may not get a chance to leave
                        the deck at all.

        The Amelia Bucolo on a foggy morning at her trap site at Black Rock, just
                        east of Point Jude. She is piloted by her captain Jim Main, a career
                        fisherman. The Bucolo was specifically built as a carry boat for the trap
                        industry by the Mendonza family. Here, she waits for the longboats to get
                        into position on the trap before she ties up to the head end of the
                        "kitchen" portion of the trap.

        Bait barrels for lobstermen are covered to keep seagulls from pilfering.
                        Plastic barrels replaced wooden ones long ago. The smells in summer along
                        the lobster boat docks can be rather pungent. Tourists believe rotten bait
                        is best, but fishermen actually prefer the freshest bait they can get as it
                        will last longer in their traps. Pt. Jude lobstermen primarily use herring,
                        skate, and pogies, but any other fish will do in a pinch.

        The smaller, fiberglass trawler Slacker returns after a day of ground
                        fishing in Block Island Sound. Fiberglass is only useful up to a certain
                        size vessel in trawling, so few fiberglass trawlers exist in the fleet.
                        Their initial cost and maintenance costs are relatively low when compared to
                        steel. Most of the lobster fleet is made of fiberglass.

        Old School returning to port. One of the few wooden lobster boats still
                        working, she is termed a "Novi" boat, having been built in Nova Scotia.
                        These boats are known for their high bows, something that helps in northern
                        seas with large waves, but hinders lobstermen somewhat down here due to a
                        decrease in vision as lobstermen approach a particular lobster buoy.

                        Company on the Pt. Jude waterfront, who in turn sold it to local lobstermen.
                        Jerry and Rodman Sykes, the owner and captain, have fished together for more
                        than 25 years - very unusual on any vessel.

        Mermaid painting on the bow of the Suzanne Beth. Most vessels, during the
                        hey-day of fishing out of Point Jude, had bow art, but given the economic
                        conditions by this time most had been painted over. There was one man at
                        Pro-Met shipyard in Providence who prided himself on creating this artwork.
                        This artwork disappeared when the vessel was sold, the new owner thinking it
                        highly inappropriate. This vessel was a hybrid design - built like an
                        Eastern rig with the high bow and working deck in the center of the vessel,
                        but with a stern reel aft. After hauling, the full net was dragged forward
                        to the center of the vessel for sorting - an attempt to keep the fishermen
                        protected from heavy weather. Unfortunately, on the first voyage, a young
                        crewmember was accidentally wound up in the net and killed, and fishermen
                        never really liked the vessel after that. As an experiment, it never really
                        seemed to work. She was later sold to New Bedford and converted to
                        scalloping.

        Ellen Schomer on the Rebecca Mary on a day trip groundfishing in Block

                        big to repair at sea. This was one of Ellen's last trips after 30 years at
                        sea. Only a few women fished commercially out of the Point at this time.

        The Suzanne Beth. This vessel was a hybrid design - built like an Eastern
                        rig with the high bow and working deck in the center of the vessel, but with
                        a stern reel aft. After hauling, the full net was dragged forward to the
                        center of the vessel for sorting - an attempt to keep the fishermen
                        protected from heavy weather. Unfortunately, on the first voyage, a young
                        crewman was accidentally wound up in the net and killed, and fishermen never
                        really liked the vessel after that. As an experiment in new vessel design,
                        it never really seemed to work. She was later sold to New Bedford and
                        converted to scalloping.

        Two fishermen watch as the net comes aboard the Mikhaela Louise on a squid
                        trip to Georges Bank in very heavy weather. This first haul-back took more
                        than 40 minutes to land given the weather and the fact it was so packed with
                        fish. Normally, it takes a few minutes to bring the cod end on deck.

        The Grandville Davis returns to her dock after a day's fishing outside of
                        Block Island. She is a strip built boat - very unusual. She was built for
                        and owned by Chris Brown, and was cut up about 5 years after this photo was
                        taken. Another wooden trawler, the Mabel Susan, is docked to the left.

        Bow art on trawler Lightning Bay. A painter at Pro-Met Shipyard in
                        Providence, RI, prided himself on his bow art paintings, and at one point in
                        time, many of the vessels in the fleet sported his work. As times got
                        tougher, these whimsical paintings often disappeared.

        A pilot whale breaks the surface on Georges Bank. These whale listen for the
                        sound of trawlers starting to haul back and then swim over to enjoy a feast.
                        They often swim between the vessel and the net coming towards the ship, but
                        never get caught up in the gear. Once fishermen start sorting, fish to be
                        discarded go back overboard down a chute, and these whales simply follow the
                        vessel eating everything that comes off. Once sorting is done, they
                        disappear, only to be seen again at the next haul back.

        Mike Marchetti empties a lobster trap aboard the Captain Robert. Mike owns
                        the Mister G as well, with which he trawls or scallops, among other things.
                        Mike does whatever he can to make money fishing - including pot fishing,
                        raising mussels, clamming, long lining, lobstering, trawling and others. On
                        this trip, 90 percent of all lobsters caught went back into the ocean, due
                        to size, v-notching (a v-notch is cut out of a bearing female tail to signal
                        it can't be landed because it is a productive animal) or for being "berried"
                        or carrying eggs.

        Debbie Ann leaves the dock. This vessel was tied up in a long divorce
                        proceeding and became a rusted wreck, as seen here. She was then purchased
                        by the RI Engine Company and completely restored and put back into

        The Deborah Lee returns to the port under a cloud of gulls. She had a
                        deckload of herring and drew quite a crowd of admirers on her way in. The

        The dragger Cody hauled out for cleaning, painting and repairs across the
                        pond. This small shipyard once serviced most of the fleet - all except the
                        largest steel draggers, but was closed not long after this photo was taken
                        due to new environmental regulations, further adding to the cost and stress
                        of doing business as a fisherman. Vessels now had to travel to larger yards
                        further away, yards that didn't allow fishermen to work on their own
                        vessels.

        Jerry Babcock cuts the head off a monkfish aboard the Deborah Lee. These
                        fish are mostly mouth and teeth, and fishermen are very careful not to step
                        near them. Monk tails became a delicacy and were then overfished.

        Setting the net aboard the Mikhaela Louise on Georges Bank under dramatic
                        skies. This vessel had two net reels, allowing her to either quickly change
                        net sizes for different fisheries, or have a spare ready to go should the
                        other be torn.

        Luann leads the parade of fishing vessels during the traditional Blessing of
                        the Fleet. After being blessed by a Cardinal, the lead vessel lays a wreath
                        on the water in remembrance of fellow fishermen lost at sea. Once a huge
                        affair in the port, like everything else in the fishery, this ceremony is
                        now a shadow of what it had been. A wild and raucous celebration in the
                        past, the insurance industry decided the boats wouldn't be covered for the
                        event, so now only a handful of commercial boats participate.

        A dogfish jammed in the heavy twine. Dogfish were a constant problem -

                        &amp; chips in England, the processing of dogfish is elaborate as they
                        urinate through their skin and must be carefully handled to achieve
                        food-grade fish.

        The Grandville Davis fishing outside of Block Island. She is a strip built
                        boat - very unusual. She was built for and owned by Chris Brown, and was cut
                        up about 5 years after this photo was taken.

        Anthony Richards brings the scallop dredge aboard the Njord at night. All
                        fishing offshore takes place around the clock, with fishermen catching what
                        sleep they can between haulbacks. On this boat, with only two men, it makes
                        for exhausting trips.

        R.G. Billings fishing alone on the David D just off the Rhode Island
                        coastline. All vessels were sailing shorthanded from the port by this time
                        as the fisheries declined. Fishing alone is quite dangerous, but by this
                        time, many small boats followed this practice to eek out what living they
                        could.

        Cody hauled on a railway opposite Point Jude for painting and repair. This
                        facility closed shortly after because new environmental regulations made the
                        operation too costly to continue. The shipyard was turned into a yachting
                        center, the fate of most waterfront facilities now.

        Net reel covered on a trawler crossing an area closed to fishing.
                        Regulations once forced trawlers to steam all the way around closed areas,
                        but due to cost and time involved, the government eventually allowed
                        trawlers to cover their twine and maintain a high speed while crossing these
                        areas instead. On this trip, heavy wind began to tear the cover off. When
                        fishermen stopped to fix the problem, the vessel was immediately contacted
                        by the government to see what they were doing in a restricted area, as all
                        commercial vessels are tracked 24/7 by the government. Fishermen joke there
                        are more people in government watching fishermen than there are fishermen -
                        something that may be true...

        Stacy Dziekan sorting fish on the Mikhela Louise on an offshore trip for
                        squid. Stacy also served as cook aboard the vessel. In Pt. Judes' peak,
                        trawlers carried a separate man as cook and large crews, but by this time
                        crew had shrunk to the minimum size and fishermen shared all duties. Seen
                        through the waterproof doorway leading into the cabins.

        Jerry Babcock on the Deborah Lee. This trip was to catch skate to be used as
                        lobster bait. The bait was sold to The Bait Company on the Pt. Jude
                        waterfront, who in turn sold it to local lobstermen. Block Island is in the

        Suzanne Beth at the dock. This vessel was a hybrid design - built like an
                        Eastern rig with the high bow and working deck in the center of the vessel,
                        but with a stern reel aft. After hauling, the full net was dragged forward
                        to the center of the vessel for sorting - an attempt to keep the fishermen
                        protected from heavy weather. Unfortunately, on the first voyage, a young
                        crewmember was accidentally wound up in the net and killed, and fishermen
                        never really liked the vessel after that. As an experiment, it never really
                        seemed to work. She was later sold to New Bedford and converted to
                        scalloping.

        A pilot whale breaks the surface on Georges Bank. These whale listen for the
                        sound of trawlers starting to haul back and then swim over to enjoy a feast.
                        They often swim between the vessel and the net coming towards the ship, but
                        never get caught up in the gear. Once fishermen start sorting, fish to be
                        discarded go back overboard down a chute, and these whales simply follow the
                        vessel eating everything that comes off. Once sorting is done, they
                        disappear, only to be seen again at the next haul back.

        Ellen Schomer and Mike Hopkins direct the net as it comes aboard on the
                        Rebecca Mary during a day trip groundfishing in Block Island Sound. The trip
                        was cut short after tearing their net - the tear too big to repair at sea.
                        This was one of Ellen's last trips after 30 years at sea.

        Mike Marchetti after hooking onto a lobster pot buoy. The warp to the set of
                        traps is put into the pot hauler which will bring the traps rapidly to the
                        surface. The pot hauler revolutionized the industry, allowing fishermen to
                        bring more traps on the same warp to the ocean surface from deeper waters
                        with less effort.

        Bow pulpit. Swordfishing was once an important fishery in Pt. Jude, but as
                        with everything else, as technology improved, fishermen were able to
                        overfish the species. Fish were harpooned from these pulpits at one point,
                        but by this time there was no swordfishery left from the Point.

        Iced up trawler. Icing on trawlers can be a deadly condition. When returning
                        home from the warmer waters out on Georges Bank, in blowing winds and cold
                        temperatures, the superstructures on fishing vessels can begin to ice over,
                        and if not knocked off by fishermen can begin to destabilize the ship,
                        causing it to turn turtle. Many crews have been lost when not able to keep
                        up with the icing high above or on the outriggers.

        The Debbie Ann as a rusted hulk. This vessel was tied up in a long divorce
                        proceeding and became a rusted wreck, as seen here. She was then purchased
                        by the RI Engine Company and completely restored and put back into
                        service.

        Striped bass on deck. Note the ironwork used to hold pen boards in position
                        on deck. The entire deck can be sectioned off into pens. These can be used
                        to sort fish, but more importantly, keep the deckload of fish from shifting,
                        destabilizing the vessel or knocking fishermen over.

        A worker from The Bait Company strings skate on the dock. A number of skate
                        are strung together to make one bait that can hang in a lobster trap. Bait
                        such as herring or pogies are stuffed into mesh bags to be hung in traps.
                        Part of the Bait Companies product is to have skates already strung, saving
                        lobstermen time at sea.

                        tight to keep the bag closed. Once hauled on deck, a jerk of the line
                        releases the pursing, spilling the catch onto the deck.

        Suzanne Beth at the dock. This vessel was a hybrid design - built like an
                        Eastern rig with the high bow and working deck in the center of the vessel,
                        but with a stern reel aft. After hauling, the full net was dragged forward
                        to the center of the vessel for sorting, protecting the fishermen from the
                        weather. This was the only vessel built with this combination in mind, and
                        was never very popular. The boat was eventually sold to New Bedford where
                        she was converted to scalloping.

        Compass aboard the Captain Robert with a V-Notching chart in the background.
                        Healthy, bearing female lobsters can have their tails V-Notched by any
                        fishermen to indicate they are breeders. Once notched, it is illegal to land
                        them until the notch is completely gone. In this way, the future of the

        Typical setup for a Rhode Island quahogger. Fishermen build a pilot house in
                        which they stand on their way to and from the quahog grounds. They use bull
                        rakes to bring the clams to the surface in waters as deep as thirty feet, by
                        attaching aluminum pole sections to their rakes. Rhode Island plants seed
                        quahogs deep inside Narragansett Bay, and hires these men to dig them up and
                        move them to cleaner waters at the mouth of the bay. They are dumped there
                        and given sufficient time to clean themselves with cleaner ocean waters
                        before the State will open the area to clamming.

        Stripers on ice. Note the plastic RI State Trap tags - each fish is tagged
                        with a unique number to let fisheries management people know how many
                        stripers are taken by traps. There is a huge fine for not having a tag, so
                        fishermen put them in as soon as they are landed. Traps are given a certain
                        portion of the year's allotment, and once reached, the traps are often
                        hauled for the season.

        Boats hauled on a railway opposite Point Jude for painting and repair. The
                        wooden boat in the foreground never went back into the water. This facility
                        closed shortly after because new environmental regulations made the
                        operation too costly to continue. The shipyard was turned into a yachting
                        center, the fate of most waterfront properties once dedicated to
                        fishermen.

        Summer Girl. Many fishermen, once they get past the age of wanting to go to
                        sea on bigger boats, invest in skiffs or other small boats such as this and
                        dayfish at the end of their careers. With low overhead and less
                        responsibility, they can keep fishing and maintain some income.

        View of a stern ramp on a trawler. The western rig revolutionized the
                        industry. With a net reel aft, the complicated process of setting out or
                        retrieving the net as was done on eastern rigs was reduced to pushing
                        buttons. This, along with improvements in electronic navigation, allowed
                        nearly anyone with the money to get into fishing, leading to the current
                        problems of having overfished New England's waters.

        Pilot whales feeding behind a trawler on Georges Bank. These whales know
                        when a vessel hauls back that dinner is served. They will appear from
                        nowhere and eat the fish discarded from the haulback, disappearing again
                        once the feast is over.

        The old ice house at Point Judith. A newer facility still operates north of
                        this building to provide trawlers with ice for their trips. Once shoreside
                        facilities disappear, they never return. This has happened to nearly every
                        port in New England - waterfront property turns into condos and stores, lost
                        forever to fishermen.

        Raymond Livernois, owner of the Vic Ter Rae, at the helm on Georges Bank.
                        Ray was thrown out of his house as a teenager and started working on the
                        docks, eventually working his way up to owner and captain of one of the
                        biggest vessels in the port. This story was typical for most owners - most
                        started as deckhands and worked their way to the top, something that is no
                        longer possible for young men and women entering the industry as there are
                        no licenses available anymore.

                     The manuscript files have been described in alphabetical order in the finding
                     aid and the photographs are listed in numerical order by ID number. The

                     used as titles. If a description was too long to be an effective title
                     archivists shortened it and recorded the original description in the item's
                     Scope and Content note. The dates come from the files' EXIF metadata except
                     where those dates are clearly inaccurate. Archivists estimated accurate dates

        Robert Miner on tractor on Geo &amp; Carrol Miner Farm round bailing hay
                        into 1000lb bales. This newer technique saves much labor and time over
                        square baling, as square bales must be left to dry for 4-5 days and be
                        stored by hand in barns. Round bales dry one day and are then wrapped in
                        airtight plastic to ferment. They are also stored outside and moved by
                        tractor.

        Linda Miner tedding hay on Cool Breeze Farm. Each farm has numerous tractors
                        going back to the 1940s or 50s - each tractor generally does one or two jobs
                        depending on their size. This also allows farmers to get more done as they
                        don't have to keep switching equipment they tow behind.

        Tractor and manure sprayer on Palmer Farm. This farm and the Beriah Lewis
                        farm spray manure. Their freestall barns are built over a holding tank. Cows
                        stomp their manure through floor grates into this tank where it liquefies.
                        It is pumped from the tank and sprayed on the fields, saving much time and
                        improving penetration.

        Young boys, hired during the summer months, give oxen a daily workout by
                        having them pull weighted sleds around a field. This keeps the animals in
                        shape for summer ox-pulls at country fairs. Beriah Lewis Farm.

        Packing corn silage on Beriah Lewis Farm. Silage is packed with tractors to
                        remove as much air as possible and then covered with plastic tarps to make
                        it as airtight as possible to allow it to ferment without molding. Once
                        packed, it is good for years.

        Crewmen aboard the Eagle and the Maria Mendonsa begin the season's work by
                        building traps they will tend throughout the summer. The Mendonsa fishes
                        three traps in separate locations, taking advantage of the migratory
                        patterns of their target species. Traps, by law, are set in very specific
                        sites, and special permits are required for each. Most trap sites have been
                        in use for over 150 years, and once abandoned, cannot be reopened.

        Trap fishing is a gear-intensive business. The floating trap requires miles
                        of line, acres of nets, hundreds of floats, and thousands of pounds of
                        anchors to moor it all in place. Beyond the gear, however, is the knowledge
                        of how to put it all together and make it work. Passed down through
                        generations of fishermen, this knowledge fades as fewer young men and women
                        enter what remains of this industry.

                        and selling fish, eventually adding traps to their lives as opportunity
                        allowed.

        Steel barrels provide flotation for the trap while anchors weighing up to

                        twine they support generates significant strains that must be held in

        Constructing the trap is an art form in and of itself. The first step is to
                        set the frame of the trap, from which the twine, or netting, will hang.
                        After positioning the numerous lines and barrels of the frame, fishermen
                        tension the trap by pulling its anchors outboard with the ship. With the
                        frame thus set, twine is brought and hung from it. Built into the twine are
                        smaller floats along its entire top edge that not only help suspend the net,
                        but also keep fish from escaping over the upper edge. Lead, iron, or
                        concrete weights hold the bottom of the twine to the sea floor, keeping fish
                        from simply swimming under the netting.

        The Maria Mendonsa, piloted by Luke Wheeler, tows the Eagle sideways using a
                        bridle as they set the leader. Some 1,500' in length, the leader forms a
                        fence as it stretches from the shoreline to the trap, running from the
                        ocean's surface to the sea's floor. As the cable passes across the deck,
                        crew attach the leader's netting to the frame of the trap, which had been
                        set in place the previous day. Buoys support the top edge of the twine while
                        fishermen add weights to the bottom edge of the net before sending it
                        overboard. The leader is a tapered piece of netting made specifically for
                        the particular site the trap occupies, as it must follow the contour of the
                        ocean bed below. Narrow where anchored to the shoreline, it increases in
                        height as the depth of the water becomes greater. The use of powered vessels
                        such as these, rather than the smaller boats once rowed to each trap, is one
                        of the few ways in which trap fishing has changed over the course of
                        time.

        A fisherman tends to the corner barrel as the frame of a trap is anchored
                        into place. Tension from opposing anchors holds the trap in position. To
                        assure the frame is straight, crew in a distant boat will signal the mother
                        ship when the barrel is in line with the others. To communicate this
                        information, an oar held vertically in the workboat is lowered, indicating
                        the exact moment the ship should drop the anchor. Luke Wheeler.

        Alan Glidden, owner of the Black Point Fish Trap Company. Like all trap
                        fishermen, Alan owns numerous trap locations at which he may or may not set
                        nets. Certain species of fish might appear at one trap, but not at others,
                        depending upon their migratory paths or the depth and quality of the water
                        in which it is set. For instance, large amounts of fresh water entering the
                        ocean as runoff from land surrounding a bay after a heavy rainfall may
                        change the salinity of the water, altering the paths fish take as they move
                        along the coast. Variation in the temperature of the water at each site may
                        also help determine a specie's course. Having multiple sites allows
                        fishermen to work different species at different times throughout the summer
                        months. One site may catch scup or bass, while another catches squid. Trap
                        sites further from the coast are held for the day in which other species may
                        be harvested once again. Alan Glidden

        The Christine Roberta's crew assembles for the morning's work at Sakonnet
                        Point. Part of Little Compton, Sakonnet is on the peninsula that forms the
                        eastern boundary of Narragansett Bay along the state's border with
                        Massachusetts. Point Judith, the other port from which trap companies
                        operate, sits on the western mouth of the bay. The building on land directly
                        behind the vessel houses an office for the Parascandolo operation, as well
                        as gear used in the fishery. The large building on the dock to the right
                        functions as a fish handling and shipping center. Fishermen off-load their
                        catch from the boat and into this building by conveyor, where it is sorted
                        and packed with ice for trucking. Trap companies have long operated from
                        both Newport and Sakonnet, but the development of the waterfront in Newport
                        and the corresponding rise in property values drove fishermen to seek new
                        locations from which they could work. At the time of these photos, the
                        Parascandolo family still maintained a wharf on the Newport waterfront for
                        additional operations. There, the family handled landings from trawlers and
                        maintained a fueling operation catering to other local fisheries. Five years
                        later, this wharf too was up for sale.

        Alan Wheeler stands at the helm of the Maria Mendonsa. Adam Lotz, one of
                        Alan's two partners, appears through the pilothouse window in the
                        background. Alan's grandparents shipped fish aboard steamships to numerous
                        markets along the eastern seaboard. Early on, fish were packed with ice into
                        wooden barrels for transportation. Alan is the third generation involved in
                        the fishing industry, while his daughter and two sons represent the
                        fourth.

        The Amelia Bucolo steams from Point Judith to her trap site as the sun rises
                        over Block Island Sound. The morning run to Black Rock is approximately
                        twenty-five minutes, and a more beautiful commute is hard to imagine. The
                        Bucolo is a sister to the Maria Mendonsa, although lengthened by ten feet
                        later in her career. Built as "carry" boats for the trap fishing industry,
                        each vessel can handle tens of thousands of pounds of fish.

        Tom Hoxsie heads out on the North Star to check three traps located around
                        the Harbor of Refuge. With the shortest commute of the four companies, Tom

                        fuel. While an offshore trawler was burning some $1,800 of fuel each day
                        during this trap season, North Star required a mere $800 of fuel over the
                        course of an entire year.

        Crews from Sakonnet prefer to ride to their traps in their longboats. Both
                        operations have sites off Aquidneck Island's shores and others within a few
                        minutes of Sakonnet Harbor. Depending on weather and the number of fish in
                        the trap at each site, they may visit one, two, or all three traps during
                        the day. Three companies use purpose-built steel or aluminum longboats in
                        their daily operations, while Tom Hoxsie works from wooden skiffs he builds
                        himself. The 32' longboats provide a stable work platform for crewmen as
                        they haul twine or perform other tasks related to the business. To help them
                        with their work, the nozzle boat has an onboard winch powered by a gasoline
                        engine, which helps them close the nozzle before they begin hardening the
                        net. In the early part of the last century, crews rowed wooden versions of
                        these boats, built by locals, to the traps. Once there, they loaded them
                        with fish and rowed home. Larger vessels with engines began towing longboats
                        to and from the site when marine engines became both common and cheap.
                        Today, these larger vessels also carry their fish back to port for
                        processing and shipping.

        The Maria Mendonsa turns at the harbor entrance and heads to her first trap.
                        Displacement hulls such as these are not as fast as boats that plane, but
                        are far more economical to operate. Given short distances to trap sites,
                        fuel savings are more valuable than the time they could save with faster
                        boats. The vessel's design also allows fishermen to carry sizeable loads
                        without fear of capsizing. With 30 or 40,000 pounds of fish on deck,
                        stability is of the utmost importance. For electronics, trap boats generally
                        carry a global positioning system, a radio, and radar, although on most days
                        line of sight or compass bearings are adequate. While these vessels have
                        small cabins forward where crew can ride out of inclement weather, they are
                        more commonly used to store foul weather gear and fishing equipment.

        Crew from the Christine Roberta contemplate their approach to a trap. The
                        trap boat releases its longboats while under weigh, allowing momentum to
                        carry them the rest of the way with little assistance. Once released, the
                        longboats separate from each other and head to their individual stations.
                        The actual trap portion of the net—the parlor—consists of a floating box
                        made of twine. Fish seal their fates once they swim up the kitchen's ramp,
                        through the nozzle, and into the parlor. The nozzle, the only way out, is
                        closed by fishermen in the nozzle boat to prevent their escape. Each
                        longboat assumes a position on one of three sides of the parlor, leaving the
                        head of the net for the trap boat itself. Once the ship makes fast to the
                        head-end of the parlor, it lifts it with an onboard winch. In this way, fish
                        forced by the crew to this side of the ship cannot escape over the floats.
                        Tim (?) Menard - brother Stephen Menard fishes with him as well.

        Two crewmembers from the Mendonsa wait at a trap site near the lighthouse at
                        Sakonnet Point. After the longboats get into position on three sides, they
                        also hoist their edge of the parlor into the air and onto the rail of the
                        boat. At this point, they await the signal from the nozzle boat to begin
                        hardening the trap. The angled floats below the lighthouse trace the top
                        edge of the wings, a section of the trap that guides fish further into the
                        kitchen.

        The Amelia Bucolo heads from her berth in Point Judith to the trap at Black
                        Rock on a bright June morning. The essential gear on deck consists of
                        plastic totes and baskets used to separate the catch by species, a large
                        tote in the center of the vessel carrying ice to keep fish cool, and a bull
                        net on the starboard rail used to scoop fish from the trap. The large hatch
                        in the foreground provides access to the hold of the vessel where spare gear
                        is stored. The engine room is beneath the pilothouse and is accessed through
                        the fo'c'sle. Two separate trap companies fish from Point Judith: Tom
                        Hoxsie's operation with the North Star and the Alan Glidden's Black Point
                        Fish Trap Company with the Amelia Bucolo. Point Judith is one of the few
                        remaining deep-sea fishing ports in New England, once holding the position
                        as the ninth largest in the United States. The port's status, as well as the
                        income it generates for the local economy, has declined as new regulations
                        and tightening restrictions end fishing careers. With its unique
                        geographical position, at the divide between the colder northern fisheries
                        and the warmer southern, Point Judith fishermen are known for their
                        adaptability. Draggers, scallopers, gill-netters, lobster and trap fishermen
                        all operate from the port, and many vessels switch gear throughout the
                        course of the year to take advantage of open fisheries.

        Crewmen from the Amelia Bucolo enter the longboats as they approach the
                        trap. Trap fishing requires more people than the typical trawler, as
                        fishermen haul the netting by hand. The Black Point Fish Trap Company
                        employs seven men on the boat throughout the summer. With thousands of
                        pounds of fish in a trap, many hands are required to bring the reluctant
                        mass to the surface. Alan Wheeler on left, Saul Umana on right.

        Saul Umana uses a boathook to pull his skiff into position on one side of
                        the parlor. Floats, occasionally called corks as they were in the past, line
                        the top edge of the twine, keeping fish from going over in their efforts to
                        escape. Saul came with his family to the United States from El Salvador. He
                        worked as a fisherman in his home country and has a son fishing from Point
                        Judith, continuing a family tradition for another generation.

                        pot-hauler raises the net into position, firmly anchoring the vessel until

                        fishery once the trap season closes. Tom Hoxsie converts the North Star back
                        to lobster fishing during the winter months, the job for which she was

        James Main, the captain of the Amelia Bucolo, tends the winch as the head
                        end of the parlor is hauled from the water. Asked how long he has been

                        years old, telling him, "You're going fishing," and he has been at it ever
                        since. Working for most of his life offshore on trawlers, Jim came to trap
                        fishing at the end of his offshore career, making it possible for him to
                        continue fishing while still returning every night to a warm and dry
                        home.

        With the net hauled above the rail, Nick Lord works to lash it to the vessel
                        as Jim looks on. The floats used along the top edge of the net are clearly
                        visible, and the heavy line to which they attach is part of the frame of the
                        trap system. Once deckhands secure the vessel to the net, the entire crew
                        will board the small boats to begin hardening the catch. The fishing
                        industry now has difficulties enticing young men and women into the
                        business, despite its reputation as a place where people with grit and
                        determination can reach the top. There are countless stories of people
                        working their way up the ladder from the position of deckhand to captain. As
                        both state and federal agencies tighten control over fishermen, they reduce
                        the number of licenses available. Young people now have nowhere to go within
                        the industry. Without a license, there is no business for them to create,
                        causing them to seek opportunities in other fields. Nick Lord left, James

        While the design of the floating trap has varied little in 200 years, the
                        most significant change has come with the type of materials used to make the
                        netting. Once made from all natural fibers, such as cotton or hemp, the
                        twine itself would rot beyond use in as little as one or two seasons,
                        depending upon its location within the trap. Today's traps are made of
                        nylon, a material developed just prior to World War II.

        Sam Willis, Ian Campbell, and Tom Hoxsie begin hauling one of their three
                        traps. While Tom's traps may be the smallest, they offer certain advantages.
                        Tom's gear requirements are much less, as is his need for labor. He is fully
                        operational with the North Star, two crewmen, and a single skiff. With these
                        resources, Tom mentioned that he caught enough fish to make some 60,000
                        meals, in addition to the baitfish trapped, over the course of the previous
                        year. Visitors to this site can see much of its layout, traced by floats
                        bobbing on the ocean's surface. The leader net is visible here, centered in
                        the trap and disappearing into the fog in the distance where the far end
                        attaches to a breakwater. This end of the leader meets the wings, which
                        funnel fish further into the trap. Having closed the nozzle behind them,
                        Sam, Ian, and Tom begin hardening the trap by hauling the net into the
                        skiff, forcing the catch towards the North Star. As they work the fish
                        closer to the boat, they drop back overboard the netting previously brought
                        into the skiff, all the while maintaining hold on the edge of the net just
                        coming aboard. This keeps the skiff from filling with twine. Left to right:
                        Sam Willis, Ian Campbell, and Tom Hoxsie.

        Ed Abrantes, Adam Lotz, Alfred Sullivan, Jay Linhares and the youngest of

                        owners of the company, is Nick's father. Both Ed's and Jay's fathers once
                        fished for the company as well. Sully, after fishing for a short period in

                        from the Plumber's Union, he returned to the business of fishing. It is rare
                        to find people who enjoy the work they do as much as fishermen. Despite the
                        many governmental agencies at their shoulders—and fishermen joke there are
                        more people in government offices overseeing what they do than there are
                        fishermen—they love the ocean and dread the day they will be forced to look

        Aaron Taylor works on the control lines leading to the nozzle as Devin

                        into and out of the parlor. While some fish find their way back out of the
                        trap through this opening, most do not. Should trap fishermen reach their
                        daily quota, they can simply leave fish swimming in the trap, without harm,
                        until the next day. Aaron Taylor left, Devin Ferreira right.

        Roland Smith (Bucky), Jim Main, and Rick Cambio work together to keep fish
                        moving towards the Bucolo. They are reducing the area available to fish
                        swimming within the trap, eventually leaving them with no room to escape the
                        bull net used to hoist them to the deck. At this point, crew begin to see
                        what types of fish they have, as the water is now shallow enough for them to
                        be visible from above. The migratory patterns of certain species are
                        remarkably precise, and fish arrive at trap sites generally within a week or
                        two each year as they have for the past hundred. Because of this, fishermen
                        must be ready, or risk losing a major portion of their yearly income.
                        Uncooperative weather at this time of the year leads to worry over their
                        ability to get their traps in place on time. Once the traps are set,
                        however, they look forward to the arrival of great schools of scup, one of
                        their most important species. Left to Right: Roland Smith (Bucky), Jim Main,

        Tom Hoxsie pulling twine in the rain. While in general, commercial fishing
                        seldom stops because of weather, extremely rough days can keep trap
                        fishermen from emptying their nets. The heavy longboats endanger crews'
                        hands and fingers when crashing together as the catch is hardened. Two of
                        Tom's traps are within the breakwaters at the mouth of Point Judith, often
                        providing enough protection from summer storms to allow him to fish while
                        others wait.

        A skate swims near the ocean's surface, searching to escape its predicament.
                        When current regulations allow, skates are generally used as lobster bait,
                        although the "wings" on large skate are suitable for human consumption.
                        Proving too big for the former and too small for the latter, this fish was
                        tossed overboard to swim away and resume its normal life.

        Saul Umana relaxes on the short trip to the site. Trap fishermen leave their
                        docks to begin the day's work at first light, usually between 5:30 and 7:00,
                        depending on the time of year or the captain's inclination. When fish such
                        as scup, striped bass or squid migrate through, crews work six or seven days
                        a week as the majority of their income depends upon these fish. In the
                        middle of the summer, trapping usually slows, and fishermen may skip a day
                        between visits to give traps time to fill.

        While modern technology has made fishing easier in many ways, it is still
                        heavily dependent upon manual labor. Trap fishing remains one of the most
                        elemental of all the commercial fishing technologies, where large groups of
                        men still pull nets by hand. There is a certain beauty in the work they do,
                        although this is more readily appreciated by those not involved in the
                        actual toil.

        The North Star's crew finish hardening the catch. The fish, consisting
                        mostly of pogies, are packed into the little remaining net left to them. To
                        help with the process, Tom slides large dowels through the twine and between
                        the rails of the skiff. These dowels act as spare hands, holding the net
                        they have managed to pull aboard against the struggling fish. Pogies seen
                        making it over the net have only temporarily escaped; they remain in the
                        parlor and are gathered the following day. Tom's traps are well located for
                        catching pogies on their migratory path, although their appearance can seem
                        a mixed blessing. Not overly valuable, they are primarily used as bait, but
                        still provide income with the large numbers caught. To the unaccustomed, it
                        is a spectacular sight when thousands thrash the water to a froth as they
                        are forced to the surface. Raised and dumped into the boat, they make a
                        memorable cacophony as their tails slap the North Star's deck. Left to
                        right: Tom Hoxsie, Sam Willis, Ian Campbell.

        Gulls are constant, if unwelcome, companions to all fishermen. Remarkably
                        adaptable and clever, not to mention eternally hungry, they take full
                        advantage of any situation where they may steal a free lunch. Pilfering is
                        kept to a minimum, however, as there are generally enough crewmen on deck to
                        keep them at bay. Nonetheless, they occasionally swoop in to grab fish from
                        open totes when opportunity calls.

        Aaron Taylor flips a bluefish stuck in the twine back into the trap.
                        Fishermen treat bluefish and their teeth with a healthy dose of respect.
                        Bandaged hands are commonplace as crews handle thousands of them over the
                        course of the season. Frenzied schools of blues can shred the trap's
                        netting, although this was more of a problem in the past when twine was made
                        of cotton.

        Bucky and Jim haul twine. As with many still in the industry, fishing has
                        been a lifelong pursuit. Both men have spent the larger portion of their
                        careers far off Rhode Island's coast on trawlers and swordfish boats. The
                        draggerman's lifestyle is markedly different. Trips lasting anywhere from
                        five to ten days at sea keep them far from home, making family life
                        difficult for all concerned. Trap fishing has become the perfect way for
                        fishermen to do what they know and love without the disadvantages offshore
                        work entails. Trips are short and end where they began every day. The trap
                        season also closes before cold temperatures blanket the region, and while
                        the work is hard, it is not carried out around the clock as it is at sea.
                        For young crewmen, trapping can be the beginning of a career or a summer's
                        job, tiding them over as they plan their next move. Like all outdoor jobs,
                        there are people who fish because they dread a working life surrounded by
                        walls. Fishing offers an alternative to the typical nine-to-five job many
                        others enjoy. Roland Smith (Bucky) left, James Main right.

        Bucky climbs aboard the Amelia Bucolo. At this point, the net has been
                        hardened and the fish are ready to bail from the trap. Bucky returns to the
                        deck to help land and sort the catch. The other three: Nick Lord, Tom
                        Hinckley, and Rick Cambio remain in the longboat, continuously hardening the
                        net as others remove the fish. Trap fishing is much like opening a grab bag.
                        Except for times when the entire catch is composed of a single species, most
                        days offer a variety. On any given day, the nets may include scup, albacore,
                        striped bass, sea bass, flounder, skate, dogfish, butterfish, menhaden,
                        false albacore, ocean sunfish, squid, whitefish, weakfish, stingray,
                        blackfish, fluke, eel, sea robin, or any other number of species. One
                        exciting day, an enormous tuna entered a trap at Sakonnet Point. Once a
                        common occurrence, fishermen noted this was unlikely to happen again for
                        another dozen years. On another day, this particular crew found a great
                        white shark swimming in their trap. Fortunately, the fish seemed subdued by
                        the time the crew arrived and released it back into the sea. Left to right:

        Alan Glidden, after closing the nozzle, begins to haul the trap itself.
                        Alan's enthusiasm for trap fishing stems from both the green nature of the
                        fishery as a whole, and from the quality of the fish they produce. Scooped
                        from the ocean as if it were nothing more than an oversized aquarium, fish
                        are seldom damaged as they are with other methodologies.

        The entire crew hardens the catch against the starboard side of the Maria
                        Mendonsa. In the heyday of trap fishing, when over a hundred men might have
                        worked for one company, this would have been considered a small crew. Alan
                        Wheeler's crew count rises and falls to match his needs.

                        handling the net, will swing it overboard where men in the longboat guide it
                        into the thick of the catch. When full, Nick gives a shout to the man
                        tending the winch to lift them aboard. Crew in the longboats guide the net

                        the other side of the vessel. Everyone on deck is careful to stand clear, as
                        there is little chance of halting its swing. The bull net's clever design
                        allows it to open under load, something that helps fishermen quickly empty
                        the trap. The bottom of the net purses together with chain. At the right
                        moment, Nick releases this pursing, dumping the fish on deck where they are
                        sorted into baskets, totes, and barrels. Left to right: Thomas Hinclkey,

        Thousands of menhaden thrash the little bit of ocean left to them. This
                        species seems to have more names than any other found in New England, a
                        reflection perhaps of their widely ranging habitat. The Atlantic menhaden,
                        also called mossback or bunker, swims in waters from Nova Scotia to the
                        coast of Florida. Usually referred to locally as pogies, they die easily and
                        spoil rapidly. Beyond that, they are oily and bony creatures generally unfit
                        for human consumption, although they are processed for their Omega-3 oils.
                        Pogies school by the millions while out to sea, and when they hit, fill
                        traps quite rapidly. While trappers sell them as bait, larger fishing
                        operations seining for menhaden sell them as a food source for other animals
                        such as pigs, chickens, household pets, or farm-raised fish such as salmon.

        Sully leans against the winch drum as he watches the coastline pass by. The
                        winch is one of the more important pieces of gear on the boat, responsible
                        for all of the heavy lifting. Note the deep grooves worn into the drum's
                        bronze surface by rope bearing heavy loads, a true measure of the work done
                        by this machine over many years of operation. Alfred Sullivan.

        Between each pass of the bull net, the crew continues condensing the fish
                        still within the trap. The port deck of the vessel has been heavily loaded,
                        so the remaining fish will go to the starboard side to keep her on an even
                        keel. This trip consisted largely of striped bass and bluefish, with the
                        usual handful of other species. The aft deck of this boat, as with all large
                        fishing vessels, is readily divided into pens. This makes a convenient way
                        to separate species, but more importantly, it keeps thousands of pounds of
                        slippery fish from careening across the deck in rough weather. Not only
                        dangerous to crew caught in the avalanche, this quick shift of weight can
                        dangerously affect the stability of the ship itself.

        Striped bass are highly prized, to both sports and commercial fishermen
                        alike. Because of this, heated controversy surrounds this particular
                        species. Local sportsmen prefer stripers to almost all other finfish and
                        feel commercial ventures cut into their share of fun. The Rhode Island
                        Fisheries Management Report for this year sheds interesting light on the
                        technologies used to catch them. In 2008, the quota for striped bass in
                        Rhode Island was divided between floating trap fishermen, who were allowed
                        40 percent of the annual quota, and rod and reelers, who took a 60 percent
                        share of the allowed catch. In that year, the rod and reel quota of 145,918
                        pounds was taken in a mere 20 days, while trap fishermen took most of the
                        summer to fill their quota of 97,450 pounds, a reflection of the relatively
                        passive nature of the fishery. By law, commercial fishermen must record
                        every striped bass they catch on a daily basis, turning over their logs to a
                        fisheries management agency each week to assure an accurate account of the
                        fish taken. In addition, they must place a trap tag through the mouth and
                        gills of each bass caught or face significant fines. Fishermen place these
                        tags long before their boats reach the dock to insure themselves against
                        harsh penalties.

        Sam Willis empties the trap's contents onto the sorting table aboard the
                        North Star. A longtime crewmember on the boat, Sam works as a fisherman
                        during the trapping season and heads south to work on his family's cattle
                        ranch for the remainder of the year. Originally designed to fish for
                        lobsters, North Star works well as a trap boat. Built of fiberglass, she has
                        lower maintenance requirements than those of either wooden or steel vessels.
                        While somewhat small for their biggest day's fishing, her size helps keep
                        overhead costs low. It is also easy for Tom to switch fisheries at the end
                        of the trapping season; he simply removes the portable sorting table and
                        loads the boat with lobster traps. As with most people working within the
                        industry, Tom is largely self-sufficient. To survive financially, fishermen
                        don't have the luxury of calling in outside tradesmen to fix problems
                        arising on a near-daily basis. Beyond mending their own nets, fishermen
                        repair their own engines, mechanical and electrical systems, and other
                        essential gear. They construct their own skiffs and pull worn hull plating
                        from workboats before welding on new. Fishermen design and build new gear to
                        make life easier, safer, or in difficult economic times, more efficient, all
                        while operating a successful fishing business.

        Sam hoists a stingray from the trap as Tom holds its tail to control its
                        movements. Once raised high enough, Ian will pull the net away from the hull
                        to allow the fish to slip between it and the boat when released. Stingrays
                        are also treated with caution, as their whip-like tails conceal a
                        dangerously large and serrated barb with which they strike. Much larger rays
                        than this have been pulled from the trap. Left to right: Ian Campbell, Tom

        Scup, also known as porgies, are one of the most valuable species, much as
                        they were to fishermen working the coastline in the 1800s. Ranging from Cape
                        Cod to South Carolina, they are known for their light taste and the fight
                        they give when hooked. Spawned near the inner-continental shelf, the highly
                        buoyant eggs drift to protected coastal waters. The average porgie weighs
                        between one and two pounds and matures between two and three years of age,
                        but can reach three to four pounds and lengths of up to eighteen inches. A
                        homely fish with a large forehead and a small mouth, the bodies are a dull
                        silvery color with traces of light blue throughout. A series of horizontal
                        lines run the length of their bodies, and they are topped with a spiny
                        dorsal fin. Scup winter in deep waters, between the middle and outer
                        continental shelves, only returning to the Rhode Island coast as the waters
                        warm. In one remarkable run, George Mendonsa recalled removing 100,000
                        pounds each day for an entire month from a single trap. Today, trap
                        fishermen try to stretch their quota over the entire length of the scup run,
                        helping to maintain market prices by not exceeding demand.

        The Bucolo is shown here tied to the head of the trap at Black Rock, east of
                        Point Judith. The seven-member crew is aft, sorting fish they have taken
                        from the nets. There are relatively few places left in the United States
                        where trap fishing still occurs, and while the smallest state in the union,
                        Rhode Island leads the nation in trap sites. Nearly half of the sites in the
                        country are within this state, with the majority of them between Newport and
                        Sakonnet Point.

        Anthony Parascandolo wrestles an American torpedo back overboard. This
                        unusual fish has been plentiful in Rhode Island waters in recent summers. Of
                        no commercial value, these large and blubbery animals easily reach hundreds
                        of pounds, and fishermen handle them with kid, if not rubber, gloves.
                        Although not as famous as the electric eel, the torpedo can discharge a
                        shock of nearly 200 volts.

        Ian stands ankle deep in menhaden on the deck of the North Star. The
                        brightly silvered pogie has a distinctive spot behind each gill. Striped

        Ian unceremoniously tosses a small striped bass back into the ocean. This
                        removable table makes it easier for the North Star's crew to sort fish they
                        will keep from those they return to the sea. Trapping is perhaps the
                        greenest of the commercial fisheries, with its low fuel and refrigeration
                        requirements. More importantly, however, is the nearly complete lack of
                        bycatch. Fish caught in the trap that fishermen are not allowed to keep are
                        known as bycatch. They may be too small, like the striper in the photograph,
                        not edible, or simply not allowed under current regulations. In trapping,
                        fishermen sort the catch as it is brought onto the deck. Unwanted fish go
                        back overboard and swim away. While there will inevitably be some fish lost,
                        it is not unusual to see but a handful die in a catch of thousands and
                        thousands of pounds. Trap fishermen can easily select target species from
                        the pile and discard the rest. Ian Campbell.

        Sam Willis at work in the skiff. Fishing, to most commercial fishermen, is
                        much more than a job. The crew from the North Star keeps fishing poles
                        aboard for use later in the day. Throwing pogies into a tote of water as
                        they empty their traps provides them with live bait with which to tempt
                        striped bass. Leaving the North Star tied to the trap, they often take the
                        skiff to try their hand in fifteen minutes of sport fishing before heading
                        home.

        Despite the widespread use of electronics, it is still possible to find
                        magnetic compasses on commercial fishing vessels. Elegantly designed
                        instruments that respond magically to invisible forces, they are often the

                        and radar to get them safely to and from their traps, but the compass has
                        the advantage of simplicity working in its favor. When all else fails,
                        knowledge and a compass brings them home.

        The Maria Mendonsa turns from the trap and heads home with a deck loaded
                        with fish. Fishermen are, by both nature and necessity, masters of many
                        trades. In tough economic times, simply knowing how to fish is not enough.
                        Fishermen must know how to maintain and repair all of the complicated gear
                        they use or add to their financial burdens. Beyond knowing how to repair
                        nearly everything they use, fishermen must also excel in the business of
                        handling and marketing their catch. Where, when, and how to sell their fish
                        are critical decisions that can make or break an entire summer's effort.
                        Additionally, rapidly changing regulations must be understood, increasing
                        the number of meetings they attend as well as the volume of paperwork they
                        read in their efforts to stay informed.

        Christine Roberta steams across choppy waters in early June on her way to
                        the trap off Aquidneck Island. A steel-hulled vessel built for work as an
                        offshore lobster boat, her large aft deck makes her suitable for trap
                        fishing as well. At the end of the season, she is leased to continue work as
                        a gill-netter throughout the winter months. The decline in business at the
                        other Parascandolo operation in Newport is indicative of the plight of the
                        fishing industry overall. At one time, a large part of the New Bedford fleet
                        unloaded their catch at their Newport facility, often three vessels at once.
                        Anthony Parascandolo notes that they are now lucky to unload three vessels
                        per week. Aquidneck Island, long known as the center of East Coast yachting,
                        was once a hub for the trap fishing industry, and the vessels from Sakonnet
                        still have traps whose leaders begin on its shoreline. Newport became a
                        summer playground for the rich during the 19th century, and dozens of
                        imposing mansions were built along the island's coastline. These monuments
                        to wealth stand in dramatic contrast with the activities of local working
                        fishermen, who continue setting their nets where rolling green lawns meet
                        the water's edge.

        Donald Rosinha stops to answer a question while hauling a trap. As with many
                        others, Don briefly fished before pursuing a more lucrative professional
                        career off the water. After retirement, he came back to fishing on the
                        Christine Roberta. In addition to fishing, Don and his wife operate a small
                        restaurant in a nearby town.

        Crew from the Maria Mendonsa stand silhouetted by the early morning light as
                        they begin rowing their boats towards the next trap. The trap season is
                        busiest at both ends of the summer. Fish migrating north at the beginning of
                        the year provide large catches, as they do in the fall on their journey back
                        towards warmer waters.

        Crew from the Maria Mendonsa work on calm seas to repair a leader cut by a
                        passing yachtsman. The ocean, if nothing else, is certainly a beautiful
                        place to work. As one fisherman noted, there are few offices with views
                        which can compare. This lighthouse, built atop Little Cormorant Rock in
                        1884, once contained a fourth-order Fresnel lens, some seventy feet above
                        the ocean's surface, which twice stood against storm waves that matched its
                        height. Many older fishermen talk of themselves as having been "fished."
                        Perhaps more than other professions, fishermen have more opportunities to
                        practice "take a child to work day." In tight-knit communities, fishermen
                        know the children prowling their docks and go out of their way to include
                        them in their daily lives, giving them bait with which to fish, allowing
                        them to soil their clothes in the engine room, and lending them a skiff for
                        adventures across the harbor. It may be nothing more than the attention and
                        responsibility given them that lead children down this particular path, but
                        once hooked, they seldom chose to escape.

        Jim Main, Bucky Smith and Rick Cambio grab onto one edge of the parlor on a
                        blustery day. Days like this make work more difficult, but no money is made
                        while sitting idly in port. Like all commercial fisheries, trapping is
                        highly regulated. Scientists working for the federal government decide the
                        year's quota for each species, based on how they feel the fish are doing as
                        a whole. As with most living creatures, fish populations are generally
                        cyclical and difficult to count or track. As fishermen note, they have tails
                        and swim away. Rhode Island receives a larger portion of the federal quota
                        because traps along the state's coastline have always been productive. Back
                        to front: Jim Main, Rick Cambio, Roland Smith.

        Aaron Taylor stands in the bow of a longboat as they begin hardening the
                        net. The day's catch consisted largely of scup, as great schools began
                        passing this section of coastline on their migratory swim. This boat is made
                        of aluminum, much lighter than the older steel boats used by the Amelia
                        Bucolo's crew. As an added benefit, aluminum boats require little
                        maintenance at the end of the season, whereas the steel boats need new coats
                        of paint at a minimum.

        View from the pilothouse on the Maria Mendonsa. A straightforward control
                        center, the house contains a bronze wheel for steering, a magnetic compass,
                        the throttle and gear shift for the main engine, and both a radar screen and
                        a satellite navigation system hanging from the overhead. The paper form
                        taped to the console is a deviation card for the compass. Surrounded by iron
                        and steel, the compass seldom points towards true north. This card gives the
                        helmsman corrections to add to any particular course heading chosen,

        Striped bass that are too small to keep make their exit. This process
                        assures little to no bycatch; fishermen only retain the size and type of

        Portrait of Ed Abrantes. Part of the problem today's fishermen face stems
                        from their independent natures. The fishing industry is a highly politicized
                        business, with many interested groups striving to make their voices heard.
                        Fishermen realize they fare better as a group speaking as one to their
                        elected representatives, but a sense of independence and demands on their
                        time often keep them from organizing in a meaningful way.

        Crew harden the Sakonnet Point trap. A significant amount of handwork goes
                        into building each trap. While the twine itself is made by machine,
                        fishermen must do the rest by hand to finish the structure. One new problem
                        for trap fishermen is there are only a few people left who know how to build
                        a trap from scratch. Today, fishermen repair traps as needed, and it is
                        unlikely that any new traps will be built. It is possible to trace the use
                        of this type of trap back several thousand years to the Romans. There are
                        large floating traps in the Mediterranean still used to catch the giant
                        bluefin tuna that migrate into the area on a yearly basis. Many of these
                        traps have remained in the same family for hundreds of years. The bluefin
                        caught there are too large to bring aboard with a bull net. After trapping
                        the tuna, a traditional "matanza," or killing of the fish, takes place.
                        Fishermen spear and bleed the largest of the tuna before they gaff and haul
                        them aboard. For thousands of years, the very same traps set in the very
                        same locations have proved a source of great wealth in the Mediterranean
                        Sea, although fishing with modern equipment now threatens their future as
                        well.

        Maria Mendonsa circles to the east as her boats maneuver into position and
                        ready the trap for hauling. On one particular day, this trap contained some
                        40,000 pounds of false albacore. Proving too heavy, the crew split the trap
                        open and allowed them to escape. Having re-sewn the net, the Mendonsa
                        returned the next day to pull the 15,000 pounds of fish caught once
                        again.

        Anthony Parascandolo and his crew pull twine at the Aquidneck Island trap.
                        Anthony started work within the family business while in grade school.
                        Getting off the bus at the end of the day, he would help repair wooden
                        crates used to ship fish to New York and Philadelphia, or dump fish
                        off-loaded from trawlers onto sorting tables. At that young age, it was
                        necessary for him to stand on a crate and several lids just to reach the
                        work. Anthony Parascandolo, Stephan Menard behind and to left.

        The bull net on the North Star swings a load of striped bass aboard as other
                        fish leap clear of the water in vain attempts to escape. Trap fishing is one
                        of the cleanest ways to catch fish: they are not brought to the surface from
                        great depths, they have not been dragged around, and no hooks damage their
                        mouths.

        Standing in the pilothouse doorway, Jim Main waits for the longboat crews to
                        locate themselves around the trap before swinging the Bucolo into position.
                        One unexpected problem occurs when regulations remove a species from the
                        allowable catch list; the demand for that type of fish disappears. Now
                        unfamiliar, younger consumers are less likely to purchase the fish when they
                        return to the marketplace, and fillet-of-squarefish becomes the new
                        standard.

        Sea robins swim towards the ocean's surface within the trap. The origin of
                        their name is obvious given the large, wing like, pectoral fins spread to
                        their sides. While swimming, they are visually stunning, but once landed,
                        their wings fold and they become rather homely. Their sharp spines make
                        careful handling a necessity, and they occasionally make croaking sounds
                        when removed from the water. They use their six, leg-like appendages to stir
                        sediments on the ocean's floor as they search for food or bury themselves as
                        they wait for unsuspecting prey, simultaneously hiding from those who would
                        prey upon them. Their beautiful red and orange bodies reach lengths of up to
                        twelve inches, although their emerald green eyes, surrounded by an
                        opalescent gold ring, are their most compelling feature. While edible, sea
                        robin are seldom eaten; they are usually kept by fishermen to be sold as
                        bait.

        Bonito caught on a warm summer day are kept cold in a tote of ice and water
                        until they reach the docks. These steely-blue fish have all the earmarks of
                        high-speed predators. Tough and streamlined, these animals are known for
                        both the velocity at which they swim and their voracious appetites. They can
                        reach 32" in length and weigh eight to twelve pounds. As can be seen in this
                        photograph, they have a row of sharp teeth on the bottom jaw, but unlike
                        many of their cousins, no teeth on top. They prey on mackerel, menhaden,
                        squid, silversides, sandlance, and alewives, and are in turn eaten by
                        predatory fish both larger and faster.

        Ian Campbell displays a spider crab before tossing it back into the waters
                        outside of the trap. These crabs, which have no commercial value, create
                        real headaches when the become entangled in the twine. Unfortunately, they
                        are plentiful in the area where Tom Hoxsie sets his traps. Tom has
                        discovered that crabs do not seem to foul netting made from polypropylene,
                        and hopes to replace twine on the bottom of the trap with poly to minimize
                        this problem.

                        their rails without capsizing. Long before the advent of powered vessels,
                        they also functioned as carry boats, bringing home the day's catch.

        A view from the beach of the Amelia Bucolo at the Black Rock trap site.
                        Records from the 1880s, long before trawlers came upon the scene, show
                        trapping to be vastly superior to other techniques in use at the time.
                        Dozens of trap sites, as well as hundreds of fykes, heart traps, and pounds,
                        filled nearly every bay, with floating traps extending the fisherman's reach
                        offshore. The town of Tiverton hosted a public drawing for eighteen trap
                        sites available on its shores alone, keeping each trap sixty-five fathoms
                        from the next.

        Two of Tom Hoxsie's skiffs are left tied to the North Star after completion
                        of the morning's work. As with most fishermen, Tom is a man of many talents.
                        He builds his own skiffs as needed, which not only saves him the added
                        expense of having them built, but also allows him to produce exactly what he
                        needs. Wooden skiffs of this type have always played a role on the local
                        waterfront, having proved themselves efficient, seaworthy, and economically
                        viable.

        Three silvery moonfish. While many unusual species come aboard, the moonfish
                        is certainly one of the most beautiful. Ranging in size from that of a
                        quarter to a half-dollar, they are reminiscent of silver coins when
                        sprinkled across the black deck of a trap boat. Thin as quarters as well,
                        they desiccate rapidly, and according to Alan Glidden, they were often taken
                        home by fishermen who varnished and hung them as ornaments on Christmas
                        trees.

        North Star heads back into Point Judith from the traps at the east end of
                        the harbor. Two cormorants watch her progress, one drying its wings on the
                        rocks and another actively fishing in the water to the left. Tom stops at
                        the buyer's dock on the way back to his berth. After weighing his catch, the
                        buyer gives him a receipt for his records. Baitfish, such as menhaden,
                        skate, or sea robin, are kept aboard and brought back to his dock,
                        conveniently located amongst the lobster fleet. Before World War II, there
                        were many more traps around the stone breakwaters protecting the harbor. At
                        that time, fish were scooped from traps by hand and dumped into skiffs
                        before they were towed back to be unloaded. Fish with little value were
                        taken to a plant in town and rendered into oils for paint or fishmeal to
                        feed cattle.

        The crew from the Maria Mendonsa packs the day's catch. The plastic barrels
                        in the foreground are for baitfish. Crew sort fish destined for New
                        England's kitchens and pack them with ice in waxed, cardboard cartons. Long
                        gone are the days of wooden barrels and packing crates that held hundreds of
                        pounds of fish. Aaron Taylor (center)

        Pogies are salted and stored in plastic barrels. These oily fish make
                        excellent bait for crustaceans. As they decompose within wire-mesh traps,
                        their scent attracts hungry lobsters and crabs. Lobstermen have learned to
                        take advantage of the differing rates of decay for each species of fish.
                        While pogies decompose too quickly in warm summer waters, they are perfect
                        for cold winter temperatures. Skates, a much tougher fish, provide the right
                        amount of decay during the summer.

        A bluefish heads down the conveyor belt to be packed in ice for shipping.
                        Blues will snap at anything within reach, and will even attack each other
                        when the school's aggressive behavior becomes frenzied. It is not unusual to
                        haul fish from the trap with enormous bites taken from their sides by blues,
                        or to see them devouring fish as they themselves are lifted from the ocean.
                        Blues prefer to eat menhaden, squid, weakfish, grunts and shrimp, but seem
                        willing to devour whatever appears before them. Even women wearing shiny
                        jewelry while swimming have been bitten. Bluefish take their name from the
                        beautiful blue and green colors of their upper back. This tapers to silver
                        along their sides before turning a creamy white on their bellies. Their
                        tails are deeply forked, and the spiny dorsal fin easily pierces one's skin.
                        They live in most of the world's temperate oceans, and along our Atlantic
                        Coast from Argentina to Nova Scotia. They appear in Rhode Island's waters in
                        June and disappear in October as the sea begins to chill.

        Luke Wheeler and his daughter stand at the conveyor, sorting fish from the
                        day's catch. As a boy, Luke began lobstering from a skiff with his father on
                        the rocky shores of Aquidneck Island. A graduate of Maine Maritime, he chose
                        to fish rather than pursue a career on other types of commercial vessels.
                        Luke also owns and operates the Shirley Ann, a day boat he fishes from the
                        Point when done with the day's trapping.

        Totes of newly-landed fish, separated by species, await boxing. Few
                        Americans will purchase a whole fish such as these anymore. Once docks
                        brimmed with people waiting to pick the fish they would eat for dinner, but
                        consumers are now far more likely to pull a box from the local grocer's
                        freezer. Today, less than 10 percent of the fish we consume in this country
                        comes from local waters.

        Crewmembers weigh fish with this hanging scale before placing them in

                        scales, is calibrated periodically by governmental inspectors. The tangible
                        sense of history and tradition etched into the chipped paint on its ancient

        Squid on deck. These cephalopods have enormous eyes, the giant squid having
                        the largest of any animal alive. Propelled by jets of water, they capture
                        their prey within their eight arms and twin tentacles before tearing them
                        apart with a sharp, beak-like mouth. Not only can squid blend into their
                        surrounds by varying the color and patterning on their skin, they also
                        generate clouds of black ink to help them elude predators.

        Fishermen remove twine from the frame. Hauling the net vertically using the
                        ship's winch, crewmen pin it to the rail while the portion above is lowered
                        to the deck, allowing another bight of netting to be raised from the sea. As
                        the twine is brought aboard, the cast weights that held the lower edge of
                        the net to the ocean floor are removed. Early on, fishermen used stones to
                        keep twine in place, although these were quickly replaced as weights cast in
                        metal became cheaper. While iron became the standard, even lead was used
                        when economical. Today, when older weights are lost, substitutions are made
                        with ready-made objects such as links from navy anchor chain. Cast concrete
                        weights are occasionally used, but they "float" more than their denser
                        counterparts and are relegated to sections near rocky beaches where they are
                        more likely to be lost.

        The crew from the North Star loads a leader net into a skiff on yet another
                        dreary day. Twine is usually pulled for inspection and cleaning during lulls

                        from the mesh as they go, a job far more tedious than one might imagine. Sam

        Sam Willis works to reattach the leader's twine to the Breakwater Village
                        trap at the east end of the harbor. While Tom's traps may be the smallest,
                        this image provides a feeling for just how big they are still. The skiff is
                        only two-thirds the distance to the shore end of the leader. Tom hires Joe
                        Whaley, a retired local fisherman, to do much of the repair work on his
                        nets, although many of his own hours are spent at this task off-season. The
                        twine itself represents a significant expense, not only for the inherent
                        material costs, but for the labor involved when constructing a trap. Anthony
                        Parascandolo estimated building a full-sized trap from scratch would now
                        take two men nearly six months, working six days a week at that.

        A longboat from the Christine Roberta stops to repair a cut leader.
                        Inexperienced yachtsmen, flooding the coast during the summer months,
                        represent a continuous problem for trap fishermen. Although each trap's
                        exact position is marked on charts and hundreds of floats, barrels, and
                        radar buoys make them visible, both sail and speedboats manage to run afoul.
                        Yachtsmen cut their way out of their mistakes, leaving extra work and lost
                        profits in their wakes.

                        Concern over getting this task done safely left him uncharacteristically

                        them throughout the year. Corey Wheeler Forrest has learned many of these
                        skills by working with older fishermen and also spends time repairing twine
                        in the hot summer sun.

        The Eagle rests at her mooring as the sun begins to burn through the early
                        morning fog. As with most harbors, the number of working watercraft
                        continues to dwindle, with pleasure boats filling the moorings left behind.
                        This harbor is no different, as evidenced by the large yacht club just
                        completed next to the trap companies' operations.

        Portrait of Dan MacDonald. Alan Wheeler loves to ski and works at a resort
                        in the winter months up north. Dan is one of the snow-makers Alan brings
                        south for the summer to work as crew on the Maria Mendonsa. For men and
                        women who prefer to work outside, trap fishing provides the opportunity to
                        fish without having to go offshore on extended trips.

        Ian Campbell sits in the rain as the boat heads to the East Wall trap. Two
                        of North Star's leaders begin on the massive stonework forming the Harbor of
                        Refuge. Construction on these breakwaters, nearly 13,000 feet in length,
                        began in 1891 and finished in 1914, providing a safe haven for vessels
                        traveling the coast. Using several million tons of stone, the breakwaters
                        are 20 feet wide at the top and rise in places from waters 34 feet deep.

        Anthony Parascandolo operates the ship's winch, lifting another load of scup
                        from the sea. In many ways, fishermen are much like farmers, even ignoring
                        the obvious parallels in food production. Weather and other elements beyond
                        their control often affect their livelihoods. In a few critical summer
                        months, drastic changes in environmental conditions can seriously impact
                        their ability to make a living. As with New England's farmers, fishermen are
                        dependent on specific and expensive equipment to make thin profit margins
                        work, and maintaining that equipment adds much to the overall cost. Finally,
                        trap fishermen and farmers were once major food producers for the area, and
                        both are rapidly disappearing from the Northeast.

        Tom Hinckley and Saul Umana work together to keep their side of the parlor's
                        twine above water. The netting used in traps is dipped in liquid tar, giving
                        it a distinctive black color. Early on, tar preserved the cotton fibers from
                        which twine was made. While twine made of nylon won't rot, this added layer
                        of protection helps to reduce physical wear as well as UV damage from

        Portrait of Rick Cambio. A career fisherman, Rick has worked on traps and as
                        a draggerman far out to sea. This summer, after finishing the morning's
                        work, Rick went to work cutting apart a wooden dragger that was no longer
                        commercially viable. Point Judith's fleet has dwindled significantly over
                        the course of the past ten years.

        Adam and Sully clean the deck while James rests in the longboat. While
                        younger crewmen generally chat on the way to the site, the more experienced
                        members on deck seem always in motion, taking care of little details that
                        assure a smooth day of fishing. Fish species appear at the same time each
                        year with great predictability, as a trap fisherman of 1871 relates: "In the
                        remarks of Mr. E. W. Whalley, of Narragansett Pier, we find a statement of
                        the usual sequence of fish at Point Judith, and are presented at the same
                        time with a most charming fragment of folk-lore. In reply to the inquiry as
                        to whether fish were not earlier arrived at that point than usual, he
                        replied: "About the same. They expected them in February and got the seines
                        ready. They had them in the water in March. I always judge by the
                        dandelions. When I see the first dandelion, scup come in; I watch the buds,
                        and when the buds are swelled full then our traps go in; when the dandelion
                        goes out of bloom and goes to seed, the scup are gone. That is true one year
                        with another, though they vary with the season. I am guided by the blossoms
                        of other kinds of plants for other fish. When high blackberries are in bloom
                        we catch striped bass that weigh from 12 to 20 pounds. When the blue violets
                        are in blossom—they come early—you can catch the small scoot-bass. That has
                        always been my rule; that has been handed down by my forefathers." Left to
                        right on deck: Adam Lotz, Alfred Sullivan.

        Bucky Smith holds the twine in place as he waits for the signal to begin
                        hauling. Commercial fishing is a rigorous game, better suited to the young
                        and strong. With an average age of 55, a significant portion of New
                        England's fishermen are now approaching retirement, leaving the industry
                        with challenges in this arena as well. Captains often complain the trade is
                        no longer passed to younger generations; finding young men or women with
                        even the most basic skills has become nearly impossible. Roland Smith

        Ian Campbell and Tom Hoxsie pull twine on the East Wall set. Tom, who has
                        been trap fishing for more than twenty-five years, feels there may be a
                        better future in harvesting fish by trap than by trawler. Low overhead and a
                        green footprint could help revive the industry. Ian Campbell left, Tom

        The Amelia Bucolo returns to Point Judith after hauling her trap. Both the
                        Bucolo and the Maria Mendonsa were built by Gladding and Hearn on the
                        Taunton River in nearby Somerset, Massachusetts. Begun in 1955, the shipyard
                        still builds steel and aluminum vessels, a rarity on the East Coast. The
                        Bucolo, built in 1965, is still powered by her original Caterpillar 342
                        engine. Alan Glidden estimates her fuel consumption at five gallons per
                        hour, burning a few hundred gallons every three weeks. Fishing, unlike many
                        careers today, has always been a trade passed down by one generation to the
                        next. Age and experience has taught youth and enthusiasm. While there are a
                        few schools still offering some training in the business, most fishermen
                        start on the back deck of a fishing boat willing to take them to sea. The
                        fishing industry is democratic by nature. As a fisherman once told me, who
                        you were, where you came from, or what you had previously done wasn't
                        important. What mattered was how you did your job, and any fisherman who put
                        in effort could expect to see results over time. Young workers once entered
                        the trade dreaming of the vessel they would eventually command, and the
                        majority of Rhode Island's fishing captains began their climb to the
                        pilothouse from the lowest rung on the ladder.

        Gear once again covers the wharf at the summer's end. Anchors, buoys, nets,
                        line, and the vessels themselves are retired for winter. The season ends
                        abruptly when quotas for the year are filled. Once over, the crew's last job
                        before dispersing is to gather back this gear. The twine is removed from the
                        frames and brought ashore for drying and storage. Frames come next—the
                        thousands of yards of line and the buoys that kept the trap afloat
                        throughout the summer months. Finally, the 1,000-pound anchors are swung
                        aboard for the trip back to their winter home along the waterfront. In the
                        past, companies employed trap crews of hundreds of men on a year-round
                        basis. They often fished a longer season when weather allowed, and when
                        fishing ended, there were still new traps to build and twine to repair.
                        Today, small crews disband and look for new work to tide them over the long
                        winter months. Some stay within the fisheries while others go ashore to jobs
                        with no ties to the sea. Yachts moored in the harbor begin to disappear as
                        the winter intrudes, and Sakonnet Point settles into the role of icy
                        gatekeeper at the mouth of the bay, quiet and deserted until spring arrives
                        once again.

        A Parascandolo &amp; Sons Trap Company truck sits at a barn located a few
                        miles from Sakonnet Point. The barn stores trap gear through the winter
                        months. These stainless steel trailers are in big demand on the waterfront,
                        not subject to the quick decay modern aluminum trailers face when exposed to
                        the saltwater environment. Used not only to transport and store gear, many
                        of them are refrigerated and hold daily catches until ready for shipment. As
                        with any product, market prices vary with the demand for any particular
                        species and the available supply. While allowed to catch fewer fish than in
                        the past, higher prices in the marketplace for smaller quantities have
                        helped offset some of the financial loss brought about by regulations. As
                        waterfront property over the course of the last thirty years became more
                        desirable, fishermen have been forced to move parts of their operations away
                        from the ocean to more affordable locations, again increasing their costs.
                        Housing for the wealthy continues to envelope the working waterfront and its
                        supporting infrastructure. Newport, once a major fishing center, now caters
                        only to yachtsmen and tourists. Even the loss of local hayfields to
                        developers robs the trap fisherman of important space. Only time will tell
                        how much longer this industry can survive.

        The Maria Mendonsa's crew gathers the boats once again shortly after the
                        morning's promising sunrise. The future of fishing in New England remains
                        uncertain. As regulations pile upon the fisheries in the few ports remaining
                        on the Eastern Seaboard, fishermen leave the work of generations to head
                        inland in hopes of earning a living with a more certain future. What we lose
                        as a society when they leave goes beyond the ability to buy fresh seafood
                        from local sources. While we can, for now at least, buy seafood farmed or
                        fished from countries located around our shrinking globe, there will come a
                        day when we can no longer afford to freight our dinners from a spot on the
                        ocean 6,000 miles distant. Beyond these considerations, however, is the loss
                        of yet another industry, another working culture, and the people who once
                        toiled to provide food for the rest. Over the past thirty years, our country
                        has shed these types of jobs and skills in a relentless quest for cheaper
                        products, and as we now begin to discover, without work to do ourselves, we
                        can no longer afford the products we now import. When a few large
                        corporations finally control the industry, the small businesses that each
                        boat represents will fade away, as will the jobs they provide. These are the
                        type of men and women who built our country: independent, hardworking, and
                        self-motivated, and we will all share in the loss when they no longer work
                        our coastlines.

        Janet circles her offshore trap during her last season as a working vessel.
                        Built in 1954 in Deltaville, Virginia, her previous owner attempted to sink
                        her off Block Island. Forgetting to empty two large fuel tanks, Janet
                        remained partially afloat and was towed back to shore. Ronnie Fatulie
                        purchased her and after she was rebuilt, the Janet went on to fish traps for
                        the Coast Canning Company for nearly 40 years. With opportunities fading in
                        a sea of regulations, young fishermen no longer see possibilities. They are
                        less and less the masters of their own fates, now subject to the bureaucracy
                        that oversees them. Despite the many hurdles, fishermen remain an optimistic
                        lot, and their enthusiasm for the work they do carries them through new
                        challenges. While lifelong fisherman Joe Whaley sometimes feels he won't
                        return to fishing, he nevertheless manages to leave the door open: "But
                        after you did what you wanted all your life, without being told what to do,
                        and all of a sudden somebody is trying to tell you what to do, where to go,
                        how to do it, who to sell it to, what you can catch, when you can go, when
                        you can come back, I said "Nope—you're not telling' me." But I'd love to go.
                        I might get back in yet, I don't know. I still keep my Rhode Island
                        permit...

        The crew from the Christine Roberta heads out to sea under tow in their
                        longboats for another day of fishing. Other fishing vessels in the harbor
                        include lobster boats and gill netters, although most of the harbor is now
                        filled with yachts, displacing fishermen from the waterfront.

        Drawing of a typical Rhode Island Floating Trap. Note: This diagram is not
                        to scale and does not include all anchors, floats, or weights used in the
                        full construction of such a trap. The traps pictured throughout this book
                        are known as floating traps, and while small differences in their
                        construction may exist between the companies deploying them, every trap
                        design is governed by the same general principle. Each is constructed around
                        what fishermen call the frame of the structure, and the trap's netting hangs
                        from this ridged form. The frame is formed by a series of anchors, lines,
                        and buoys. Construction begins with a leader line anchored to either the
                        shoreline or a breakwater. The leader may be as long as 1,500 feet,
                        depending on local conditions and the overall size of the trap itself. This
                        line is held on the surface of the ocean by a series of large floats, either
                        steel spheres or barrels, brightly painted to warn passing maritime traffic
                        of their location. The leader line stretches from the shore outward to the
                        first float, which is itself held in place by a pair of anchors stretched
                        perpendicular to the run of the leader. The cable proceeds to the next float
                        anchored in the same fashion, continuing on to other floats until reaching
                        the end of the leader some 1,500 feet later. The leader ends far from shore
                        at the wings of the trap. The wings, set at an angle to the direction of
                        both the leader and the trap itself, begin funneling fish into the
                        structure. Swimming along the leader and directed by the wings, fish are
                        then steered by the whiskers into the kitchen portion of the trap. A ramp
                        made of netting rises from the ocean floor at the far end of the kitchen and
                        leads them through the nozzle, the narrow entryway into the parlor. The
                        parlor is the actual trap portion of the structure, the section from which
                        fishermen will bail their catch. A rectangular box of netting up to 72' in
                        width and 90' in length, the parlor stretches from the ocean's surface to
                        the sea floor. Like the leader, these additional structures—the wings, the
                        kitchen, and the parlor—are constructed using the same techniques. Lines
                        running between anchored buoys trace each individual section across the
                        ocean's surface, held in place by up to twenty-six anchors set in opposition
                        to one another. Fishermen add rigidity to the framework by tensioning the
                        anchor lines at each large float. Once the frame has been constructed, the
                        netting, referred to as twine by fishermen, is ready to hang. The twine at
                        the ocean's surface is strung with floats to keep fish from escaping over
                        this edge. The bottom of the trap rests along the ocean's floor, held in
                        place with lead, iron, or concrete weights specifically cast for this
                        purpose. Once the entire frame is properly tensioned, fishermen hang twine
                        from it to create the wings, the kitchen, and the parlor. Crewmen then hang
                        twine from the leader line to complete the construction. As with the rest of
                        the structure, the leader's twine must reach the bottom to prevent fish from
                        merely swimming under. Because of this, the leader is tapered: narrow at the
                        shore end and deepening as it moves offshore towards the trap. Once the
                        twine is hung, the trap is left to soak—the fishermen's way of saying it has
                        begun to fish. Drawing by Markham Starr.

                     individuals in the photos were modified and used as titles. Sometimes
                     additional information from the longer inventory descriptions was recorded in
                     the item's Scope and Content note. All the descriptions were shortened from the

                        they did over ninety million dollars of business in 2008. Trawlers and
                        scallopers unload their catch at the waterfront facility where buyers can
                        inspect the fish before the sale. Fish and scallop auctions are now held
                        on-line and one hundred thousand pounds of scallops may be sold in five
                        minutes. Once purchased, refrigerated trucks haul the cargo away.

                        revolves around their lives and those left on shore waiting for their

                        off-load the vessel's fish when they return to port. The fish, stored iced

                        baskets which hold 250 pounds before being hoisted from the ship. Dwyer puts

                        he went on a few scalloping trips, he was primarily a draggerman fishing out
                        of both Boston and New Bedford. He was a longtime member of the New Bedford
                        Fisherman's Union.

        Eva Liput: Captain of F/V Quincy II, a 90' scallop boat. Coming to this
                        country from Poland as an art student in 1986, Liput went on to get her
                        master's degree in fine art at Boston University before becoming a deckhand
                        on a fishing vessel. She still pursues her art when time allows between the
                        ten to fifteen day scalloping trips she takes. With a crew of seven men, the
                        vessel brings back 18,000 pounds of scallops on a closed area trip, and more
                        on the longer open area voyages.

        Armando Estudante: His first visit to New Bedford in 1978 was because of his
                        interest in Herman Melville. After finding people from his home town in New
                        Bedford, he decided to emigrate to the US from Portugal where he ran a fleet
                        of vessels for a fishing company. Opportunities for an entrepreneur in the
                        US were greater than those in Portugal. Since he began fishing in this
                        country, he has owned four vessels, and now fishes for both groundfish and
                        scallops.

        Donald Clattenburg: Born in Port Midway, Nova Scotia, Donald Clattenburg
                        came to New Bedford in 1941. The son of a fishing captain, he started out
                        working in a fillet house and then served on LST 1014 in the Navy during
                        WWII. After the war he returned to fishing with both his father and his
                        uncle. In 1966, while aboard the F/V Venture, Clattenburg was caught in a
                        terrible storm and badly injured. He was rescued by the crew of a nearby
                        Russian factory trawler.

                        to this country, emigrating in 2006. She began working at American Pride
                        Seafoods performing many of the tasks associated with the creation of the

        Betsy Pye: While she was born and raised in New Bedford, she had, like many
                        others, no real connection to the town's major industry until she married a
                        fisherman. The life of a fisherman's wife is often quite different from that
                        of someone whose husband has a more typical nine to five job. To keep the
                        household running smoothly, she often takes up duties he might cover were he
                        home. Pye works at the New Bedford Ocean Explorium.

        Jeff Ferreira: As cars run on rubber tires, so do the majority of nets and

                        the bottom edges of nets and dredges, preventing wear and allowing the gear
                        to roll across the ocean floor. With over thirty employees, his business
                        recycles tens of thousands of tires a year, keeping them from landfills and
                        extending their useful lifespan.

        Laurie Botelho: Botelho's company, Diamond Marine, produces the cotton bags
                        used to store scallops aboard ships at sea. The material is cut and sewn
                        into bags which must hold a specific number of pounds of scallops. These
                        special bags allow the scallop meats to both breath and drain, creating the
                        highest quality product available. Coming from the food industry, Botelho's
                        long interest in food safety leads her to design a more bacterial resistant
                        product, assuring the highest prices for fishermen at auction.

      . He has described them into two subseries: technical films and general
                  audience films. The technical films are narrated by Starr. Starr uses moving
                  images and words to explain the technical processes of trap fishing. The general
                  audience films are narrated by interviewees and depict them at work. Films vary in
                  length from 2 minutes to 79 minutes. The film inventory "FILES.docx" features

        This five minute film was made for a fisherman to show to his child's school
                        classroom. It shows the boat going out, emptying a trap, returning to the
                        dock, and packing out the fish for shipment. Best film for a quick overview
                        of trap fishing. Filmed aboard the Maria Mendonsa. No narration.

        This shorter version was made from the longer version to show a general
                        audience. It follows the fishermen through their summer's work, but only
                        includes one boat fishing. Because of this, a lot of narration by the
                        fishermen in the longer version was also cut. Does not include removing gear
                        at the end of the season. Narrated by the fishermen themselves. The
                        fishermen's narration does not generally involve the technical aspects of
                        building and fishing a floating trap.

        This is the longest film and was made for the trap fishermen themselves. It
                        includes operations from nearly all of the summer's work, beginning with
                        spring preparations. It does not include footage of removing and storing the
                        gear at the end of the season. It is completely narrated by the fishermen
                        themselves, and shows all three boats fishing. As it is a bit long for a
                        general audience, a second and reduced version was made showing only one
                        boat fishing. The fishermen's narration does not generally involve the
                        technical aspects of building and fishing a floating trap, but rather, their
                        lives in fishing and comments on the industry in general.

        This film was shot from the deck of the Amelia Bucolo as crew members
                        installed the twine for the trap into the existing framework, previously
                        anchored into position. Narration by Markham Starr. This film was shot from
                        a distance so it is harder to see the finer details of installing a trap.
                        Other films covering the same operation make it easier to see.

        This humorous film is a two-minute version of "North Star Fishing the East
                        Wall Trap". It is essentially the same film run at high speed and was made
                        as a joke for Tom and his crew. No narration, set to music.

        This is the best footage of Tom and his crew installing a trap's twine into
                        an existing framework. This is probably the most complex part of the
                        process, and was filmed from the skiff carrying the twine. This video starts
                        with a 3D drawing of a trap in the water. Narrated by Markham Starr.

        This film covers Alan Wheeler and the crew of the Maria Mendonsa removing a
                        dirty trap from a frame for cleaning. About once a month, each trap and
                        leader is replaced with a clean and repaired version, as twine covered in
                        weeds fishes poorly and becomes too heavy for the crew to handle. The dirty
                        twine is brought to shore to dry out the weeds and to repair any holes or
                        other damage. Narrated by Markham Starr.

      Accrual is 8 sound recordings, 1 moving image, and 3 manuscripts. The sound
                  recordings are interviews with Rhode Island trap fishermen. Starr indicates that

       Stesha Cambell was one of only a handful of women working in the fishing
                     industry on the deck of a boat at the time of the recording. While she grew up
                     near the ocean's edge, she didn't come from a traditional fishing background.
                     The boat her brother was working on needed an extra hand, and she decided to
                     give it a try, and has been working as a commercial fisherman ever since.
                     Starting out on Tom Hoxsie's trap fishing boat, she then joined her brother in
                     starting an oyster farm in the bay above the harbor. A few years later, they
                     bought some of the floating fish traps from Tom and their own boat, and now
                     trap throughout the summer months along with the oystering. At home wherever
                     she lands, Stesha has blended into the fishing community and describes the
                     operations in which she is now involved and how she got into them in this
                     recording.

       Cory Wheeler Forest is one of Alan Wheeler's two children who work with him
                     operating a floating fish trap company in Sakonnett, Rhode Island. While not
                     interested in the operation until her teenage years, Cory became and avid
                     fisherman once she began going out on the boat as a deckhand. (Cory, like most
                     women who fish commercially, generally prefer to be called fishermen, not
                     fisherwomen.) She is a part owner of the company and works on all aspects of
                     the business: fishing, mending twine, and importantly, selling all that they
                     catch to markets in Boston, New York and other places. In this recording Cory
                     talks about her life in the industry and the problems they face in today's
                     world running an operation that has changed little in the past 100 years.

       As with most commercial fishermen in Point Judith, Tom comes from a fishing
                     family and grew up on the local waters. After high school, he tried working at
                     Electric Boat building submarines and in a local boatyard before realizing he
                     didn't want to work for others, and returned to fishing as a way to make a
                     living. The fishermen of Point Judith are nothing if not versatile, and Tom was
                     no exception, working in all types of fisheries before settling into the
                     trapping industry for most of his career. Tom has owned and operated a floating
                     trap company since the death of his brother in the early '80s, and began his
                     own oyster farm in the bay above the docks to keep himself on the water. Tom
                     describes his early and rough start into full-time commercial fishing, and the
                     reasons he works to provide food for others in this recording.

       James was awakened by his father at the age of 10 and told he was going
                     fishing, and he has made a living on the water ever since. Mostly fishing
                     offshore, he worked in nearly all types of fisheries. In his later years, he
                     became the captain of the Amelia Bucollo, a trap fishing boat out of Point
                     Judith, Rhode Island. Trap fishing is a great way for older fishermen to partly
                     retire from the long trips and grueling work of the offshore fisheries. The
                     season only covers the summer months, and the boat leaves the dock at 6 AM and
                     the day's work is usually over by mid to late morning. In this recording, James
                     talks about his life on the water and the fisheries in which he
                     participated.

       George Mendonsa is the sailor everyone has seen photos of but few know. Most
                     famously, he was the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt's photo for Life Magazine
                     taken in Times Square at the end of WWII of the sailor kissing the nurse. While
                     less famous nationally, George and his brothers were quite famous as the
                     floating trap fishermen of Rhode Island. After immigrating to the US at the
                     beginning of the 20th century, George and his family grew up on a small island
                     off of Newport, Rhode Island. His father was the captain of a small floating

       Joe Whaley's father was born in the Point Judith lighthouse, and Joe spent his
                     entire life on the water in the commercial fishing industry. He began when
                     small, wooden boats were the standard in the Port of Point Judith, Rhode
                     Island, and saw the many changes that overtook the port as it grew into the 9th
                     largest fishing port in America. For much of his career, he fished with his
                     wife Midge as his deckhand, an unusual arrangement in a male dominated
                     industry. Typical of most Point Jude fishermen, Joe worked in a variety of
                     fisheries throughout his life, and also worked for AT&amp;T at sea protecting
                     trans-Atlantic cables when broken or as they were installed, keeping fishing
                     vessels away from the ongoing work. In this recording Joe describes his life at
                     sea and the governmental changes that caused him to quit.

       Alan Wheeler is a second generation fisherman working out of Sakonnett Point,
                     Rhode Island. His father began trucking vegetables and eventually fish off
                     Aquidneck Island before buying a fish trap company. He and two of his children
                     still operate a Rhode Island style floating fish trap, one of only three
                     companies still utilizing this ancient technology. Alan has also worked in
                     numerous other fisheries, such as lobstering, gillnetting, and longlining. In
                     this recording Alan talks about his life in fishing and the operation of the
                     fish traps they still work.

       Luke is Alan Wheeler's oldest son, and has been an avid commercial fisherman
                     since he was a child. He began by fishing with his father, lobstering from a
                     skiff and eventually going out on the trap boat. Today he also owns and
                     operates the Shirley Ann, a gillnetter out of Sakonnet Point, Rhode Island, as
                     well as working with his sister and father to run the floating trap company
                     they own amongst themselves. In this recording Luke talks about his upbringing
                     on the water and his path through the Merchant Marine Academy and back onto the
                     decks of fishing vessels. He also describes how a floating fish trap works.

      Accrual is 29 moving images and 1 manuscript. The films were shot and edited by
                  Starr. 28 of them concern fishing and one concerns dairy farming. The films vary
                  in length from four minutes to one hour and fifteen minutes. The independent films
                  were not created in association with any of Starr's broader documentary projects,
                  but they do compliment those works. The fishing films primarily profile individual
                  fishermen or small businesses, while a few concern the northeastern fishing
                  industry more broadly. The dairy film is a profile of Clark Woodmansee, a Preston,
                  Connecticut, farmer. Some of the films are derivative versions of others - for
                  example, a shorter cut intended for a different audience. The films are undated
                  but appear to have been shot circa 2010-2019. The manuscript is Starr's film
                  inventory, which includes his descriptions for all the films.

      The films and document are stored in one folder. Files are described in
                  alphabetical order (aside from the film inventory, which is listed first).
                  Archivists repurposed Starr's descriptions in the film inventory into titles and

                     of the port. In this version Jay Gallup discusses the company history and what
                     they do over scenes of the work being done at the business.

       A quick video of a trip to empty floating trap sites at Point Judith, RI. Ian
                     and his sister Stesha Campbell bought some of Tom Hoxsie's trap sites as Tom
                     became seriously ill with cancer and Ian did not want to see these historic
                     sites disappear forever. This film has no narration.

       Wayne has been employed for most of his working life as a lumper in Point
                     Judith. Lumpers unload fish from ships docked in the port, removing as much as

                     unloading the catch in the hold of the trawler Hopefull.
