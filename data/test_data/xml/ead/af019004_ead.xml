    The Maggie Holtzberg collection
            documents, through interviews and photographs, the occupational folklife and craft of
            hot metal typesetters, compositors, and printers. Holtzberg interviewed skilled
            craftsmen and women who experienced the disruptive technology and transition in the
            printing industry from mechanical typesetting, "hot metal," to computer-aided
            photocomposition or "cold type." She interviewed retired printers residing at the Union
            Printers Home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and craft printers at Heritage Printers in
            Charlotte, North Carolina, among others. Interviews were conducted between 1983-1988.
            The collection includes the production files for Holtzberg's book, The Lost World
               of the Craft Printer (University of Illinois Press, 1992); correspondence
            with folklorists Archie Green and Judith McCulloh, and notes from meetings with
            Holtzberg's dissertation advisors at the University of Pennsylvania -- Henry Glassie,
            Ray Birdwhistell, and with Ken Goldstein, whom she interviewed about his experience in
            the printing industry. The collection also includes two journals written while Maggie
            Holtzberg was a student from 1972-1973 at the Trailside Country School, based in
            Killington, Vermont. The Trailside Country School was a traveling high school run by
            Michael Cohen and Diana Cohen that taught cultural documentation. The notebooks include
            diary entries, song lyrics, music transcription, and ephemera from locations throughout
            the United States where the students traveled. Photographs include the 46 illustrations
            for Holtzberg's book, 31 slides, plus snapshots from Holtzberg's fieldwork with printers
            and a few from the Trailside Country School. One of the interviews with printers was
            conducted by folklorist Jan Rosenberg.

    Arrangement
   </head>
   <p>
    The collection is arranged into two series: 1: Interviews; 2: Manuscripts,
               correspondence, and production files.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series 1: The Interviews series consists of a few folders at the series level and
               19 subseries arranged alphabetically. The "Union Printers Home" subseries is divided
               into eight further subseries, arranged in their original chronological order. The
               records for the "Interviews" series were originally organized in roughly
               chronological order, and stored together in a three ring binder, except for the
               records in the "Union Printers Home" subseries. Those papers were originally
               organized in loose folders. The order of items within all folders have been
               retained.
   </p>
   <p>
    Series 2: The Manuscripts, correspondence, and production files series consists of
               folders and two subseries, "The Lost World of the Craft Printer" and "Trailside
               Country School," arranged alphabetically. The records in this series were originally
               in unordered folders, except for the two "Dissertation Research" folders, which were
               collected in one 3-ring binder. The original order of items and the folders titles
               (where they existed) have been retained.

   <p>
    The Maggie Holtzberg collection documents, through interviews and photographs, the
            occupational folklife and craft of hot metal typesetters, compositors, and printers.
            Holtzberg interviewed skilled craftsmen and women who experienced the disruptive
            technology and transition in the printing industry from mechanical typesetting, "hot
            metal," to computer-aided photocomposition or "cold type." She interviewed retired
            printers residing at the Union Printers Home in Colorado Springs, Colorado and craft
            printers at Heritage Printers in Charlotte, North Carolina, among others. Interviews
            were conducted between 1983-1988. The collection includes the production files for
            Holtzberg's book,
    <title>

      The Lost World of the Craft Printer
     </part>
    </title>
    (University of
            Illinois Press, 1992); correspondence with folklorists Archie Green and Judith McCulloh,
            and notes from meetings with Holtzberg's dissertation advisors at the University of
            Pennsylvania -- Henry Glassie, Ray Birdwhistle, and with Ken Goldstein, whom she
            interviewed about his experience in the printing industry. The collection also includes
            two journals written while Maggie Holtzberg was a student from 1972-1973 at the
            Trailside Country School, based in Killington, Vermont. The Trailside Country School was
            a traveling high school run by Michael Cohen and Diana Cohen that taught cultural
            documentation. The notebooks include diary entries, song lyrics, music transcription,
            and ephemera from locations throughout the United States where the students traveled.
            Photographs include the 46 illustrations for Holtzberg's book, 31 slides, plus snapshots
            from Holtzberg's fieldwork with printers and a few from the Trailside Country School.
            One of the interviews with printers was conducted by folklorist Jan Rosenberg.

      Interviews with craftsmen concerning their experiences in the printing industry,
                  typically regarding the shift from "hot metal" mechanical typesetting to
                  "cold-type" computer-aided photocomposition. Earlier interviews were conducted as
                  part of Holtzberg's dissertation research, and those created after 1987 were
                  conducted as part of her monograph

                  wrote notes and summaries. Some recorded interviews do not have full

       John Spencer Co. was a print shop that had been in business since 1864. When
                     the company closed, Holtzberg attended the auction of its assets. Included are
                     public notices of the auction, Holtzberg's notes, photographs, and recordings
                     of the event, and one printing industry journal article reporting on the
                     event.

      Series primarily contains records, manuscripts, and research materials created or
                  collected by Holtzberg related to her study of "hot metal" typesetting during her
                  PhD research in folklore and folklife and the publication of her manuscript "The
                  Lost World of the Craft Printer." The major subseries is "The Lost World of the
                  Craft Printer," which contains production files and correspondence with the
                  University of Illinois Press concerning the editing and publication of that book.
                  A unique subseries otherwise unrelated to the other records in the collection is
                  Holtzberg's journals from her time as a high school student at the Trailside
                  Country School in 1972-1973.

       Two journals written while Maggie Holtzberg was a student at the Trailside
                     Country School, based in Killington, Vermont. The Trailside Country School was
                     a traveling high school run by Michael Cohen and Diana Cohen that taught
                     cultural documentation. The notebooks include diary entries, song lyrics, music
                     transcription, and ephemera from locations throughout the United States where
                     the students traveled.
