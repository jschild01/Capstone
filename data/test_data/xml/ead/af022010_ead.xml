    Processing History

   <p>
    Physical materials in the Neil V. Rosenberg bluegrass music collection were processed
                by Maya Lerman and Marcia K. Segal between 2013-2022.

   <p>
    Digital content from DVDs was ripped by AFC staff in 2013 and the carriers
                deaccessioned. Files from the DVDs and a separate file transfer were processed by
                Farrah Cundiff in 2024 into an archival information package (AIP): afc2002009_dc001.
                Derivatives created by the donor were retained. System files were removed. Some
                content which corresponded to physical source recordings in the

     Neil V. Rosenberg
    </head>
    <p>
     Neil V. Rosenberg (born 1939, in Seattle, Washington), grew up in Olympia,
               Washington, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Berkeley, California. From age seven he
               studied violin, and later studied guitar and voice. His studies at Oberlin
               College (where he earned a B.A. in history) overlapped with his time as
               co-founder of the Redwood Canyon Ramblers. After graduation from Oberlin he
               attended Indiana University (where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
               folklore). Throughout this time he remained active as a musician and, with the
               banjo as his primary musical instrument, he played at the Brown County Jamboree
               in the early 1960s. His writing career from the mid-1960s has focused on
               bluegrass music history, and he has written critically acclaimed books including
     <title>

      <part>
       Bluegrass Generation: A Memoir
      </part>
     </title>
     (2018), as well as album liner notes and scholarly articles. His
               teaching career includes work at Indiana University (1966-1968) and Memorial
               University of Newfoundland (1968-2004). In Canada, as in the U.S., Rosenberg
               developed, founded, and mentored various musical endeavors: co-founder of the
               bluegrass band Crooked Stovepipe; host of a weekly bluegrass music show
               (broadcast on radio station CKIX-FM (St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador,
               Canada); and numerous other achievements that served to draw and maintain a
               lively interest in the genre and history of bluegrass music. In 2014, he was
               inducted into the Bluegrass Hall of Fame.

      Neil Rosenberg collected sound recordings for his own research, building a
                        reference library of live recordings and studio recordings (including dubs
                        of commercial recordings). Some of the recordings were sent to him as a gift
                        or by request; the sources are noted if known.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brian Miksis digitized selected sound recordings and documentation, making
                  high-resolution and lower-resolution surrogates. See
      <ref target="ref_id17244">
       Digital surrogates of selected recordings in Series 3
      </ref>
      . Song lists and
                  production notes listed below are his own, compiled from his own research,
                  observations while digitizing the recordings, and guidance from Neil Rosenberg,
                  especially when the pitch needed adjustment to restore the audio quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The archivist used a combination of Rosenberg's detailed inventories and
                        information on tape boxes to create a list of contents per recording, and
                        made additions and corrections based on further research. In addition,
                        Rosenberg provided subsequent edits to the information. The documentation
                        includes the names of those people who gave him tapes, identified in this
                        finding aid as the "source." According to Rosenberg's documentation, items
                        assigned the IDs SR256, SR268, and SR278 were deaccessioned from his
                        collection prior to its arrival at AFC. He also noted that the ID SR262 was
                        inadvertently not assigned to any recording, and the recording with the ID
                        SR024 was loaned to someone but not returned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The original inventory includes tapes numbered 12-15, 106, 281-290. These are
                        part of the

        According to Rosenberg, this tape is a compilation of dubs of tapes
                                from his collection and tapes in the collections of other
                                people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tracks from the hoot were dubbed from an original set of two
                                tapes. The recordist Nancy Decker made multiple copies, and made
                                copies to order.

        Lorain County String Band personnel (for the spring 1959 Oberlin Hoot
                                recording): Neil Rosenberg, Mayne Smith, Chuck Crawford, John
                                Schuler, Frank Miller, Phil Specht. According to Rosenberg the
                                line-up may have been Mayne, banjo; John, bass; Neil, mandolin; Phil
                                Specht, string bass; Frank and Charles, guitar. The tape source is
                                unknown.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lorain County Strig Band demo was recorded in Oberlin, Ohio, at
                                WOBC radio studio (the garage of Grey Gables). Engineers: Billy
                                Crawford and Jerry Jentsch. This tape was dubbed from the 15 ips
                                original. The first track may not be complete.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recording of the Plum Creek Boys begins with a remnant of a
                                previous recording on the tape that was not erased or taped over, in
                                error. A sermon can be heard on occasion as well (from the
                                incomplete erasure).

        Dubs of a concert ("hoot") presented by the Oberlin Folk Song Club,
                                Oberlin, Ohio, held in Wilder Hall Auditorium. Ann Milovsoroff
                                (Rosenberg's wife from 1961-1988) ordered her copy of the concert,
                                and requested that Nancy omit 12 numbers, so these tapes hold only
                                36 of the original 48 numbers. Continued on

                            Decker's order form, filled out by "A.M." From 00:23:24 to the end of
                            the tape there is a remnant of classical music performance, from a
                            previous recording incompletely erased or recorded over. Other instances
                            of previous recordings still on the tape can be heard occasionally.

                                    Monroe show over a segment of the Stanley Brothers show (on his
                                    copy of the tape). Since he had taped the Stanley Brothers
                                    concert for the Indiana University Folksong Club and deposited
                                    the original recordings at the IU Archives of Traditional Music,
                                    the complete Stanley Brothers concert can be found there (ATM

         From Sweden. Haglund brothers (Urban and Mats) made up the
                                    Tennessee Travelers. When their brother Thomas joined the group
                                    they were the Midnight Cowboys. Rosenberg identifies the group
                                    as the Tennessee Travelers. Personnel: Urban, guitar; Mats,
                                    banjo; Thomas, fiddle; and another unidentified musician dubbed
                                    in.

                                added to the Redwood Canyon Ramblers collection (as AFC 2011/011:
                                SR10). This is the reason why SR106 does not otherwise appear in
