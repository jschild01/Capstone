Emilye Crosby: Alright. I’m Emilye Crosby with the Southern Oral History Program at 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And I’m conducting this oral history as part of 
the Civil Rights History Project, an undertaking of the Smithsonian Institution’s National 
Museum of African American History and Culture and the American Folklife Center in the 
Library of Congress. Today is May twenty-eighth, [2013], and we are here with Mrs. Linda 
Fuller Degelmann at her home in Americus, Georgia. And I’m here also with John Bishop, and 
we are really pleased to be with you today. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann: Well, thank you, Emilye. It’s a pleasure to be here with you and 
John. 
EC: Great. I was wondering if you could start by telling us a little bit about your family 
and background growing up in Alabama. Is that correct?

LD: I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1941, and that happened to be the 
phenomenal year when the atom bomb was used in Japan. So, of course, I was unaware of that at 
that time. But my father is a businessman, graduated from the University of Alabama, thought 
that it would be good for him to become active in the Army. I think actually that was the—those 
were the days when reserve units were called into active duty. And he didn’t go overseas, but he 
was assigned to the procurement office with the Army in Philadelphia. So, when I was still a 
toddler, we moved to Philadelphia for a couple of years. 
When the war was over, we moved back to Alabama and settled in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
And that’s where I was raised until I married in 1959. 
EC: Did your father continue to work in business? 
LD: He did. After the war, he and my mother started a business in downtown Tuscaloosa 
called Caldwell Electric Company. It’s right on Broad Street, and so I became very familiar with 
all kinds of appliances. I think we were the first ones in town, in the city, to have a dishwasher. 
EC: Wow! 
LD: [Laughs] 
EC: That’s memorable. 
LD: And maybe one of the first televisions, you know, with the big antennas on top of 
our house. So, they were very engaged in business while I was growing up in school. I have one 
older sister. 
And one thing that I—was real sharp in my memory about my dad’s business, related to 
the Southern culture at that time, was he had a repair shop down in the basement of the store. 
And one of the guys was a black man, and I think he was mostly involved in delivering 
appliances that were sold. My dad would have—my dad and mom would have an annual picnic, 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
3 
 
cookout at their house every year, and he never would be invited. And, you know, I remember 
wondering about that, you know, “Why was not he included?” 
And, of course, I went to segregated school. And there was just no question about 
whether they should be integrated. You know, it was just the way things were. Being a university 
town, I think, the University of Alabama, I think we were exposed to more integrated situations, 
although it was after I married, that the university was actually integrated. 
EC: Really? Yeah. Do you—you said you remember wondering why this one employee 
wasn’t ever invited or wasn’t at the picnic. Did you ever ask your parents? Or do you know why 
you thought about that? 
LD: I think I did bring it up, but it was just sort of dismissed. 
EC: Um-hmm. 
LD: I don’t remember a specific answer. 
EC: Yeah. Do you remember—I mean, other than that, which is really interesting, do you 
remember sort of when you first began to think about race and sort of understand [0:05:00] the 
separation and the hierarchies that existed? 
LD: Well, actually I think it was after I married. I married—like I said, I married in 1959. 
And my husband, Millard, had been very active in youth work in his church. And often there 
would be like a conference, a youth conference, up in the North somewhere. And when he would 
go up there, he became aware of some differences. Specifically, he remembered being greeted by 
a black woman, you know, and he thought, “Wow! [Laughs] That was pretty interesting,” you 
know. So, he was at the conference with black people, and he had a different perspective, outside 
of his upbringing, which was on the Georgia-Alabama border around West Point, Georgia. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013

So, he became aware of some transitions that were taking place. And so, I picked up an 
awareness from him. And we talked about, you know, how things were segregated, and we tried 
to reach out to black people whenever we had an opportunity to. And I began to realize, “Hey, 
they’re just people like me,” but it was mostly in a church setting. 
EC: I’ve got a couple of questions about that. So, do you remember things like the Brown 
decision, or the Montgomery bus boycott? I guess you would have been in, like, high school or 
maybe even a little younger for those. 
LD: You know, right after Millard and I married, we moved to Montgomery. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: And he and a fellow law student had gone in business while they were in law school, 
and they set up a law practice in Montgomery. I attended Huntington College, which was, I 
think, all-white at that time. But then, things were occurring, like the bus boycott. Because while 
I was in school, I also had children and I needed someone to come to the house to keep the 
children. And so, I always had to go into town to pick up the lady. 
EC: Oh, really? 
LD: Of course it was the buses. She wouldn’t ride the bus. And it was an inconvenience, 
but yet, here again, I just accepted it as the way things were. 
EC: As part of how that worked. 
LD: Yeah. And then, there was the Selma to Montgomery march. Actually, let me back 
up. The next conflict in Montgomery were the Freedom Rides. And Millard and Morris Dees 
actually went down to the bus station out of curiosity, just to see what would happen when some 
of those buses came in. And they were shocked at how people were beat up as soon as they 
stepped off the bus. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
5 
 
EC: So, they were there that first day, that day they had that big—? 
LD: Well, yeah, there may have been several— 
EC: I’m sure there were. 
LD: Different Freedom Rides that came into Montgomery. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: But this particular one, I can remember how they were just shocked at how brutally 
people were beat up. And they began to think, “Hey, this is—something is wrong with this 
picture here! This is terrible!” You know, both of them grew up in the church and, you know, 
they knew about brotherly love. And times were already beginning to change, with thoughts of 
equality and justice and that kind of thing. 
But what they witnessed just made them—their minds shift a hundred and eighty degrees. 
And whereas they had been sort of part of the Klan—they had been in politics in law school and 
had spoken on behalf of the man running for lieutenant governor, and they went to Klan rallies to 
speak on behalf of McDonald Gallion. They never were members of the Klan, but they were 
actually [0:10:00] sort of members on the side, because they received the issues of what was 
called The Fiery Cross. That was a publication. I don’t know how widespread it was. It may have 
been just the Alabama Klan that published it. But in fact, they had represented a man that—I’ve 
forgotten exactly what the case was, but they had represented a member of the Klan for some 
kind of legal action. And they called him into their office. Apparently he was one of the leaders. 
And they told him that they wanted to cancel their subscription to The Fiery Cross. [Laughs] 
And Morris took a pistol out and put it on his desk when he said it, “We want to cancel our 
subscription to The Fiery Cross.” 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013

And it was just a few nights later when their offices, Fuller and Dees Marketing, was 
broken into and a lot of typewriters smashed, you know, paint slung on the wall, and some vile 
language, you know, sprayed on the wall. And so, they began to get repercussions and learn that, 
you know, this was not a very popular thing to do, but they knew it was right. 
EC: How did you feel about it? You know, as they’re going through this change, it must 
have an impact on you? 
LD: Oh, yeah. Well, I didn’t see the beatings that occurred from the Freedom Ride. But, 
of course, I heard them talk about it. And I thought myself, “This isn’t right.” 
And then, there was the Selma to Montgomery march. Some pastors that Millard knew up 
in Ohio, Indiana—I forgot now where they were from—came down to participate, and they 
didn’t have a place to stay. And they got in touch with Millard and said, “Hey, you know, can we 
put our bedroll down on your living room floor and have a place to sleep at night?” And, of 
course, Millard said, “Sure!” And our neighbors found out about it, [laughs] and we got some 
pretty nasty phone call. 
But not only did the marchers—there were four or five or six of them—would stay at our 
house, but Millard and Morris would take them back to the march route each morning. And they 
can remember their license plate, you know, the photograph of their license plate, and thus we 
got some additional nasty calls, you know, from the broader community. 
So, they made a stand, and it wasn’t real significant. We never participated in any 
marches ourselves, but we definitely began to observe, began to see, you know, that times were 
changing and needed to change. And we just felt so badly for people who were discriminated 
against and we decided, you know, somehow or another, we needed to get [13:59] side. [Laughs] 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
7 
 
EC: How did that affect your sort of social life, your church life in Montgomery while 
you’re still living there and while you’re sort of rethinking? 
LD: Well, our neighbors wouldn’t speak to us ever again. We actually left. Millard and I 
left Montgomery in 1965. This is a whole other story about our marriage crisis. Millard and 
Morris both wanted to become millionaires by age thirty. And that was requiring them to work 
night and day, night and day, and it basically just destroyed our marriage. I left Millard. And out 
of that marriage crisis, we felt called to give away all of our wealth and basically start totally 
over again. And we said, “We want God to be in control this time. We’ve been doing what we 
want to do. We want God [0:15:00] to be in control.” 
So, this was mid-sixties, and Millard had a lot of energy. [Birds sing] He didn’t want to 
just sit around, you know. So, the pastor that I counseled with at Broadway United Church of 
Christ in New York City, Dr. Durgin, was on the board of Tougaloo College, a predominantly or 
totally black college then in Mississippi. And Millard asked him, you know, “Do you have any 
ideas on what we could do, now that I’ve left business, sold my interest, half-interest to my 
partner, Morris Dees,” who, by the way, started Southern Poverty Law Center. 
EC: Um-hmm, yeah. 
LD: That was five or six years later. He continued Fuller and Dees Marketing for a 
number of years before he started Southern Poverty Law Center. And so, Dr. Durgin said, “Well, 
I’m on the board for Tougaloo, and we so badly need a new dorm.” He said, “How would you 
like to raise the money for this new dorm on campus?” Millard said, “Okay!” You know, “I 
know how to make money. I know how to raise money.” So, he said, “Okay.” [Laughs] 
EC: Was that a volunteer job then? 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
8 
 
LD: Well, actually, it was, because we kept a little bit of money to live on. I think he got 
a little bit of a salary, you know. We had three kids by that time, and we actually planted 
ourselves in the New York City area. 
EC: Okay, I wondered. 
LD: And Dr. Durgin provided an office for Millard to work out of, because, I mean, we 
couldn’t come back to Montgomery to raise money. The money was in the North. [Laughs] And 
so, he needed that environment to raise that significant money. And we actually settled our 
family in New Jersey for two years. 
EC: That must have been a change for you. 
LD: Well, it was, but I’m the type of person that I don’t mind a challenge, and it was a 
whole new exciting chapter in our lives. [Birds sing] We had become so miserable with so much 
wealth and stuff and the failing of our marriage that we wanted to get back to basics. He and I 
both had a simple, middle-class upbringing. And it felt good to get kind of back to the basics and 
be focused on something bigger than ourselves, something with meaning, something that would 
put our Christian faith into action. 
EC: When you were living in New Jersey, what was the racial dynamics like there at that 
time, in the community that you were part of? 
[Birds continue to sing periodically] 
LD: Well, as best as I can remember, in Montclair and the Glen Ridge area, it was 
predominantly white. I think it was because of the economy. It was sort of a wealthy bedroom 
suburb. We lived in—we rented the bottom floor of a house, so we didn’t live in one of the really 
nice houses in that area. But Millard commuted into the city by bus every day. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
9 
 
Our oldest child, son Chris, went to first grade there, and it seemed like there were two or 
three black children in the class. There didn’t seem to be any racial discrimination, as far as 
housing was concerned. It was more an affordability issue, I think, for most black families in the 
area. Of course, Newark was close by, but that was another county. So, the population of the 
schools would probably have been integrated but predominantly black there. But by that time, 
you know, we had become very comfortable around black people, even sought out friendships 
with black families. So, it was a different environment from being in the South, for sure. 
[0:20:00] 
EC: Yeah. I was wondering if, with the Freedom Rides, when you were talking about 
your husband and Morris Dees going and looking at that, you know, and seeing that violence, 
and the impact it had, and their previous affiliation with the Klan. I guess a couple of questions. 
Do you remember what—you know, were they sympathetic to the Klan? Or was this a practical 
kind of political affiliation? I mean, I know you said they weren’t exactly members but, you 
know, going and speaking. Do you remember how they felt about it before they began to 
question? 
LD: Well, it was just like there’s the Lions Club or the Kiwanis Club, you know. Their 
activities were different. But they weren’t really a part of the meetings, other than back in law 
school in the late fifties, you know, going to speak. 
EC: It was sort of a political alliance kind of thing? 
LD: Well. 
EC: It was just part of the structure? 
LD: Yeah, they kind of accepted it, you know. I guess they thought they were a little 
radical, you know. [Laughs] 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
10 
 
EC: But so it is, right? One of the pieces of background information I got mentioned that 
their law firm defended some of the white men involved in the attacks on the Freedom Riders. 
Does that—do you remember anything about that? 
LD: You know, that—no, I don’t. 
EC: I was wondering if that was the person that they were having that interaction with 
around The Fiery Cross or—? 
LD: It could have been, but I’m not sure. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: I may have it in some notes somewhere. I wish Millard were here, because he could 
have told you every little detail of that. 
EC: He had that kind of memory? 
LD: Yes, definitely. 
EC: Yeah. What was Huntington like during that period? I think Bob Zellner, one of the 
student activists, graduated from Huntington in the late fifties. And he talks about—or maybe it 
was even earlier—but he talks about taking a sociology class, and they ended up doing some 
firsthand research that involved going to meet Dr. King, and some of them got kicked out of 
school. But in some ways, it was also a good environment for him, at least. So, I wonder what it 
was like for you to be attending Huntington at that time and what the atmosphere was like. 
LD: I don’t remember any kind of activity like that. I was married and living at home. I 
wasn’t real active on campus, as if I would have been had I lived in a dorm. I was there, 
beginning 1961 through ’66, and it could have happened either before or after. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
11 
 
EC: He would have been there before you were there. But I just was curious, you know, 
whether any of your professors talked about race at all, or if that was just sort of outside of that 
experience? 
LD: No, it was—the Christian emphasis was still pretty strong at the college. Some 
colleges and universities had started off with firmer Christian association; it was still—I 
remember Old and New Testament were required for every freshman entering, ethics and 
philosophy were required. And that really broadened my mind a whole lot, the ethics and 
philosophy, because it examined values in every aspect of life, so that you could kind of 
objectively look at yourself, your environment and decide, you know, what is valuable. 
Well, I’m trying to think. I don’t remember any black students there. I don’t know that 
they would have been excluded had they applied. It was pretty expensive. I only got to go there 
because Millard was financing my education, and he was able to do that. But here, again, as far 
as the housing is concerned, it might have been—it was probably just not affordable, or black 
students may not have felt comfortable. But I know after I left, in the seventies or eighties, there 
was a real effort to recruit [0:25:00] to bring a more diverse student population to Huntington. 
And, of course, I think that exists today. 
EC: Um-hmm, yeah, I’m sure. 
John Bishop: Can we pause just a minute? 
LD: Okay. 
[Recording stops and then continues] 
JB: Okay, we’re back again. 
EC: I imagine you must have been pretty busy with the small children and going to 
school. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
12 
 
LD: [Gasps] Yes. My parents had really implanted in my mind and my sister’s mind that 
we should strive to get at least our undergraduate degree. And, in fact, I married when I was 
eighteen. And I promised my parents that, if I married at that young age, that I would continue. I 
would go to school. Well, [laughs] we had our first baby eleven months after we married. 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: So, when he was ten months old, that’s when we moved to Montgomery, and I 
enrolled in Huntington. At first, I just went part time, and I started figuring up, “Gee, it’s going 
to take me ten or twelve years to finish!” I said, “If I’m away from home and I have help with the 
children and the housework,” I said, “I might as well go full time.” So, I did and I finished in five 
years. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: Yeah! Whoo! I remember the time when the marchers were staying in our house, I 
felt kind of bad, because we didn’t know when they would be getting in at night, I left them on 
their own to prepare their food, and I thought, “Oh, my goodness!” You know, “Why wasn’t I 
more hospitable?” But, you know, I had exams, I had kids. [Laughs] I don’t know, I was young, 
very young, in my early twenties, and I just thought we were providing a floor for them to sleep 
on, you know. I didn’t know we were feeding the army, you know. But anyway, it was an 
interesting experience. 
EC: Did you have a sense of the historical significance of the event at the time? The 
Selma to Montgomery March and then the Voting Rights Act? 
LD: You know, not having been actually physically, emotionally involved, I don’t know 
that I understood the significance of it until after we left Montgomery, until later when I became 
aware of more and more activities. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
13 
 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: But, you know, Dr. King was jailed right here in Americus, Georgia. And they—he 
was like a hot potato, you know. They quickly got him down to forty miles south of here and put 
him in Albany jail. 
EC: Oh, was that during the Albany protests? So, that’s where he was brought during the 
Albany Movement protest, I think, probably. In December of ’61, there were a lot of arrests in 
Albany, and they moved people out to all the different counties. 
LD: Could have been. 
JB: [28:27] from here down to Albany. Is that what you said? 
LD: I thought I understood that was the case. 
JB: That’s what you said, yeah. 
LD: Uh-huh. You know, I wasn’t here. This is just what I’ve heard. I’ve got people that 
we could check with to make sure. 
EC: Yeah. Well, there were also protests—SCLC was back involved in Americus, I 
think, in ’65, maybe, I’m not sure.  So— 
LD: We didn’t learn—we didn’t visit Koinonia Farm, that had suffered a lot because of 
their activity as far as being very sympathetic to blacks in the area of—they hated that there was 
so much poverty and injustice, and the way that blacks were treated, and so they befriended 
blacks. They always ate together the main meal, and they were all kind of treated on the same 
social level, and that’s what got the local people so agitated. [Laughs] But that was pretty much 
over by the time we moved here. 
After Millard raised the money to build that dormitory at Tougaloo College, we felt 
called to come back South and move to Koinonia to work with Clarence Jordan and the other 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
14 
 
people that were there. And the violence had [0:30:00] subsided. It’s a fascinating history that 
[sighs] I wish we had time to go into. But, as I mentioned, there’s an excellent documentary, 
hour-long documentary that our daughter made. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: And was aired on public television all over the country, Briars in the Cotton Patch, 
so that pretty much tells that story. But as, you know, we had four kids. We were starting to build 
houses. We had partnership farming. We had partnership industries. I was pretty much stretched 
just to live at Koinonia and be a part of the things that would actually help the black people and 
society there. 
JB: But that’s part of what happened [31:00] Maybe you give a brief summary of what 
[31:12], a short [31:15] [Laughs] 
LD: [Laughs] Okay, basically, when we moved there, we got to know a lot of families 
that were living in shacks. Koinonia had befriended these people over the years and helped them 
out in various ways, but the housing was just so strikingly poor. And a lot of these houses were 
on the farms of the—and, you know, part of the whole system of the—[laughs] well, my mind’s 
blanking. 
EC: Sharecropping. 
LD: [Laughs] The sharecropper system. Thank you. Yeah, and so, we would visit some 
of these shacks, and there were big holes in the roofs, holes in the floors, newspapers had been 
tacked up on the walls to insulate as best they could, windows had been broken out, and, of 
course, there was no attempt by the farmer to fix the houses. But we had some property at 
Koinonia, and we said, “Well, why don’t we start what we call a partnership housing 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
15 
 
movement?” We’re in partnership with the people that need the help. We’re in partnership with 
God, who has given us the direction to help our brothers and sisters in need. 
And since blacks could not go to the bank to get loans to buy a house or even buy land, 
we thought, “Well, we’ll just dedicate some of the land here,” the two thousand and something 
acres at Koinonia, and start building houses, sell them to the families, no profit, no interest. That 
was the only way the families could afford it. And they were simple houses, like the ones that we 
started off building were cinderblock. But, for the first time, families had an indoor bathroom, 
running water, things we just take for granted—closets, kitchen cabinets! You know? Wow! We 
saw it make such a difference in the families. 
The Johnson family was the first family to move into one of the houses. And then, there 
were families after families that moved in. I remember we kind of hit a point where there were 
about ten houses—ten families moved in. And there were little kids running all over the 
neighborhood! You know, we got to—we had a little playground for them, and a lot of them 
didn’t even know what their names were. Their grandmamas were taking care of them. And so, 
since my degree was in elementary education, we set up a child development center there. 
So, one thing kind of just led to another. And then, we noticed that blacks didn’t have—
they were either unemployed or underemployed. So, we started partnership industries. Not only 
did we have the pecan plant and growing peanuts and corn, but we started a sewing industry and 
a pottery, so that we could give employment to people that [34:56] low income. [Clears throat] 
[0:35:00] 
That’s pretty much it in a nutshell. We lived at Koinonia for five years to develop these 
types of things. But the thing that really interested us the most was the housing component. 
That’s what really seemed to make a difference in the lives of poor black people. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
16 
 
EC: Did your idea about that develop through the experience with all these programs? I 
mean, also you’re doing the housing and the child development and the economic development, 
and so, out of all of that, out of that experience, then you focused in on the housing? 
LD: On the housing. And we became interested in seeing if that same philosophy, those 
same principles would work outside the U.S. We moved to Africa. We took our whole family to 
Africa for three years and pioneered the work there. Same thing, no profit, no interest, long term 
to pay, twenty years to pay. And it worked there! 
We came home after building about a hundred and twenty houses, and it took us about a 
year and a half [laughs] to get the concrete block factory running, and, you know, the first house 
built, but it was a tremendous success. And when we came home—see, we’d been raising 
support from churches, individuals. Koinonia put some money into it. Companies like Lilly, you 
know, had given us a grant to buy concrete. 
And so, when we came back home, we thought, “Gee, you know, this ought to be a—
probably work most anywhere in the world where there’s poverty.” And we came back with the 
thought that we would start a worldwide ministry right at Koinonia. But things had changed a 
little bit, the leadership, and they said, “No, we just want to build houses right here in Sumter 
County. We don’t want to do this whole big worldwide thing.” So, we—they gave us part of a 
chicken barn. [Laughs] We had a little desk and a telephone. And we eventually named what we 
were doing Habitat for Humanity. 
We moved into town. We needed to make a living. Millard set up a law office and 
Habitat, he and I, Mom and Pop, you know. Back then, telephone systems were very 
unsophisticated. We had one phone on each of our desks for Habitat, and another phone for the 
law office. [Laughs] And I had to remember, you know— 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
17 
 
EC: [Laughs] Which is—who are you answering? 
LD: [Laughs] Fuller Law Office or Habitat for Humanity! But that gave us the foundation 
to involve volunteers and grow Habitat for Humanity over the next thirty years to the point 
where we were in a hundred countries and have built houses for more than a million people. 
EC: Wow. That’s remarkable! Really remarkable. I want to go back. What was the 
Koinonia community like when you moved into the community? I know that you said that it 
changed a couple of times. And then we were also talking before we went on film, and you were 
telling me about what it was like when you would come into town when you were living out 
there. I would love to hear more about that. 
LD: When we moved to Koinonia in the summer of 1968, there were very few people at 
Koinonia. In fact, Clarence Jordan and his wife, well, they had one son still at home, they were 
exploring other places to go, because Koinonia had gotten to a real low ebb. There was only one 
other family there. There were a few blacks living there, but Clarence was feeling that the work 
was over there, and he would just go teach in a seminary or something like that. 
But then, when we wrote to him—well, actually, Millard wrote him, jotted him a little 
note when he was flying to a speaking engagement, and he said, “Clarence, I’m thinking about 
leaving Tougaloo, my work is almost done. What have you got up your sleeve?” [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: So, Clarence wrote back and said, “Well, I don’t have anything up my sleeve. But 
maybe God has something up His sleeve for both of us.” So, they got together at a church in 
Atlanta where Clarence was speaking at a revival, or a series of sermons. And, Clarence would 
preach at night. [0:40:00] And then, and Millard and Clarence would talk during the day, and

they [40:05] all kinds of possibilities. The idea was sort of—for us to move down to Koinonia 
and then maybe move to Atlanta to start some ministry. 
But the more we thought about it—and we brought in a group of friends, a variety of 
people, pastors, business people, and we brainstormed one big weekend. And they came up with 
this—they named it Koinonia Partnerships—and we would experiment with partnership housing, 
partnership industries, partnership farming, putting the disenfranchised people with the more 
skilled and more able people to build up society and give people a chance that they never had 
before. 
So, yeah, we [laughs]—if you go out there to Koinonia, you would see that it’s a very 
simple lifestyle, and most of the places for families are just very small clapboard houses that 
were built by volunteers over the years. And so, we actually moved into the apartment upstairs 
that Clarence and Florence lived at. It was one of the first structures that they had built back in 
the forties. 
And [laughs] I’ll never forget when my mother and daddy came for their first visit. You 
know, they were accustomed to visiting us in this big thirteen room house in Montgomery, 
Alabama, with luxury cars and all this kind of stuff. And they climbed up these rickety old stairs 
and walked into my kitchen. [Laughs] I thought my mother was going to faint. She said, “Oh, 
no! No progress in three generations!” [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: Oh, my goodness! You know, I don’t think they really ever caught on the 
significance of, you know—we were having so much richer a life there at Koinonia without all 
the glitz and glimmer of materialistic kind of things. [Laughs] But I don’t think they ever 
appreciated it. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
19 
 
EC: [Laughs] 
JB: [42:39]. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: [42:42]. 
LD: And then— yeah, so I don’t think they ever really appreciated our new lifestyle, our 
new focus on life. But to us, it was just thrilling. We felt like we were on the cutting edge of 
something really significant. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: And I mostly did work in the office, with the pecan workers and the mailing lists and 
interfaced with—we were kind of, like I say, it was very—a small group of people when we 
moved there. But very quickly, with these new initiatives, volunteers were coming in, a lot of 
them from the North. It was the hippie movement, you know, long hair, tattered jeans. And it 
was a time when people were questioning institutions and the way things were done traditionally. 
And they felt real challenge there and getting new direction on, you know, what was really right 
and getting their lives sort of at a point where they felt more comfortable, where they could move 
forward with the society. 
But we would go into town. I remember nobody had a car. We shared a car. We had to 
reserve a car if we wanted to go into town. But we would shop, you know, in the grocery stores. 
And people would look at me, and they’d say, “You’re new here in town, aren’t you?” And I’d 
say, “Yes.” “Well, where do you live?” And when I said, “Koinonia,” you know, it was like 
[laughing] they couldn’t get away from me fast enough! It was like I was a leper, you know. 
And I experienced that time after time. But it didn’t bother me a whole lot, because I 
knew we were doing the right thing. And I felt sorry for them, that they misunderstood or didn’t 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
20 
 
understand [0:45:00] the true nature of what we were doing. We never were beat up. But before 
we were there, back in the fifties, there were residents of Koinonia that were beat up. 
I can remember hearing about a story of Conrad Brown was walking down the street with 
a guy, and they were sharing a bag of peanuts, walking with one of the black residents of 
Koinonia, and they were both arrested. They were arrested! I mean, that was just a no-no, to be 
walking down the street, [laughs] sharing a bag of peanuts! 
Now, we did have a pretty harrowing experience. There was a young man, a family in 
Unadilla, Georgia. That’s about thirty or forty miles east of here, just across the Interstate 75. 
And this young man wanted to be a doctor, physician. And he knew that going to black 
schools—the schools were still segregated at that time. He knew that the education he was 
getting in his school wasn’t going to ever get him into med school. So, he applied—he 
challenged the system in that rural town. He wanted to get into the high school, the white high 
school. And, boy, that hit the news! 
We heard about it. It was on TV and the newspapers. We decided that we needed to go 
over there and show some support to the family and encourage them, you know, that what they 
were doing were right. So, Millard and I and Faith—[46:55] Faith, she was still in diapers, and 
she’s the one who did the documentary on Koinonia— 
EC: Yeah. 
JB: Hold that up so we can see better. 
LD: [Laughs] Okay. 
JB: Tell what it is. 
LD: Yeah. This is an hour-long documentary entitled Briars in the Cotton Patch that our 
daughter, Faith Fuller, produced back in the early 2000s. It was released in 2003, and she’s just 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
21 
 
done a tenth anniversary update of Briars. And it’s been shown on public television in every 
state in the nation, and it’s been shown during times like Black History Month, things like that. 
She realized as an adult that the story of Koinonia—here’s a picture of Clarence Jordan right 
here with a bunch of peanuts that he just got out of the field. She realized that the story had never 
really been told about—there had been books written, articles in newspapers and magazines, but 
there never had been a significant documentary of that story. 
And she took it on herself to produce this documentary, and she had never done a 
documentary before. It took her about three years. She did the research, she raised the money. As 
I recall, she needed about fifty thousand dollars to do all that needed—you know, there’s 
[laughs] as you probably understand, a lot of people don’t understand, it takes a lot of things 
other than just filming and editing film, in actually producing a film. There’s a lot that has to take 
place, along with that. So, we’re very proud that she did that. 
JB: [49:03] 
LD: It was founded by Clarence and Florence Jordan, and Martin and Mabel England, 
who only stayed about two or three years, I guess, but they were there in the very beginning. 
They basically started out with a poor plot of land, you know, red Georgia clay. And Clarence, 
being a graduate of the University of Georgia in agriculture, he loved farming. And so, he 
thought that, you know, that would be a good venue to start an intentional Christian community 
to live out the teachings of Jesus that he had studied about in seminary, Southern Baptist 
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. [0:50:00] 
He felt very strongly about this because, having grown up in a small South Georgia town, 
Talbotton, Georgia, he saw the discrimination. He had friends who were black friends that he 
could play with, but they couldn’t go in his house, for instance. They couldn’t go into his school. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
22 
 
He saw the restrictions there on his little friends at a very early age, and he began to question 
whether that was right or wrong. And then, of course, when he became a Greek New Testament 
scholar and read the original Greek, he could see that what he was reading there didn’t match up 
with the culture that he was raised in. And he wanted to experiment with these, what were pretty 
different principles—as you know, because that’s why the Civil Rights Movement was 
generated, because of all the injustices. [Clears throat] 
And it was—the first few years were pretty much establishing the farm, getting housing. I 
know that Florence and Clarence had a baby, and she lived with his parents in Talbotton the first 
couple of years, because there was no running water. I mean, it would have been very difficult 
for them to have the children there. But, you know, they established the traditions of a Christian 
community, sharing the noon meals—well, actually, I think they shared lunch and dinner at that 
time, a meal in common in the dining room. They held worship services. All of it was done in 
very simple structures. There was no actual church building. 
In fact, Clarence said [laughs] a guy came along in his Cadillac one day. Clarence was—
he was a very good mechanic, too. He happened to be under a tractor, repairing a motor, and he 
was all greasy, overalls, things like that. And so, he got up, you know, from under the tractor, 
and kind of wiped off his hands, and extended them for a handshake. And then the guy said, “I’m 
out here. I want to see if you are really a Christian community like you say you are. And I don’t 
see a church anywhere! You couldn’t be a Christian community!” [Laughs] 
EC: Well. [Laughs] Where did the other families and other people who ended up living at 
Koinonia come from? Were they local to the area, or did most people come from outside? 
LD: Most people came from outside. I think it was kind of rare for us to be Southerners 
and live there. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
23 
 
EC: Yeah. Was that true of the black families, as well as the white? 
LD: Most—all of the black families were local. They were from that county, pretty much. 
One of the reasons why it had gotten down to such small numbers when we moved there in 1968 
is because the black families were threatened. Now, some kind of organized and moved up 
North, New York, I think. They established another Koinonia community up North, but I think it 
kind of fizzled out after a while. 
But the black families that stayed, they were threatened, to the point where they said, “If 
you continue to go to Koinonia, we’re going to burn your house down.” Or, “We’re going to kill 
members of your family.” I mean, really serious threats! And they—the lady who worked in the 
candy kitchen at Koinonia, Ms. Gussie Jackson, this happened way before we moved there, but 
they threatened to burn her house down, and they did! They set it on fire, and she was at home at 
the time. And she went running out and fell on her knees and prayed to God to put out that fire. 
And it went out! 
EC: Really? 
LD: [Laughs] But [0:55:00] I don’t know that they were ever successful in burning down 
any of the houses, but it scared people so badly that they kind of just drifted away. 
EC: Yeah. And this in the fifties and sixties, probably? 
LD: Yeah, I would say late fifties. 
EC: Yeah. So, were most of the black families that were involved with Koinonia, they 
didn’t live on the property? 
LD: Some did, some didn’t. 
EC: Okay. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
24 
 
LD: Some still worked for farmers, doing the seasonal crops. And then, in the wintertime, 
when we needed help in the pecan and fruitcake and candy kitchen, they would come and have 
temporary employment there. But, you know, by the time we got there, there were still people 
that were afraid to associate too closely with Koinonia. As long as they just were going there for 
a job, that was kind of different. 
EC: That was okay? 
LD: Yeah. And a few would come and join us for a community lunch sometimes, but 
they were still nervous about those threats that were made years earlier. 
EC: Yeah. You said that—you were telling a story about, you said, a harrowing 
experience where the black student in Unanita, Georgia—? 
LD: Oh! I never did finish that story, did I? 
EC: No. 
LD: In Unadilla. 
EC: Unadilla? 
LD: Unadilla, Georgia. Okay. So, it was about this time of year or a little earlier. I 
remember there was an older guy that had a big strawberry patch, and we’d just picked bowls 
full of strawberries that morning. So, we thought it would be a nice thing to do to take the family 
some strawberries. So, it was Millard and me and Faith. Yeah, I know how we got sidetracked—
on Briars in the Cotton Patch. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: So, we get over there and we find the house, and no one was there. It was probably 
like about two o’clock. So, we figured, well, she’s off at work. I’ve forgotten the name of the 
family right now, but—and we figured, well, the kids are still at school. So, we sat on the front 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
25 
 
porch. And pretty soon, a few of the children came home from school, and they didn’t know us 
from Adam’s house cat. And so, we talked to them and told them why we were there and kind of 
let them know that we were friendly. 
Well, the mother hadn’t gotten home yet, but all of a sudden this police car comes roaring 
up. And the policeman got out of the car, and he had his gun. And he said, “What are you doing 
here at this nigger’s house?” And we said, “Well, we just came to visit.” And he said, “Well, 
don’t you know it’s against the city ordinance for whites to visit with niggers?” And we said—
Millard said, he’s kind of a little smart aleck, but he said, “Well, no, but if you have such an 
ordinance, you know, it’s not worth the paper it’s written on.” 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: Boy, did that make him mad! And he said, “Okay, you’re under arrest!” And I was 
still up on the porch, holding Faith in my arms. And Millard was down, you know, close to the 
policeman. And so, I said to myself, “I’m not going to let him take Millard off in his police car.” 
And so, I walked down and I said, “If my husband was doing something wrong, I was, too. 
You’ve got to arrest me, too!” [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] And the baby. 
LD: Yeah! [Laughs] Okay, so he took us down to City Hall to the jail. And he said, 
“Okay, you sit over there. I’m going to call the City Commissioner, or the County 
Commissioner, and we’re going to have a meeting about this.” So, we sit there. We sit there. And 
I begin to think, “Oh, my gosh, if they lock us up, what am I going to use for diapers?” I mean, I 
didn’t bring any extra diapers. I thought, “Well, how am I going to manage this?” 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
26 
 
So, we sat there and we sat there. And Faith was toddling around. There was a piano in 
there. And she walked over and she starts playing the notes. And I go, “Shhh! Don’t! We don’t 
want to disturb them.” Millard said, “Oh, let her go ahead and make all the noise she wants!” 
EC: [Laughs] [1:00:00] 
LD: He was more ticked off than I was. [Clears throat] Well, it wasn’t long before they 
came out and they said, “Okay. Since this is only the first time you’ve done this, that we have 
record of this, we’re going to let you go for now. But—” and Millard heard this, but I didn’t even 
really understand what they were saying. He says, “But we’re not responsible for you.” [1:00:28] 
Millard read that, you know, [laughs] they were going to come after us and try to do us harm. So, 
they said, “Okay, you can go.” We said, “Well, you brought us here. You’ve got to take us back 
to our car.” [Laughs] 
So, Millard said, “Okay.” He said, “We’re going to get out of here and we’re going to go 
to the first motel that we can find and check in.” And by the time we got there and registered and 
were walking in our room, we saw a van pull in with four men in the van. So, we got in the motel 
room. I didn’t know what to expect by then. So, I took Faith back into the bathroom. It was like 
your general motel rooms, where the bathrooms are always in the back. I thought, [laughing] “If 
they’re going to start shooting at us, maybe that would be the safest place.” 
Millard got on the phone. He called—he looked in the Yellow Pages at the churches. And 
so, the first church he called was the Episcopal church. He thought that maybe they would be the 
most sympathetic. And the rector answered, and Millard explained the situation, that we may be 
in a threatening position, and would he come over and help us. And he said, “Oh!” he said, “I 
promised the ladies that I would come and speak to their little tea this afternoon. I’m sorry. I 
cannot come.” Well, then I think he called a couple more churches. There was no answer. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
27 
 
So, he thought, “I’m going to take my chances and call the sheriff of this county and see 
if he’ll come. So, apparently, he and the police chief weren’t such good friends, so he did come 
over. And, in fact, he got in touch with the FBI. Maybe they had had some incidents like this 
before. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: But he finally kind of calmed things down. We had called Clarence to come get us, 
to follow us home. But it was kind of scary. 
EC: Did Koinonia—? 
JB: [1:03:02] 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
EC: You mentioned that back in Montgomery when Morris Dees and your husband were 
telling the Klansman that they weren’t going to subscribe anymore, that they pulled the pistol 
out. At Koinonia, did any of the residents ever use self-defense? 
LD: No. There were no guns. I think they had one—I think Clarence had one gun in his 
house, but he would use it to, like, kill wild dogs or, you know, something like that. But they 
were totally against returning violence for violence. 
EC: Very difficult in that context. 
LD: In fact, at one point, when cars were riding by and shooting into the farm, sometimes 
bullets would narrowly escape kids that were playing outside. There are still today some bullet 
holes. In fact, the place where we were living, there was a bullet hole that came in and just barely 
missed one of the Jordan daughters. It shattered a mirror, but it missed her by inches. Nobody 
was ever killed. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
28 
 
But they thought, well, you know, these are basically coward kind of folks, and they 
would take turns sitting out at the road at night, just to demonstrate that they weren’t afraid, and 
if they want to shoot, just go right ahead, you know. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: And there’s a lot covered in, you know, in the documentary, the Briars documentary, 
about those kinds of incidents, and how the children felt about it. They were interviewed, and a 
lot more detail on that. 
EC: Yeah. I’m looking forward to it, to seeing it. Where did your children go to school 
[1:05:00] when you moved here? That must have been an interesting situation. 
LD: Well, we were out in the county, and at that time and for the longest time, until just 
recent years, there were two schools. There was the county school and the city school. And we 
were living in the county. Interestingly enough, when we got—well, let me just say this. When 
we first moved here, we only had two school-aged kids, and they went to a little school, a 
country school. And then, we went away to Africa, and the oldest two were in an American 
school in Kinshasa, and that was wonderful. [Laughs] That was a much better education than 
they were receiving here. When we came back, we had three in public school, and our youngest 
child, who was born at Koinonia, went to the child development center that we had started before 
we left. 
And interestingly enough, the daughter, Faith, that made the documentary, she was in 
class with Amy Carter. It was right at the end of the Carter campaign that we came back from 
Africa. And Faith and Amy were in fourth grade together. The school was over in Plains, where 
the Carters still live. But, yeah, there were Secret Service in the class. And they allowed Amy to 
go climb a tree and read, rather than play on the playground. That was kind of interesting. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
29 
 
But the older two, Chris and Kim, went to high school at Plains. And they would come 
home from school, especially the daughter, who was in, what, ninth grade by this time, crying 
because the schools were just awful. And these were white schools! But the building had become 
in such disarray. It eventually became the Carter Museum in Plains, and a lot of restoration of 
that school took place. It’s a beautiful building now. But it was in horrible condition then. I know 
that she complained about bird droppings coming from the ceiling. And the teachers would just 
pretty much let them look at magazines and not much instruction going on. 
The quality of the schools greatly improved. That’s one of the things that encouraged us 
to move into town: the fact that Koinonia really didn’t want to be part of the worldwide 
movement, and then, we needed better schools for our kids. And they had better schools here in 
the city. So, they got a really good education here. When schools were integrated, I’d say, in the 
late seventies, the quality of education continued to be really good, to the point where all of our 
kids went to college, finished college. There are complaints that the education kids are getting 
here is not adequate, but any kid who wants to go to college, we have an excellent college here in 
Americus. We have a big technical college. So, even if, since we’re a small town here, we have 
good quality. 
EC: Yeah. So, the schools didn’t integrate here until the late seventies? 
LD: I believe that’s right. I don’t think they were integrated when we first came back 
from Africa. I think it was pretty soon after that. 
EC: Yeah. Sort of nationally, one of the big moments was around 1970, when there was a 
big Supreme Court decision that said you can’t operate separate schools in the same district, and 
I wondered if that had an impact around here? 
LD: Well, it takes—took a while! [Laughs] 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
30 
 
EC: [Laughs] Moved a little slow? 
LD: It moved pretty slowly. I could be wrong. 
EC: I’m just curious. 
LD: I don’t think they were integrated in 1976 when we came back from Africa, but I 
think it was a short time after that. 
EC: After that, yeah. Did you know much about the Civil Rights Movement in Americus 
after you moved here, or did you hear much about it? 
LD: Other than what—the stories at Koinonia. That was [1:10:00] pretty much, I don’t 
know if I can term it a hot spot, or that was where a lot of transformation occurred, at Koinonia. I 
heard more about what happened in the general area after we had been here a while. We have a 
wonderful historian—his name is Alan Anderson—who has studied the history of Sumter 
County from the very beginning. And he wrote a book. He’s got a lot of details about those kinds 
of things. 
EC: You know, one of the things that Americus is kind of infamous for, I guess, is the 
little girls that were arrested and put in jail. This would have been before you were here, but I 
wondered if something like that is part of a consciousness of the community. 
LD: I met one of them!  
EC: Did you? 
LD: Yeah. I can’t remember her name, but I met one of them, who was arrested. 
EC: Yeah. Is that something that people in the area—I’m also interested in historic 
memory, so I’m sort of wondering, like, how—you know, like in the community that I grew up 
in, I’m sort of interested in how people understand the past. And so, I wonder if it’s something 
that people around here think about or talk about much? 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
31 
 
LD: I remember now where I met her. Koinonia had a celebration of its—the seventy-
fifth anniversary at Koinonia was last year. 
EC: Oh, okay. 
LD: And people came from all over that had lived at Koinonia at one time or the other. 
And I met a lot of these folks that I had heard stories about. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: And, yeah, it was really interesting. Oh! I can tell you about an incident that 
happened in 1965 that I had forgotten about. 
EC: Alright. 
LD: That was when we came to visit some friends of ours. He had been kicked out of his 
church in Birmingham, Alabama, for proposing, you know, that they should be more welcoming 
to black people. And so, he was—he came over to Koinonia to live. I mean, they were just 
[laughs] really out, really didn’t know what to do. And so, we—he had actually preached in our 
little church that we started in our home in Montgomery, Alabama. 
And we came to visit them. And this was right after we decided to leave business and 
give away our money and we were looking for new direction. So, we decided to look the Henrys 
up, Carol and Al Henry, and that’s when we first met Clarence. And we were so amazed at 
Koinonia and its history, and the simple lifestyle was appealing to us then, because we were 
getting rid of all our material possessions and wealth. We stayed a month, instead of two hours. 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: A month! [Laughs] 
EC: Oops! 
LD: Yeah. And so, that was December. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
32 
 
EC: Yeah? 
LD: Almost all of December of 1965. Well, Carol Henry’s father was head of the 
Georgia Baptist Convention or—yeah, I think it was, that’s what it was. And he had been invited 
to speak at a Christmas church service at night at First Baptist Church in Americus, which was 
totally segregated, this total white congregation. And so, he came out to visit his daughter, had 
lunch with us, and he said, “You know, I’m preaching tonight. I want to invite all of you to 
come.” 
Well, you know, here we were, an integrated group. And so, we had a little discussion 
about that in the afternoon. And Clarence said, “Well, we’ve been invited. We ought to go, 
whoever wants to go.” So, we loaded up in several cars. There were probably about twenty of us, 
Clarence, Millard and me, Collins McGee—he was the only black person that would go with us. 
All the rest were—Al and Carol Henry, and some of the other residents of Koinonia. 
So, we started filing in. A big crowd was coming into First Baptist Church on Lee Street 
in Americus. So, we were kind of single file. And the deacons were passing out programs 
[1:15:00] for the service. And when a black hand reached out to take one of the programs, you 
know, it was like [laughs] what?! 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: But, I mean, things continued. We all got in and we occupied one full pew. And so, 
we were settling in, and there were several little ladies on the pew in front of us. And they looked 
back and they started whispering, and then, they got up and they moved somewhere else. Same 
thing happened to the people that were seated behind us. They got up and moved somewhere 
else. So, here we were, like an island [laughs] on this one pew in the church. And they started 
singing a Christmas hymn. Oh, gosh, what was that [1:16:02]? I’ll think of it in a minute. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
33 
 
Anyway, along comes the head deacon, who happened to be the fire chief in town. And 
he comes in and he grabs ahold of Collins McGee and he says, “You’ve got to get out of here!” 
And Clarence said, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We were invited to come here.” He said, you 
know, “We’re here to worship with you, to have, to enjoy this service with you.” And he said, 
“That’s beside the point! You can stay, but he’s got to get out of here,” you know, jerking on 
Collins’ arm. And Clarence said, “Never mind, never mind.” He said, “If you don’t want Collins 
here, we’re gonna all leave.” And so, we all got up and we left. 
So, there were a few deacons that came and talked to Clarence and Millard and a few 
others, and said, “What are you doing bringing this nigger into our church?! Don’t you know that 
we don’t allow that?!” And so, Clarence said, “Well, sir, I thought this was God’s church, and 
God is no respecter of persons.” He said, “We didn’t come here to do harm.” He said, “That’s 
beside the point!” [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: “The federal government doesn’t own this church! We own this church!” And so, 
you know, we left. And it was interesting. As we walked out to the sidewalk, Clarence—I never 
will forget. I can remember seeing him do this today. He turned around and he looked at the 
church, big white columns, and there were floodlights, you know, just beaming on this church 
building. And Clarence made the remark, “Just look a’there at all that light on the outside, and 
it’s dark on the inside.” 
There were times when we lived at Koinonia that groups came in. I have pictures about 
those incidences where we had black visitors that wanted to attend church in town, so Clarence 
and Millard and a few others would go with them. But they were armed. The deacons were 
armed during that time. Now, since then, there’s been a huge change. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
34 
 
EC: Yeah? 
LD: Blacks are welcome at almost any church here in town. There’s been a huge change. 
EC: Do you know how that came about? 
LD: Well, I guess the culture began to change as the old generations began to die off. 
And some of the laws changed. I mean, some of the—of course, you couldn’t really force 
churches to make that change. Clarence often says, “You know, everything’s integrated except 
the jails and the churches, and I have hope for the jails.” [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] Well? 
LD: But, you know, it just happened over time. I’d like to think that Habitat’s ministry 
developing here in Americus had something to do with it, because we had people coming in from 
all over the United States, some people from different countries in the world. And I think it 
helped to broaden people’s ideas of who [1:20:00] God’s children were. 
EC: I wondered how the local community felt and feels about Habitat and the work that 
you’ve done. 
LD: Well, at first, you know, it was uncomfortable. I remember when we bought a house 
in town on Church Street, we moved into town from Koinonia, and our kids started going out 
and playing with the children in the neighborhood. And when they learned that we had moved 
into town from Koinonia, they didn’t allow their kids to play with our kids anymore for a while. 
And we had broken glass on our driveway most every morning when we would wake up, and I’d 
just go sweep it in my dustpan. 
But there were two tragedies that happened within a week after we moved in. One was a 
huge house that had been on the market that had just sold, like a big three-story mansion of a 
house, caught fire about a block down from where we lived. Millard was away on a speaking 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
35 
 
engagement. And I woke up during the night and I heard all these car doors slamming. Oh, my 
goodness! [Laughs] You know? Now, not only do we have broken glass on our driveway, but, 
you know, there’s some action being taken here. So, I didn’t turn on any light and I tiptoed to the 
front window. And I looked out and was relieved to see that these pickup trucks, people that 
were getting out of the pickup trucks were hurrying down the street. And then, I looked and saw 
the big fire. So, I breathed a sigh of relief there. 
But then, word began to spread, you know, that we were starting work kind of like what 
we had at Koinonia, and now it was in Americus, Georgia, and some hippie-kind of people were 
coming, you know, volunteers. And [sighs] there was very little understanding of what we were 
trying to do to eradicate poverty housing. And there were some really bad areas. Most—a lot of 
the streets had not been paved, just terrible shacks. 
And so, you know, we got organized. We not only started work here in Americus, but we 
were starting down in South Florida, in Immokalee, where a lot of migrant workers were. We 
were starting work in Appalachia, also on John’s Island, South Carolina, where there was a lot of 
poverty. People were getting in touch with us, because they had heard through Koinonia 
newsletters and the newsletters that we were producing, you know, that we were spreading this 
idea and that we were willing to come help them get started. 
[Sighs] But I think there were two things that really changed and opened people’s hearts 
here in Americus, Georgia. One was there were a lot of seniors, all ages, that were coming here 
to help us, that were volunteers at Habitat, and they would go to the local churches and they 
would begin to explain what we were all about. Then, when we started having blitz-builds, like 
building ten, twenty houses in a week’s time, and we had hundreds of people coming to work on 
those projects. And we started involving the local churches, getting them to sponsor a half of a 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
36 
 
house, and a few of them came out and volunteered. The idea began to catch on, and people 
began to see, really, what we were all about, that we were trying to put God’s love in action to 
really help people. 
EC: How were you able to get the first churches locally to get onboard? 
LD: Well, some really nice people, mostly from up North, would start attending the 
churches, and they would make friends. And then, they would invite their friends to come and 
participate that week. And, you know, a week, that wasn’t very threatening, so they would do it. 
EC: Sure. 
LD: But I think the thing that really changed the climate [1:24:48] the business 
community. They saw where our volunteers came and bought a lot of groceries, [laughs] a lot of 
this and a lot of that, you know. So, it was a boost for the economy. [1:25:00] Plus, we were 
bringing in—we were employing people, too, permanent people who were buying houses, you 
know. And the business people began to be, you know, more supportive. 
We were bringing in—our first year of Habitat, we raised about seventy thousand. 
Nobody knew about it, you know. It was a real struggle in the early years. Before the Carters got 
involved, really, in 1984, it was a real struggle to raise money. And then, right before we left 
Habitat in 2005, commonly a quarter of a million or more dollars would come in every day. 
EC: Every day. 
LD: Every day. We had work in a hundred countries and had over nine hundred 
employees [1:25:57]. 
EC: Were they mostly in Americus or—? 
LD: Yeah, yeah. And then, after we left, the board made the decision to move Habitat 
headquarters to Atlanta. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
37 
 
EC: So, that must have had an impact on the Americus economy. 
LD: It sure did. 
EC: Oh. 
LD: It did, unfortunately. 
EC: Yeah. When you would have—when you would do the blitz builds and so, you’d 
have people come in for a week or something, where would they be staying? 
LD: Oh, well, some of them stayed in private homes, and that kind of helped spread the 
word, too. 
EC: I wondered about—yeah, yeah. 
LD: Sometimes they bunked down in churches, or sometimes the college. They were on 
break and made dormitory rooms available. So, that helped to educate the community, too, 
getting them involved. And they could see what a difference it was making in the lives of 
families! The kids started doing better in school. I remember I had a teacher, who told me—we 
were in the grocery store, and she said, “Wow!” She said. “It’s amazing the difference in the 
student in my class since they moved into a Habitat home, better behaved and better grades.” 
And so, it was those kind of experiences that helped people to see that we were really on to 
something here. [Laughs] 
EC: Yeah, nothing like having a decent standard of living, right? 
LD: Decent standard of living, yeah! 
EC: You know, when you were talking about those discussions, I think, in 1968, about 
sort of what direction, and when you moved to Koinonia and developed the housing and the 
economic development, it seems like, you know, roughly at the same time, in that same era, 
there’s a whole coop movement going on and there’s all sorts of programs that are partly coming 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
38 
 
out of the Civil Rights Movement and partly related to the war on poverty. Are you part of these 
larger conversations? Is that influencing the thinking that you all were involved in at the time in 
the work you were doing? 
LD: Well, certainly, we tried to keep our focus on housing. There were temptations to 
broaden our ministry into other areas. But we were certainly working side by side with other 
organizations, other efforts to build awareness of needs of humanity, not only here in the United 
States, but around the world. 
EC: Where did your international interest come from, do you know? 
LD: Well, our goal right from the beginning was to eliminate poverty housing in the 
world. Right after we had left Montgomery, left business, we decided that we wanted to visit 
missionaries in Africa. And we had United Church of Christ, which was Millard’s church that he 
was raised in, to arrange a tour. Actually, they had asked him to do this, to visit missionaries and 
come back and tell about what he saw, and to raise money and awareness of mission work. But 
he turned them down because he figured it would cost him too much. [Laughs] It’d slow him 
down on his first million too much! So, we decided that that was one of the first things we 
wanted to do. And it was a six-week trip. Got grandparents to take care of the kids, and [1:30:00] 
we went to five countries in Africa. And, as it turned out, we went back to one of the places we 
visited. 
EC: Which countries did you go on that first trip? 
LD: We went to Tanzania, what was then Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe, South 
Africa, Ghana, and what was then called the Congo. When we lived there in the seventies, it was 
Zaire, and now it’s Congo again, the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
EC: Yeah, right. How did you decide to go back to Congo/Zaire? 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
39 
 
LD: Well, you know, when we visited there, the church wanted to reinstitute a business 
that a Belgian businessman had started, and somehow or another, the church had acquired it. But 
the dump truck was worn out, and several other aspects of the concrete block business had just 
broken down. So, Millard promised that he would come back home and raise money to buy them 
a new dump truck. So, we had that connection there. 
And so, when we started thinking about where we could build houses, we thought of that 
place, you know, and what a perfect place. The church invited us to come and help with the 
economy [1:31:32]. We thought, well, we’ll just make concrete blocks and build houses. So, it 
was just kind of a natural—well, we feel like it was a God-given thing, you know, that evolved. 
EC: How did it influence you to live outside the country for that long, you know, and 
take your children? 
LD: Well, I don’t know. I’ve always been adventuresome. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: I told you that my parents were in the appliance business. And we went to Florida 
one week out of the year, and that’s it! [Laughs] I didn’t go anywhere else. So, I was interested 
in seeing other parts of the world. That trip that we made when I was twenty-five years old to 
Africa, it broadened my horizons a lot. And it just—and Millard was adventuresome, too, you 
know. We had learned how to live simply, learned how to make yogurt, make bread, all those 
kind of things at Koinonia, so it was kind of a good training ground for being a missionary. 
EC: Yeah. [Laughs] 
LD: Plus, my own simple upbringing. My mother taught me to sew and to cook, you 
know. We were good at surviving most anywhere, you know. So, we just—we had this vision, 
and any time we’d go to a new country or a new place, we’d read books and, you know, we tried 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
40 
 
to understand the culture. And we built what we called appropriate technology—we used 
appropriate technologies to keep the cost of the houses down, whatever the style house, whatever 
materials were available in that area, and, you know, doing a lot of manual labor so that we 
wouldn’t have machines breaking down. 
And we enjoyed visiting families. In fact, many times, we would stay with families that 
had moved into a Habitat house. Sri Lanka, South Korea, Fiji. Families thought it was kind of 
interesting, you know, that the founders and the president and his wife of Habitat for Humanity 
would want to stay in their little humble abode. But we took great joy, because that gave us 
inspiration for wanting to provide that for more and more families. 
EC: Um-hmm. I was listening to those countries you listed. Some of those had just been 
through anti-colonial movements, or had just sort of—and some were still colonial countries. 
LD: Um-hmm. 
EC: Did you have a sense of that at the time or notice any differences? 
LD: Hmm, that’s an interesting question. Of course, that was certainly the case in Zaire. 
Now, Congo—the Belgian—they had won their independence, actually, right about the same 
time we visited [1:35:00] for the first time in 1965. So, it was still—because of independence, 
you know, most of the Belgian business people had left. The Catholic Church and foreign 
missionaries were there. But it was a time when a few populations had come into the cities to 
find work. They were now free. They didn’t have to stay out of the city. They no longer had to 
have a car to move around. So, they were just flooding into the cities, which made the housing 
situation just overwhelming. We built a hundred and twenty houses, but that was just a drop in 
the bucket. 
EC: Yeah 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
41 
 
LD: See, after we left, though, more and more houses— 
EC: It continued? 
LD: It continued and it spread. It spread into other parts of Zaire and other, [1:36:05]. 
Now, I guess that would also apply to South Africa. They were still—apartheid was strong back 
in 1965 and also when we started work there. But we started work in the townships first of all. 
And there were other programs where there was job training and opportunities for people to start 
little [1:36:40] industries, and that way they could afford to make the payments for our Habitat 
houses. 
So, it was a way to liberate, get people out from underneath the oppression, just like we 
did at Koinonia. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: Oh, we had farmers to come and—I know we were just—almost finished with a 
house, family about ready to move in, and here comes a farmer on his horse! It had rained, and 
he just went round and round and round on his horse, and he just made a mess of the front yard. 
He was mad. 
And there was another instance where Ethel [1:37:28] had worked in the kitchen, done 
housework for a farmer and his wife. And they found out that they were going to move and have 
a house of their own and move off of their farm. And they cut off their water! They had to haul 
water in barrels for several months while their house was under construction. And to beat all, that 
woman had enough nerve to come and ask Ethel to bake cakes for them at Christmas! 
EC: [Laughs] She miscalculated maybe? 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
42 
 
LD: And they never turned the water back on. She asked them to, but they never did. 
[Clears throat] Excuse me. But she told me, she said, “You know, I baked those cakes.” She said, 
“I had to show them that I was bigger than them.” 
EC: But they never came around? 
LD: Not that I know of. 
EC: You mentioned a few minutes ago a church in your home in Montgomery that you 
started. Can you tell us about that? 
LD: When we moved to Montgomery, we wanted to go to a church. Millard grew up in a 
Congregational church. It eventually became United Church of Christ when the Congregational 
merged with Evangelical and Reform churches. And he said, “Well, there isn’t a Congregational 
church here in Montgomery. Let’s start one.” So, we started it in our home and, you know, we 
built it up to about twenty people. And then, we found a—we actually started meeting in the 
chapel of Huntington College. They let us do that on Sunday morning for a while. And then, we 
built a little building on the outskirts of Montgomery, a church out there. 
EC: Were you just lay ministers then? Or did you have a minister? 
LD: No, we didn’t like—oh, well, we eventually hired one, but Al Henry was [1:40:00] 
one of our visiting ministers until we hired a full-time minister. Back then they [1:40:10] 
[Laughs] 
JB: [1:40:11] 
LD: Anyway, there is a book that Millard wrote. Actually, he was pretty good at writing 
diaries when he was in business. He kept a record of what was happening every day, and he 
would record other things that he was involved in, like developing the church, he helped to get 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
43 
 
property, and things like that. And I guess we were the largest donors in the congregation until 
we left. [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: Ten percent, no. Not even one percent. 
EC: Yeah. 
LD: But we say that after we left, the church died. So, our church membership died and 
went to heaven. And we didn’t join another church until we joined Maranatha Baptist Church in 
Plains. Jimmy Carter twisted our arm and said, “Okay, I joined Habitat. Now, I want you to join 
our church.” So, we did. [Laughs] 
Well, let’s see, now. Where were we? I think I got a little off track. 
EC: Oh, I just asked you about that church. I was actually—in your biography and some 
of these high points that you put together, which was very helpful, you mention some of the law 
cases that your husband Millard was involved with, you said, sort of representing some African 
Americans who were seeking employment in law enforcement. And then, you mention here 
something about a black boycott in Americus in 1971. Can you tell us about some of that? 
LD: Um-hmm. Yeah. When we were living at Koinonia, we became aware of some 
pretty serious police brutality against black people. And at that time, the police force and the 
sheriff, county law enforcement also, was totally segregated—all white. Well, the schools were, 
you know, soon to integrate. But anyway, it was a real kind of volatile time, and changes were 
taking place. But the law enforcement was totally white. And there were some black people that 
wanted to get employed. And things just kind of came to a head when there was so much 
brutality against black people and very unfair administration of enforcement of laws. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
44 
 
So, the black people just rebelled. They kind of stood up and said, “This has got to stop!” 
And when it didn’t, then they said, “Okay, well, we’re not going to do any business in town. If 
we have to, we’ll go to neighboring communities to buy our groceries.” And so, that got the 
attention. That got the attention. 
There was a march in downtown Americus. And we actually—I participated in that, as 
well as Millard. We walked down the street. There was not a car. Everybody stayed in the stores. 
People were peering out the windows. I mean, [laughs] everybody was afraid, you know, that 
riots were going to break out. But we wanted it to be a peaceful march. We just wanted to show 
determination and demonstrate how serious [1:44:25]. 
I can remember so well there was a meeting called in one of the churches, black 
churches. And Millard was asked to speak. And everybody was just so riled up. And Millard 
started speaking in his usual, you know, enthusiastic kind of tone. And he realized that he had to 
calm himself down, because the crowd was about to lose it. And he [1:45:00] was able to calm 
things down and to have a focus on what would actually bring about change. 
And he said, “Some of you black folks ought to step up and apply for some of these 
jobs.” So, when they did, of course, they were turned down. But then, they were able to file a law 
case on that, so they eventually—some of them got hired. And then, and then there was a woman 
that wanted to get on the force. Here again, you know. [Laughs] Oh, and they used the excuse, 
“Oh, she’s too pretty.” 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: You know, “This might distract the men from doing their jobs.” And Millard said, 
“That won’t wash. That will not wash.” And so, he got her hired. [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
45 
 
LD: But then, also, he became aware of the tremendous injustices as far as tort cases, 
death penalty, murder cases, for blacks accused of murder. And he began to get involved in 
taking some of those what we call death penalty or death row cases. And even if it was obvious 
that someone was guilty—it was really bad if they had killed a white person. That was almost 
certain death penalty. 
And all the juries were pretty much white. And Millard figured out why, or else in his 
partnering with people like Millard Farmer in Atlanta, who was also doing a lot of the death 
cases, they discovered that black folks did not believe in the death penalty, because they knew 
that it worked against black people. So, when there was the selection of the jury, all an attorney 
had to do was to ask, “Do you believe in the death penalty,” and they would say, “No.” And they 
would never get selected. So, therefore, you had an all-white jury, and it was easy to persuade 
them to come back with a verdict of guilty and, you know, they wanted to call for the death 
penalty. 
So, Millard was very persuasive. He was just great in a courtroom. [Laughs] And he took 
great pride in getting a jury to pray with him one time. 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: He wanted them, you know, to focus in on, you know, “Is this really what God 
would want you to—?” [Laughs] This was before the days when courthouses were air 
conditioned. And about after lunch, you know, things would get—it was hard for the jury, the 
persons on the jury to stay awake. And he would wait for one of them to nod off, you know, like 
this. And he’d start saying, “This is a serious matter, somebody’s life, you know. And if you’re a 
Christian, you need to really consider whether you should sentence this person to death.” And he 
said, “It’s so serious, we need to pray about this.” He said, “Let’s bow our heads.” And he’d look 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
46 
 
over to the one that was sound asleep and say, “Thank you,” you know. [Laughs] And then, 
people would think he was already praying, and so they’d bow their heads. 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: [Laughs] I tell you, whatever it took, he was able to—to bring justice. A lot of the 
times, it would involve a life sentence, but at least he kept people off of death row. 
EC: Did he ever work with Donald Hollowell on any of those cases? Do you know? 
Donald Hollowell? He was a black lawyer from Atlanta. He ended up working with the EEOC, I 
think, at a certain point. But I think he was involved—it might have been involved in a different 
era, slightly, but I think he was involved in trying to fight some of the inequities in the death 
penalty cases in Georgia, too. [1:50:00] 
LD: That name does not sound familiar. Millard practiced law until Habitat got so big 
that he just didn’t have the time for it anymore. I thought it was a shame, because he was so 
good. At one point, he partnered with a lawyer in Columbus, who did most of the preparation 
and the depositions on a case. And then, a couple of days before, he would inform Millard of the 
facts and everything, and then, Millard actually was lead lawyer in the case. But he had to give it 
up, because Habitat was just growing at such a phenomenal rate. 
EC: Yeah. That is pretty extraordinary. You know, it was interesting for me to read more 
of the history, because I guess I grew up with the idea of Habitat as this well-established, you 
know, organization. I learned more about how it was founded, so interesting, you know, to think 
of it as always well-established, you know, and so successful. There was something I was 
thinking about, and now it’s—. 
What was it like to participate in that march? Were you the only whites, or among the 
only whites in that march you were mentioning in Americus? 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
47 
 
LD: We weren’t the only whites. I think there were some other people from Koinonia that 
participated. 
EC: But primarily Koinonia, not—? 
LD: Yeah, uh-huh. 
EC: Yeah. What was it—I mean, did you have any fear or any concerns about being a 
part of the march? 
LD: Um, yeah, a little bit. 
EC: Right. 
LD: But, you know, I knew what I was doing was right. And by that time, we had lived at 
Koinonia for a good long while, having moved there in ’68, and the march was ’71. Um, I—it 
was just that we were taught to do what you feel in your heart is right. And if you get harmed or 
get put in jail or even lose your life, you know, you’ve done the right thing. Take a stand for 
something. 
EC: How do you think the Civil Rights Movement and your—I mean, it’s obvious that 
your Christian faith is clearly significant. Does that intersect with the Civil Rights Movement in 
the ways that you and Millard chose to focus your lives? 
LD: Oh, absolutely, you know. It was part of what was the most prevalent at that time in 
history. It was the most obvious thing that needed to be changed. 
EC: Yeah. Were there things that you missed about your old life? 
LD: [Laughs] No. [Laughs] Not really. 
EC: Yeah. Did you lose friends who were part of the sort of white society? 
LD: I’d say I gained a whole lot more friends than I lost. Oh, yeah. That’s an 
understatement, yeah. It was our families that were disgusted, really, disappointed. We were 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
48 
 
shunned by most of our family members, on my side of the family and Millard’s side of the 
family. They just didn’t get it. They didn’t understand why we were running counter to the 
culture. In fact, there were a few, when we left business and gave our money away, they said, 
“You need to be in a mental institute,” [laughs] giving up all that money. But it was like what 
was holding us back from a real life, and it destroyed our marriage. We just wanted to gun it and 
start totally over. 
EC: Was it hard to deal with your family feelings? 
LD: Yeah. Yeah, it was. My mother didn’t want to discuss anything that was 
controversial. And we tried to have [1:55:00] discussions with my dad, and we just finally gave 
up. [Sighs] We just kept it on our family and grandkids and, you know. 
EC: What about your sister? 
LD: My sister was very supportive. When she and her husband married a couple of years 
before we did, Millard and I, they had moved to California. And that was sort of one of the hearts 
of liberal thinking out there. So, yeah, I should have made a mention of that, but my sister 
certainly was accepting. 
EC: It seems interesting that, then, Morris Dees also sort of seems to follow a similar 
path, I guess, [1:55:51] in founding the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
LD: Um-hmm, exactly. Yeah. He started off—I think one of his first things was to 
integrate the Alabama State Patrol, something like that. 
EC: That’s a challenge, yeah. 
LD: That was a big deal. 
EC: I’m sure. 
Linda Fuller Degelmann, May 28, 2013 
 
49 
 
LD: And then, he got more into representing people who had been harmed by the Klan or 
other subversive [1:56:26] groups. His support greatly expanded and diversified to other 
minority groups. 
EC: Um-hmm. Does that go back to that same incident with the Freedom Ride? 
LD: I never asked him that question, but I would certainly think so. 
EC: Did he stay in touch with you all? Or do you think he was influenced by the 
decisions that you all made? 
LD: I don’t know. We didn’t have much contact. We were really busy into Koinonia and 
Africa and work with Habitat. And he was kind of doing his thing, you know. And once in 
awhile our paths would cross, but there wasn’t a whole lot of contact there. 
EC: Yeah. Kind of interesting the trajectory there. 
LD: Um-hmm. 
EC: I haven’t talked—I mean, I haven’t asked you a lot of questions about Habitat, 
because I think it’s more documented, but are things that we haven’t talked about that that you 
think are particularly significant, or you’d like to focus on, with Habitat or anything else? 
LD: Hmm. Well, I don’t think so. If I had some time to reflect from now on back at a 
later time, I might, but nothing comes to mind. 
JB: [1:58:25] 
LD: [Laughs] Well, it is. It is. It kind of all fits together. Everybody had their own piece 
of the puzzle, you know, putting it in at different times. It finally began to make sense, and we 
began to make changes within the society. But it was very, very slow. Like, you know, any kind 
of major change in society, it takes a long, long time. But the thing that has been very interesting 
is the Civil Rights Movement has spurred so many other freedom movements outside the

[1:59:43], with women, with other minorities, even with the mentally ill, you know. The Civil 
Rights Movement proved that people could speak out [2:00:00] and demonstrate another way, 
and eventually get to people’s hearts and minds and make real change happen. But sometimes, 
you know, it takes years to put all those pieces together. And I think that, to put it in religious 
terms, we’re all called to different pieces of that puzzle. 
And it was always interesting to me to see how people kind of group together: “We’ll 
work on this.” “We’ll work on that.” “We’ll do this, and we’ll do that, you know,” you know, 
and just how it all evolved. And those patterns that were set on how the Civil Rights Movement 
unfolded is a great pattern, a great illustration, a great template on what kind of work it takes to 
make other change, whether it’s getting people to wear their seatbelt, [laughs] or, you know, 
provide healthcare, you know. There’s a lot of changes that are going on right now in our 
society. It just takes time. It takes people courageously speaking out, making sacrifices. 
EC: So, are those some of the things that you think were most significant about the Civil 
Rights Movement, that being willing to take a stand and speak out? 
LD: Oh, absolutely, people putting their lives on the line. I heard Andrew Young speak 
once, telling some of the stories. I can remember one, in particular, about the March on 
Birmingham, where they used the fire trucks—the fire hoses, and everybody just deciding to sit 
down. They hadn’t planned to do that. It’s just someone started sitting down as a gesture of being 
humble, and they eventually turned those hoses off. 
There are just some powerful stories. I can’t wait to see some of the other interviews. I 
know you’ve already—I’ve watched a couple that have already been posted on the website. 
EC: Yeah. Well, I think it’s going to be a remarkable addition to our history, so I’m really 
glad that we were able to talk with you.

LD: Well, at the beginning, I was more of an observer, kind of taking it all in, being 
educated by my husband’s experiences, opening up to a wider variety of people. And then, my 
contacts with people all over the United States and all over the world, and seeing that everybody, 
you know, has certain things in common, no matter where they are or what color skin or 
whatever culture they come in. I would relate to people even if I couldn’t speak their language. 
You know, I would make gestures towards their children, you know, and I could tell them a little 
bit about my children, you know, and people have grandchildren. 
I’ve heard similar things from the Carters, Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter, how they would 
relate to big important statesmen and stateswomen around the world, is to get down on a real 
common human level. And people really appreciate it. I mean, Millard was so good at this; when 
we would visit, he would make a fool out of himself dancing in Africa. [Laughs] 
EC: [Laughs] 
LD: Oh, he would just make the crowds go berserk, you know, because they had never 
seen a white man making a fool of himself before. They were accustomed to, you know, these 
stiff-shirt, ties, suit, dignitaries, you know, who kind of ordered them around. But we always 
enjoyed getting down on a real human level with people and making them know that we care 
[2:05:00] about them. And I think that’s what’s going to change the world, make it a better place 
for everybody. We enjoyed it! I mean, that was—that became our life, meeting people and 
helping them to make a difference. 
EC: Remarkable. How has it influenced your children? 
LD: Oh, I think that it has greatly impacted them: the experience of us living at Koinonia, 
seeing a different way of life, a very meaningful and deeply religious, a rooted way of life, 
meeting people who were—some were very different, some people who were really weird,

actually, but being able to accept everybody, no matter how different or where they came from, 
and then, the experience overseas, of three years in Africa. 
Our son, in seminary, applied for a job to work in Saudi Arabia, at ARAMCO. He was 
leading the kids of the Americans and Europeans in their summer activities when they were out 
of school. And he got that job, basically, because he had had international living experience. 
There were three others that applied, but he got the job because he had that. And they never meet 
a stranger. Some of our kids have been more engaged in worthwhile church and community 
activities. All four of them are, you know, their own person, and we never have tried to force 
them. They’ve been on builds with us. They’ve started student Habitat groups, or Habitat campus 
chapters they’re called. They’ve been involved with the effort that we started in 2005 after we 
left Habitat, the Fuller Center for Housing. And, you know, we have a daughter-in-law, who is 
actually on staff—helps raise money—for the Fuller Center. They’ve started a group in their 
community. Our daughter out in Texas, who is a homebuilder for very upscale housing, not like 
the ones that we build with Habitat and the Fuller Center, but they got her to lead a Habitat house 
in Benton, Texas. They’ve been involved in different ways, but, you know, they’ve had their 
education, their families, you know, raising their families, and they haven’t done it full time— 
EC: Um-hmm, yeah. 
LD: But each has done something in their own way, you know. 
EC: Is there anything you’d like to add? 
LD: I know there’s probably— 
EC: I know it’s hard to think of everything, isn’t it? 
LD: Some stories. Yeah. [2:08:43] Like a restroom break!
