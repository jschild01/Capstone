[Letter from John A. Lomax; Port Aransas, TX]
February 10, 1939
Mr. John Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax,
I have been unpardonably neglectful in not answering your recent letter. Your information
about the next issue of Cowboy songs and other frontier ballads is indeed pleasant. And
the publisher's advertising circular is most impressive. Thanks for sending me a copy.
The folk songs you enclosed were turned over to Dr. Spivacke who will decide in their
ultimate disposal.
Of course the children got your verses, and liked them. I can report that we had a very
happy Christmas. The fishing possibilities down there must be a great attraction. As for me
— I'm just marking time until the baseball season opens!
In haste, but no less sincerely,
ENW w
