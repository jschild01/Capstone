Philip F. Notarianni: "Rise to Legitimacy: Frank Bonacci as Union Organizer in Carbon County, 
Utah" 
RISE TO LEGITIMA CY. FRANK 
BONA CCI AS UNION ORGANIZER 
IN CARBON COUNTY, UTAH 
BY 
Philip F. Notarianni 
IN THE HISTORY of western United States labor the role of the 
immigrant miner in the unionization of the coal industry has been severe-
ly neglected. During the early twentieth century southern and eastern 
Europeans were funneling into the coal mining regions of theWest. This 
time proved crucial for organized labor as it was the initial period of at-
tempts to organize coal miners into a 
cohesive body. In Utah, however, 
recognition of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) did not 
occur until the 1930s. Thus, from the turn of the century until 1933 the 
union struggled and fought for official recognition. A key factor 
throughout this period of "smoldering unionism" was the role of the 
union organizer and activist. In Utah a 
central figure in the Carbon 
County coal fields was the Italian immigrant Frank Bonacci, who battled 
as a 
UMWA 
organizer and miner. Bonacci struggled within the existing 
economic and political system and moved from one branded as a 
"foreigner" and "radical" to an eventual member of the Utah State 
Legislature. This study will deal with that struggle, and the forces which 
interacted to allow Bonacci's survival and integration into a 
state govern-
ment whose history of labor relations with the coal mining industry had 
been marked by an anti-union bias. 
Frank Bonacci was born in Decollaturg, Province of Catanzaro, Italy 
(southern Italy), on 22 November 1884. He immigrated to the United 
States in August, 1896, and settled in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. In 1898 
Bonacci moved to Michel, British Columbia, Canada. At the age of four-
teen young Bonacci worked as a 
water boy on a 
construction gang for 25` 
a 
day. While at Michel he became a 
member of the Western Federation 
of Miners (WFM) in November, 1903, but in 1905 transferred to the UM-
WA. From 1905 to 1912 Frank Bonacci served on various committees 
and local offices for the union.' Thus, his union experience had been 
tempered within the forges of the American labor movement and the 
more trade unionist attitudes of the UMWA. 
Frank and Filomena Bonacci, with daughter Marianna, moved to Sun-
nyside, Utah in June, 1912, and resided there for five years. In 1917 they 
settled in Helper, Utah where Frank labored for the Denver & Rio 
67 
Grande Railroad. He promptly became a 
member of the International 
Association of Machinists. A 
third move resulted in the Bonaccis' reloca-
tion to the coal camp of Hiawatha in 1918, and in 1919 Frank was elected 
Financial Secretary of the Hiawatha local of the UMWA. 2 
This began Frank Bonacci's role as a 
UMWA advocate on the local 
Carbon County scene. Almost immediately he faced a 
harbinger of the 
future—eviction. In 1918 national UMWA organizers arrived in the 
county. By 1919 coal operators were countering unionization efforts by 
the use of evictions from company land and housing, and the blacklist. 
During the winter the United States Fuel Company at Hiawatha was 
charged with firing men because of union affiliation. Among those 
discharged and removed from company property numbered Frank and 
Filomena Bonacci, and their six children.' 
The oldest Bonacci child, Marian, recalled: 
He had a 
pretty good job, we thought. I 
don't know what happened. I 
guess that his 
activity, the union, they just.... As I 
remember they took the furniture and put it 
out in the street. There was a 
family by the name of Perucci that had a 
store on the 
outskirts of Hiawatha. They took our furniture and moved us in the little place they 
had with them.' 
Forced from Hiawatha in the cold, Bonacci was not totally blacklisted 
and found work in the camp of Kenilworth. 
In late 1919 Frank had been appointed Sub-District Board Member of 
District 15, comprising Colorado and Utah. Upon his arrival to 
Kenilworth he was elected Financial Secretary of the local. The union did 
not win "official" recognition, but the Independent Coal and Coke 
Company had permitted its miners at Kenilworth to organize a 
local, 
which was "perhaps the strongest local in Utah."' 
The 1919 nationwide coal miners' strike skirted the borders of Utah. 
Although some strike activity existed, a 
call from UMWA President 
John L. Lewis instructed John McLennan, national organizer, to 
withhold the strike call from Utah. 6 
This bode well for the public image 
of the UMWA, but internal strife and politics hampered the union's 
ability to organize the Utah coal fields successfully. Financial issues 
precipitated the crises which led H.C. Steward, District 15 Secretary-
Treasurer, to charge McLennan with misappropriating union funds. 
McLennan won the 1920 election as District 15 president, but the lame 
duck district officers attempted to declare the election null and void. 
Failing in this attempt, a 
resolution was passed requesting an in-
vestigating committee be sent to District 15 and if warranted that the 
committee revoke the autonomy of the district.' 
The newly elected officers objected to the move, and at a 
meeting of 
the Executive Board of District 15 charges of malfeasance in office were 
leveled against four prior officers including Board Member Frank 
Bonacci, who was found guilty and discharged.' This action sparked a 
jurisdictional debate in which Bonacci took an active part seeking 
reform. He was a 
strong critic of McLennan, and as the Secretary-
68 
Treasurer of the Hiawatha Local, Bonacci was directly involved in the 
charges of misappropriation of union funds against McLennan.' 
Bonacci, in a 
letter to John L. Lewis, dated 4 
February 1920, ar-
ticulated his views and grievances of District 15. 
I 
am more then [sic] convinced that the only salvation of this dirt is for the Interna-
tional organation to step in and Clean [sic] the whole bunch from office for the time 
being and when in their oppinion [sic] to give the membership another clean election 
because as long as we have a 
bunch of office seakers [sic] knocking one another, 
stealing votes, changing election returns, making trips from one camp to another at 
the expenses [sic] of the national for their election, having local officers to instruct 
the men who to vote for and mark ballots for those not present, and puting [sic] the 
elections campaign ahad [sic] of anything else, I 
do not believe that the affairs of the 
dist will ever prosper to any success. . 
. 
I 
have no confidence in the way the 
business are [sic] managed. Your investigation will find me a 
100% union man and 
not a 
spy as org McLennan and Doran charge me... Since I 
was discharged . 
. 
. 
we can all get work at those two camps [Wattis and Scofield] but we cannot get 
houses, in other camps they have turned me down once, but I 
will have to beg them 
for a 
job now." 
John L. Lewis requested that an investigation be made into the affair. 
The district Committee on Organization found that since Bonacci was 
appointed by the District Board, he could also be discharged by that 
body. The International had no jurisdiction in the matter; however, 
discontent with District 15 officials continued, and on 1 
July 1921 Utah 
was transferred into District 22 which included the Wyoming coal 
fields." 
The new arrangement with District 22 showed great promise, and 
shortly after Utah's inclusion, Frank Bonacci, Secretary-Treasurer of 
Kenilworth Local #4422, became a 
frequent contributor to the Wyoming 
Labor Journal. In August, 1921 Bonacci reflected his optimistic feelings 
to the Journal's editor. 
We hope that in the various camps they [District 22 officials] will receive the same 
cordial welcome as they received at Kenilworth. A resolution was adopted by a 
unanimous vote that local union 4422 of Kenilworth stand by the organization and 
its officers and that we co-operate with them in the necessary work of establishing a 
permanent organization in Utah under the banner of the good old U.M.W. of A." 
Bonacci further conveyed a 
strong confidence in the union, especially in 
the light of the transfer of Utah to the new district. 
A 
grinding loyalty to the UMWA marked Frank Bonacci throughout 
the 1920s. On 1 
April 1922, a 
nationwide coal strike commenced, and the 
Utah experience became a 
bitter affair, with evictions of strikers and the 
role of mine guards prominent in the course of events. Greek strikers 
played a 
principal role, and the "foreign element" was branded as con-
trolling Carbon County. The Utah National Guard was called in June, 
and the strike ended in August with a 
new wage scale of $7.95 per day, 
but no official recognition of the union." Throughout the affair Bonacci 
labored on the local level to secure the union's success, "but all those 
who had taken an active part during the strike did not get their jobs 
back."" 
69 
In January, 1923, he left his family in Spring Glen, near Helper, and 
secured a 
job at Sublette, Wyoming. After several months Bonacci 
returned, worked for the Utah Railway Company, and in November ob-
tained a 
job at the Spring Canyon mine. As Financial Secretary of Helper 
Local #1984 he collected union dues from miners." The town of Helper 
functioned as a 
"city of refuge," a 
haven for banished union men, and 
the local became a 
principal cog in the union wheel. 
During most of the 1920s Bonacci's activities, as well as those of other 
union activists, were closely monitored by a 
labor spying network under 
the control of the Globe Inspection Agency. In February, 1925, Inspec-
tor S.O. 2 
succeeded in meeting Bonacci and Tony Radalj, International 
Executive Board Member from District 22, and reported: 
These fellows told me the purpose of their call was to enlist my aid in this organiza-
tion campaign and also urged that I 
pay up my back dues and get in good standing. I 
complied with the latter request... I 
decided this was the best move to be made if I 
hoped to be able to keep in touch with the union end of it and in position to submit 
first hand information. 16 
Rumors of a 
pending wage cut in February, 1925, added fuel to Bonac-
ci's efforts and productivity. The purchase of a 
new automobile enhanc-
ed his ability of visit more coal camps, and within two weeks he had 
registered some two hundred new members. Inspector S.O. 2 
quoted 
Bonacci as having said, 
'The boys are willing enough to sign up and if I 
had access to all the camps, I 
would 
have them lined up 100% within the next two months. It is simply a 
case of getting in 
and we have to do most of our organizing under cover of darkness. It is an uphill 
fight but as we have friends in most of the camps who we can work through, we will 
soon be in position to make the operators sit up and take notice. "' 
The Globe Agency's reports to the Spring Canyon Coal Company 
resulted in Bonacci's discharge from his job at Spring Canyon in late 
February. Because of his notoriety as an organizer he was unable to 
secure a 
job in the county; consequently, he corresponded with District 
22 officials in Wyoming, who provided him with a 
job collecting union 
dues at $100 per month. 18 The appointment substantiated Bonacci's stan-
ding in good favor with union officers, and their confidence in his 
organizational abilities. 
In March, 1926, Frank Bonacci was labeled the "leading delegate in 
the Utah coal camps." Realizing the difficulty in reaching each man in-
dividually, Bonacci devised a 
plan to have a 
movie, "Growth of 
American Labor," shown at a 
local theater and at the Price City Hall." 
The organizational push prompted a 
call for additional organizers. 
Again, Inspector S.O. 2 
offered some insight into Bonacci's techniques 
by stating the he "always makes it a 
practice to have company in his car 
with him when he goes into a 
camp and I 
have noticed that most of the 
men who make these trips with him are Southern Italians." Bonacci also 
initiated a 
scheme to enlist the aid of established union members whose 
duties would be to provide him a 
list of miners sympathetic to unioniza-
tion. The plan met with favor from a 
co-organizer who had arrived from 
70 
Wyoming. A 
twenty percent reduction in wages was put into effect by the 
Independent Coal & 
Coke Company at the Kenilworth mines. In a 
strike 
conducted by Bonacci the wage scale was restored and the workers 
returned after a 
forty-five day period. 20 
Organization efforts in the late twenties in Utah reflected a 
stagnation. 
Problems plagued the area. In the Spring of 1929 UMWA 
officials had 
pulled Tony Radalj out of Utah because of the expense involved. Bonac-
ci, on the union's guiding spirits, resigned his position because of dire 
economic necessity to support his wife and nine children. This resigna-
tion preceded his renunciation of the union which came under a 
forced 
Yellow Dog Contract. Such a 
contract gave employment on the stipula-
tion that one would not join a 
union, or, if already a 
member, would 
repudiate it." He promptly secured a 
job at the Maple Creek Mine. 
Coincidentally, at this same time Martin Cahill, District 22 president, 
corresponded with John L. Lewis indicating there was "quite a 
bitter 
feeling existing between the American and Foreign Miner," jeopardizing 
organization efforts." Bonacci's absence from the active rolls could ex-
plain, in part, this situation, as well as the circumstances surrounding his 
departure. 
The UMWA's organization impluse reached a 
head in 1933. Their op-
ponents were not the coal operators, as in previous struggles, but the Na-
tional Miners Union (NMU) composed of many card-carrying members 
of the Communist Party. In June, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
signed into law the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). Section 
7(a) of the law affirmed the right of labor to bargain collectively." Thus, 
the stage was set for inter-union rivalry which resulted in a 
bitter conflict 
that cut across community and ethnic lines."' 
Frank Bonacci participated actively in the strike which marked his 
return to the labor ranks. From 1931 to 1933 he had worked for the 
Mutual Coal Comapny and at the Little Standard Mine, but in June of 
1933 Bonacci resumed active union work by becoming field worker for 
the UMWA 
with a 
salary of $125 per month. "s The passage of the NIRA 
prompted his return. With the entrance of Nick Fontecchio, the main 
UMWA 
organizer, Bonacci and other union leaders sought to battle the 
NMU. 
The competiton between the unions exhibited an intense hostility. 
Italians were aligned against one another. On the other hand, Slavic 
miners put aside centuries-old antagonisms based on languages, 
religions, and politics and rallied to the NMU 
.16 While the NMU 
battled 
authorities—the stigma of a 
foreign, communistic union working fiercely 
against it—the UMWA 
engaged in talks with the coal operators." 
Rolla West, the mayor of Price (the county seat of Carbon County), 
himself a 
member of the AFL Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, 
became a 
severe critic of the NMU. He labeled the NMU organizers, 
"three skunks. . 
. 
(with) red stripes down their backs. They are com-
71 
monly known as communists. "38 His position was perhaps typical of 
most county and state officials. West viewed the UMWA as an 
"American" union, unlike the "foreign" union of earlier strike periods. 
Frank Bonacci to West was "a fine man."" Bonacci was an established 
family man, and even though earlier considered radical because of his 
unionism, in 1933, the presence of the NMU tempered that view and 
placed the man and the union in a 
different social and political light. 
By November, 1933, a 
UMWA 
contract was signed with the Utah Coal 
Operators and for the first time Utah coal miners worked under a 
union 
contract. Bonacci sensed pride and gratification in that accomplishment. 
He organized the September, 1933 Labor Day celebration, with a 
reported 3,000 coal miners in attendance. In a 
later assessment of the 
event he noted, 
Who gave us the privilege to celebrate Labor Day in 1933?. [sic] The answer is Presi-
dent Roosevelt and the Democratic party. With the signing of the Recovery Act by 
the President of the United States of America, our union as you know conducted a 
vigorous campaing [sic] and in less than six months we completed the organization." 
A 
new era in the organizer's life had commenced. 
A stamp of legitimacy marked the life and labor of Frank Bonacci 
after 1933. Union affairs continued with Bonacci's rise through the 
ranks. This included: UMWA field worker ($175 per month), 1934; 
C.I.O. (Congress of Industrial Organization) field worker, 1937-1942 
($225 in 1937 to $9 per day plus $4 in expenses in 1941); C.I.O. Regional 
Director in Colorado, 1942; C.I.O. Regional Director for Utah-Nevada, 
1945-1952 ($385 plus $8 per day expenses, 1950); and on 1 
July 1952, 
Bonacci's retirement with a 
$100 per month pension paid by the C.1.O." 
A 
willingness to operate within the system had characterized Bonacci's 
strict adherence to unionism. Under the banner of the Democratic Party 
he entered politics in 1936 as a 
"legitimate" Utah State Representative 
from Carbon County. Support for progressive measures formed the 
hallmark of Bonacci the legislator as it had for Bonacci the organizer. 
Upon election Frank took his seat as a 
member of the House Labor 
Committee. During the 1937 session Bonacci sponsored House Bill No. 
1, enacting improvements to the Workmen's Compensation Act, which 
passed unanimously. He also co-sponsored, with D.A. Tidwell, his Car-
bon County colleague, a 
bill which appropriated funds for the newly 
authorized Carbon College at Price—now the College of Eastern Utah. 
Bonacci voted in favor of measures that granted an 8-hour day portal-to-
portal for underground miners, provided for old age assistance, a 
direct 
primary law, unemployment compensation, and a 
school teacher's retire-
ment law. 72 
Bonacci returned to the House in 1939, 1945 (he had been in Colorado 
from 1942-1943), 1947, 1949, and 1951, representing six full terms and 
four special sessions. Following from his first term, concern was shown 
72 
for most labor-oriented measures." A 1952 House of Representatives 
press release, written by Bonacci, perhaps summed his feeling best. 
Mr. Bonacci has the honor of being the first Italian born to be elected to the Utah 
House of Representatives. This he deem it [sic) a 
great privilege enjoyed only in the 
Good [sic) United States of America. Bonacci became a 
Citizen of the United States 
of America on January 6, 1928 at Price, Utah. He is married and owns his home in 
Helper, Utah." 
Thus, for Frank Bonacci the "American Dream," as articulated in the 
above statement, had reached fruition. An Italian who had become a 
United States Citizen, had served in state government, and who was a 
family-man and home-owner represented the American success story. 
Patience and relentless struggle through adversity characterized 
Bonacci's life as a 
union advocate. This patience he amply demonstrated 
both in the longevity of his union affiliation and active participation, as 
well as in efforts at union reform, resulting in part, in the transfer of 
Utah to District 22 of the UMWA. Commitment to the cause meant fre-
quent evictions from company houses, family crises, and dire economic 
conditions, culminating in the necessity of submitting to the Yellow Dog 
Contract. Yet, patience again manifested itself in Frank Bonacci's per-
sonality, and in 1933, after the UMWA 
victory, he pursued both life and 
labor in a 
context of legitimacy and within the system that he once bat-
tled.
