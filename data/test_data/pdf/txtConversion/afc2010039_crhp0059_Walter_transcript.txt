David Cline: The colors are great. That was a good choice. [Laughs] 
John Bishop: That’s a nice one. And the velvet, you know, absorbs the light so you just 
get the color coming through. 
Mildred Pitts Walter: Oh, great. [Clears throat] 
JB: Okay, David. Do you want to do the slate? 
DC: Okay. So, what I’ll do to start is just introduce who we are, and then we’ll start right 
into the conversation. 
MW: Good. 
DC: If that’s good, okay? This is David Cline for the Smithsonian’s National Museum of 
African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress Civil Rights History Project. 
Today is March the first, 2013, and I’m in San Mateo, California. And today we have the 
pleasure of speaking with Mildred Pitts Walter. Good afternoon!

MW: Good afternoon. 
DC: Thank you so much for participating in this project. We really, really appreciate it. 
MW: Thank you for inviting me to participate. 
DC: So, we will—we’re gonna—I’m on—just for the record, I’m on Channel 2. Mrs. 
Walter is on Channel 1. Okay. And we’ll just start right into it. 
MW: Alright. 
DC: Okay. So, what I’d like to do, if we could just start, if you could tell me a little bit 
about where you were raised and your family. 
MW: I was born in Louisiana in 1922. And my mother and father were together for a 
while. And when Long-Bell Lumber Company left Louisiana, my father was working with them 
in Mississippi, and my mother was still in Louisiana. So, I grew up in a place called DeRidder, 
Louisiana, between Lake Charles and Shreveport, in southwest Louisiana. 
I went to—finished Beauregard Parish High School, where the only new book I ever had 
was the History of the Negro by Carter G. Woodson. All the other books we had had pages torn 
out or marked up, but— 
DC: Can you describe—I’d love to hear a description of the school itself and your 
teachers, what kind of teachers you had. 
MW: Well, we were an all-black school, and the school was finally a pretty nice building. 
Before we had the new school, we were in churches and places. And finally, we had a school 
with a principal who could do electricity and heat, and so we got lights, rather than lamps. And 
this was all in the ’30s and ’40s. And all of our teachers were African American, or at that time, 
we were Negroes. We all were Negroes. And they were really wonderful teachers, and they 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013

helped us to know that we were not inferior. And we took seriously Carter G. Woodson’s history 
that told us about Africa and the nice things about Africa. 
And, of course, we had the church. The church was very important, because the ministers 
and the leaders insisted that we hold our heads high, and we took learning seriously, and 
whatever we did, do it with an attitude of excellence, and to walk and approach those who hated 
us with humility, for humility could not be humiliated. And we learned that and became really 
strong. 
And I made goals and made choices. I worked from the time I was seven. I worked taking 
care of a little white girl for a while, and then, I worked in a beauty shop, cleaning the beauty 
shop, and I worked in homes, cleaning homes and— 
DC: While also going to school? 
MW: While going to high school, um-hmm. And met some very interesting white people 
who seemed to appreciate the fact that I wanted not to just do that always. [0:05:00] 
DC: Hmm, um-hmm. 
MW: And there was one woman who came—Camp Polk was in Leesville not far from 
us. And that was time during World War II, and these soldiers were there, and their wives came. 
And one woman came from Ohio, and she hired me to come and help her. She insisted that I sit 
at the table and eat with her, and I—I just felt—you know. But she was very nice about it. We 
sat, and she talked. And I was a sophomore in college, and she gave me magazines to read and 
insisted—she would talk about what we had read. And when she left, she said to me that I was 
the only person that she felt comfortable with in that place. 
DC: Interesting. Hmm. 
MW: [Laughs] I wish I could remember her name. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
4 
DC: Where was she from initially? 
MW: She was from somewhere in Ohio. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
DC: Yeah, yeah. 
MW: And I’ll tell you later how I learned why the majority of Southerners didn’t let us 
eat together. [Laughs] But she insisted on my doing that. 
Well, I went from there to Southern University in Scotlandville, Louisiana. And I 
finished Southern—well, while I was there, of course, I came in contact with very interesting 
leaders: Mordecai Johnson, W. E. B. Du Bois. All of them came and talked to us and inspired us. 
[Clears throat] And when I left there in 1944, I knew that I couldn’t—well, before that, in 
my senior year, I went up into the state of Washington, Longview, Washington. And I worked in 
the shipyards in Vancouver, Washington, to earn— 
DC: [Laughs] So, how did you end up—how did you end up there, doing that kind of 
work? 
MW: My sister had gone there. [Clears throat] Her husband had moved there, oh, back in 
the ’30s. And she lived in Longview, Washington, and I went there to work in the shipyards to 
earn enough money to finish, to finish Southern. 
DC: Right. 
MW: And I had had a lot of experience in personnel, working with the dean of women, 
so I applied for a job in personnel at the shipyards. And they laughed at me. It was [laughs] very 
highly discriminating, even there, during that time of the war. 
DC: So, what job did you end up doing? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
5 
MW: I ended up cleaning ships, working in gyro rooms and cleaning ships. And my 
manager, my supervisor, felt, she said, “This is not the kind of work for you.” And she tried, but 
nothing happened. 
DC: Um-hmm. You often hear about African American women with jobs during the war, 
the “last hired, first fired.” 
MW: Right! 
DC: What kind of experience did you have? 
MW: Well, I only wanted to be there for a while. But the women who worked with me, 
both black and white, they had children, and we were on the graveyard shift. So, [laughs] I came 
in well-rested, and they would fall asleep. [Laughs] And I would wake them when the supervisor 
was coming, and they appreciated that. 
DC: Um-hmm. So, you were working alongside white women, as well as black women? 
MW: Yeah, white women and black women, yes, uh-huh. 
DC: And how was that? What was that experience like? 
MW: Well, it was a nice experience. They knew that I was a college student. And they 
felt that, you know, I shouldn’t be there and should go back as soon as I could. And I did. I went 
back and graduated at Southern. And when I graduated, with my mother’s blessings, I went to 
L.A. [Los Angeles]. 
DC: Um-hmm. Let me just ask again about Washington. Was that really your first time 
outside of the South? [0:10:00] 
MW: That was my first time out of the South, um-hmm. 
DC: And did that do anything to you, as far as seeing how things were in another part of 
the country? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
6 
MW: Yes. Yes, African Americans were segregated in the little town. They all lived 
together. They went to the same church. And—but they could go to an integrated school. But 
they lived in a segregated neighborhood. But they were very much separated. They didn’t—the 
kids didn’t interchange visits or anything like that, even there, at that time. 
DC: Um-hmm. Did that surprise you? Or did it seem expected, do you think, at that time 
for you? 
MW: Well, I just expected that, [laughs] you know. I didn’t know. I didn’t know what the 
difference should have—well, I felt that it should have been different. But, especially working, I 
thought that I would be able to work, do something different than cleaning ships. But I was very 
lucky that they were finished and didn’t have all of that stuff that caused lung problems. 
JB: Carbon tetrachloride. 
MW: Yes, um-hmm. I was very lucky. Because what we did, we prepared the ships for 
sailing, you know, the first voyage. The first voyage trip, we prepared them for that. And, of 
course, we never went on a voyage. [Laughs] 
DC: [Laughs] Right. Very interesting. 
MW: But I—I saw the ocean for the first time. We went to the Pacific Ocean, and I was 
awed! I thought, “This must be all the water in the world!” [Laughter] And it was such a nice 
experience. Portland, Oregon, was a very beautiful city, lots of roses. It’s the town of roses. My 
brother-in-law would take me to places so that we could see. Mount—oh, that mountain that just 
had the terrible— 
JB: Mount Saint Helen? 
MW: Mount Saint Helen! Was in our back—we could see it from our backdoor. And it 
had snow then, snow on Mount St. Helen all year round. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
7 
JB: It looks different now. 
DC: [Laughs] 
MW: I bet! After that volcanic action. Yes. 
DC: [Coughs] So— 
JB: Let’s pause a second, please. 
DC: Okay. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: We’re back on. 
DC: Okay. So, you graduated, and you were saying, and then decided to move to Los 
Angeles. 
MW: Yes. [Clears throat] I applied for—well, after having worked in Washington, I 
knew that I did not have to work for the amount of money that they were paying in Louisiana for 
teachers. And that was the only—I could have gone to work at Camp Polk in the laundry or 
something like that, but those were the only jobs for college graduates in Louisiana at that time. 
You were either a teacher or a maintenance person. 
So, I applied for a job in Shreveport. They wanted me to teach high school English and 
do the library for fifty dollars a month. And I thought, “No.” And I decided that—and my 
mother—my mother was a very smart woman. And she said, “When you go to college, they 
wash you down, and you change, and you don’t fit in the place.” And I didn’t understand what 
she was saying. I didn’t understand what she was saying, but she knew that at that time, they 
taught us [0:15:00] in these places very differently. And we felt that—we spoke correct English, 
and we didn’t use the dialect. 
DC: Um-hmm. Were there others in your family who had gone to college? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
8 
MW: Not at that time. I was the youngest and the first. 
DC: And the first. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
DC: How many siblings do you have? 
MW: There were seven of us. I had five sisters and one brother. All of that is in that— 
DC: Okay, great. 
MW: But she gave me her blessing and was very happy that I wanted to achieve. But 
now, when I am a mother and as old as I am, I understand what she was saying, and how that can 
make a difference with your parents, especially. She had wanted me to follow in her footsteps 
being a midwife and a healer, and I didn’t want that. 
DC: Um-hmm. So, it’s a bit bittersweet? 
MW: Yes. 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: She had wanted to teach me her methods. She did a—she had a cure for pneumonia 
before penicillin. And it was penicillin, but we didn’t know that. It was definitely penicillin—
when we would put the pigs on the floor, feed them grain, pure mash that would get in their 
hooves and mold. She would boil that, boil them, and give them—the doctor would say to people 
who had pneumonia, “I can’t help you. Go see Mary.” And she would cure them with that tea. 
DC: Very interesting. 
MW: She also used oyster shells, red-hot oyster shells in water, cool that, for kidney 
problems. And they know now that oyster shells have a special medicine that they use now to 
cure kidney infections. She was very—a very smart woman with very little formal education. 
DC: How had she learned her art? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
9 
MW: I don’t know. I really don’t know how she had learned that. But her mother—she 
had a sister who was ten years old at the end of slavery. And she was born in 1890-something. 
So, she probably knew how to go and find the herbs and plants, and she could do that. She could 
go and find plants and knew these plants that could serve as a cure for certain things, and 
especially for women problems. 
DC: Um-hmm. That’s fascinating, yeah. 
MW: Yeah. 
DC: And so, your family saw you off to Los Angeles? [Laughs] 
MW: Los Angeles, [clears throat] yes. And I went to Los Angeles. I knew—I went with a 
high school classmate who had a brother who was living on Skid Row. And we went and stayed 
in a hotel on 5th Street, [laughs] very iffy place in Los Angeles at that time. But a lot of people 
who were transients were there, and I went and stayed there a few days. 
And then I met a woman on the bus. And I told her I had come, just come, to town and I 
thought there would be a YWCA for black women. There was not a YWCA there, and I didn’t 
know what to do. So, she said, “Well, give me a—” she gave me her phone number, said, “If you 
want to—.” Oh, these are my grandchildren! [0:20:00] 
JB: You can come in. 
MW: Oh, wow! 
JB: [0:20:06] 
MW: It’s a video. 
DC: It’s a video, but we can just take a picture. [Laughter] 
MW: Yes, uh-huh. This is [0:20:12], [0:20:15], and this is Earl Lloyd, III. Walter. 
JB: And who are these people? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
10 
MW: These are my great-grandchildren! 
JB: Great-grandchildren! 
MW: Great-grands. 
JB: Gosh, I’ve barely— 
MW: She’s eleven, and he’s seven. 
JB: I’ve barely got to have grandchildren. 
MW: [Laughs] Well, I feel really blessed! These are my great-grands, um-hmm. 
JB: Okay, well, thank you. 
MW: Okay. 
DC: Alright. Say hello to the American people! [Laughter] 
[Recording stops and then resumes.] 
MW: Now, we were in Los Angeles. 
DC: Yeah, and if I could just ask you—I forgot to ask you what year that was when you 
first went. 
MW: That was in 1944 when I went to Los Angeles. 
DC: Great. And you were just saying you had met a woman on the bus. 
MW: Yes. And what happened, I was sitting sort of in the back. And I saw this woman, 
and she looked very intelligent and very friendly. And I had been [clears throat] taught that we 
could trust certain people, and you can tell who you can trust. And I got up and went and sat 
beside her. And she introduced herself and told me a joke when I told her I had just come. 
She said, “Oh, these people are coming in, coming into town.” She said, “And one day, a 
lady was on the bus. And she sat beside a person, and this woman, who had just come in from 
the South, she was eating on the bus. And the lady said, ‘We don’t eat on the bus.’ And she 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
11 
asked the woman, ‘How long you been here?’ And the woman told her she had been there for 
many years. She said, ‘Well, when I’ve been here long as you, I won’t eat on the bus either!’” 
[Laughter] 
And we had a good laugh. And I told her my problem, that I was on Skid Row and I 
didn’t want to be there. And she gave me her phone and said, “Call me if you decide that is not 
where you want to be.” And when I called her, she said I could come and live with her. And she 
had been there for many years and was well known in the community. And she introduced me to 
all of these nice people, to my sorority sisters, and so I was well underway. Um-hmm. And her 
name was Mozella Moore. 
DC: Um-hmm. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
DC: Very interesting. And did you start looking for work then, as well? 
MW: I found work right away. And I worked in—well, I applied for a teaching job. And, 
of course, there were no black teachers in Los Angeles at that time. There was one black high 
school teacher. And I was told that I would have to have a California credential, of course. So, I 
went back to Cal State, L.A., got a credential, and then I was hired as a teacher. 
But first, before that, I was hired as a clerk with the Los Angeles City Schools as a—in 
the Classified Section. And the Classified Section included people who didn’t have certificates. 
There were janitors and clerks, and so I worked as a clerk in the place where they gave the tests 
for classified employees. And that was very interesting. 
And went back to school—well, I met my husband, and we got married. And I went back 
to school and got my credential. And then, I started teaching in elementary school. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
12 
DC: So, can you tell me—I want to ask about your teaching, but can you tell me about 
meeting your husband? 
MW: Yes. One of my sorority sisters took me to a Methodist church. And I remember 
one evening we were having a meeting with young people, [0:25:00] and he walked in. And I 
said to her—he was such an intelligent-looking man—I said, “Who is that man?” And she said, 
“Oh, girl! He has lots of girlfriends! You don’t want to get involved with him.” 
But we spoke, and I found out that he had also graduated from Southern. And I—you 
know, we met, and he became sort of interested, but not—it was not love at first sight, no. No, it 
wasn’t that, because we both were mature. But we were friends. I remember one time I had to do 
a presentation at the church, and I didn’t have a decent dress. And I asked him to loan me some 
money to get a hat and a dress, and he loaned me the money. And when I paid him back, he said, 
“Well, I wasn’t worried because I knew you didn’t want anybody to have anything on you, and 
you’d give me the money back!” [Laughter] And that’s the kind of person he was. 
DC: Right. 
MW: I remember one time we had a meeting with the students from USC, and I made the 
spaghetti and fixed all the food and said the blessing and the prayer. And he was impressed, and 
then, we started seriously growing in love. And we married in 1947, um-hmm. 
DC: And was he already involved with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] at that time? 
MW: Yes, he was involved with CORE and had been since 1942. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: And he was also involved with another organization called Drew, A. M. Drew, and 
they were doing—working against segregation in hotels and motels. 
DC: Okay. Do you know what that stands for, DREW? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
13 
MW: Drew? That was a person’s name. 
DC: Oh, okay, A. M. Drew. 
MW: It was not—it was just an organization started by that man. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: But he was also working with CORE at that time, but not very—it wasn’t very 
much going on. But by 1960, by 1958, CORE was really doing a lot. We were doing stores, 
asking for fair employment, and banks, asking for fair employment. At that time, in our area that 
was predominantly black in Los Angeles, around Central Avenue and in that area, Central Los 
Angeles, banks, stores, and other businesses did not hire us except as maintenance people, 
janitors. 
So, we picketed them and negotiated with them to hire young people who needed no 
more than a high school graduate to do what they were doing, you know, to become sales people 
and box boys. And we insisted that they [clears throat] train them for management, you know. 
And we were very successful with the grocery stores. The banks were very reluctant. But we 
picketed the banks and negotiated with them, and finally they hired tellers and started training 
people for management. 
DC: Who were some of CORE’s allies? I mean, I’m sort of interested in what kinds of 
people worked with you and who CORE worked with. 
MW: We were interracial. When we went into—well, in 1959, Jesse Unruh, who was a 
representative, passed a bill making accommodations—[0:30:00] segregated accommodations 
illegal. So, we had both blacks and whites in CORE. And the ACLU, you know, we were friends 
with people in the ACLU and lawyers and that type of people. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
14 
And we would go out in our car with suitcases and [laughs] the children and go to motels 
and hotels and ask for a room and be denied. And then, the white couple would come after us 
and get a room. And so, we sued those people. We would bring suit against them. And there was 
a young lawyer who did cases for us pro bono, and we had success in suing them, and they 
would finally change. 
Now, of course, I believe that any law that comes about isn’t worth much until it has been 
tested. So, we set out to test that law and were successful in breaking down—I think we did it 
more quickly than it would have happened if we had not done the tests. 
DC: Um-hmm. Can I ask you what drove you? What motivated you? 
MW: Well, I guess I had always—we had always been taught to resist, but we couldn’t 
act overtly. And we did that with just acting humbly and standing tall and facing these people 
without being subservient, you know, yet with humility. And that was instilled in us. And so, 
when I had the opportunity to act openly, it came natural. Just came natural to do this, because I 
knew it was wrong, the way that we were treated. And when I could do something to prevent it, 
it was just a normal thing to do. 
DC: Um-hmm. So, jumping around just a little bit, when you started teaching, what year 
was that that you had your first actual teaching job? 
MW: ’55, 1955. 
DC: ’55. And at that point, how many African Americans were teaching in Los Angeles? 
MW: There were quite a few. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: Um-hmm, yes. There were quite a few teachers. 
DC: So, things had changed? 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
15 
MW: Yes, things had changed a lot when I started teaching. Most of the teachers at my 
school were African Americans—young, very young teachers. And all of the children were 
African Americans; maybe one or two were not. And I can remember one time a little boy, a 
white boy, was there and he got into trouble somehow. And he was in the vice principal’s office, 
and the vice principal said to him, “You don’t have to be here! I will send you to any school you 
want to go! You don’t have to be here!” He didn’t know I was outside listening. And this kid, he 
left. He left. I don’t know where he went. 
DC: Interesting. 
MW: But those are the kinds of things that— 
DC: What was your reaction to that when you heard that? 
MW: My reaction? 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: Well, I just felt that—I didn’t say anything to him, because [laughing] he at one 
time told me that if I didn’t like it here, I should go to another country. Because [laughs] I was—
I was very active and I would put up black people on the wall for the children. Between 
Abraham Lincoln and George Washington on Presidents Day, I would put Frederick Douglass, 
with all his beard— 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: And tell the children about that. And I was active. I was demonstrating then, and 
they knew that. And, of course, I was wearing my hair [laughs] natural. Nobody else was, except, 
I guess, the singer—Abbey Lincoln, the actress, and—what was her name? That singer who did 
folk songs? It’ll come to me. But we were the only three people that I knew who were doing this, 
and it was very disturbing to people for us to begin to do that. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
16 
DC: And what did it symbolize for you? 
MW: For me? 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: Well, I had met—for the first time, I met people who had come from Africa, and 
we were friends. And this woman was so beautiful. And she had her hair short [0:35:00] and not 
pressed, just what we call nappy hair, and I thought how beautiful that was! And I decided I 
would cut my hair and wear it like that. And people wondered why I wanted to do that. They 
thought—I don’t know—but that’s— 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: Yeah. But I did it, and my husband was proud. And sometimes, I would go back 
and straighten it, and he would say—I would say, “Well, people do it,” you know. He said, “But 
that’s not your hair like that.” And I took his word for it and have done it this way since the 
1950s. 
DC: Wow, yeah. So, you were putting up—I just love the image of you putting up 
Frederick Douglass on the wall. 
MW: [Laughs] Yeah, with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. 
DC: Yeah, yeah! And clearly, you know, trying to teach, put some black role models up 
for the students, you know. 
MW: Right! Right. Right. And I did that. And I would put out brown paint, color for the 
children to paint themselves. And that was not popular either, because they didn’t want to think 
of themselves as black and beautiful. But one of the most precious moments for me was one time 
a little girl came while I was teaching and said to me—she was crying, “Teacher, he called me 
black!” And I looked at her and I said, “But you are! You are black and you are beautiful!” 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
17 
And a few days later, somebody called her black, and I heard her say, “Yes, I am! And 
I’m beautiful because Teacher told me so!” And that was a precious moment, precious. She said 
it just like, “I’m beautiful because Teacher told me so.” 
And sometimes they would come in, and I would walk in, and they would say, “Look at 
Teacher’s hair! Look at Teacher’s hair!” You know, punching one another, “Looks just like 
mine!” 
DC: [Laughs] 
MW: You know? 
DC: Um-hmm. 
MW: Um-hmm, made a difference with them. 
DC: Yeah. So, can you tell us a little bit about how that led to your writing? 
MW: Oh, yes. At that time, there were very few books that showed us in a positive 
image. 
DC: Right. 
MW: We had pictures of eating watermelon and red lips and all of that, you know, rings 
in the nose. Now, Du Bois and Langston Hughes had done some books for children, but there 
weren’t many. And I knew a publisher in Los Angeles who did my book, Lillie of Watts. And I 
asked him to publish some books for my children, you know. And he said, “Write them! If you 
write them, I’ll publish them.” And I said, “No, I am not a writer.” 
And he insisted, and I wrote that book, and he published it. And it was reviewed by 
outstanding reviewers, and kind of [0:40:00] heady stuff to be a writer. But I soon learned 
[laughs] after a couple of times that it wasn’t that easy and I got a lot of rejection slips. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
18 
And then one day, I met a young man at Scholastic, who had just graduated from 
Harvard. He was working there, and I had gone in to see a black editor at another place, and she 
sent me to see him. And I went to see him, and he took me—Harvard had just opened up its 
restaurant, its place for women to go and eat, and he took me to go there, and that was very nice. 
[Clears throat] And I told him about a book I wanted to write, and he said, “Write it.” And I 
wrote a book called The Liquid Trap. And they thought maybe this was about alcohol [laughs], 
but it was about these sinkholes in Louisiana, sand traps, you know, where you get caught in the 
sand. 
DC: Yeah! 
MW: And I did that book, and he published it and gave it to—showed it to another editor 
there. And she introduced me to a young editor, Barbara Lalicki. And Barbara was young enough 
to take a risk with an African American writer, so she asked me to write a book. And I wrote 
Ty’s One-Man Band for her, and that was the very first book on Reading Rainbow, Ty’s One-
Man Band. 
DC: Oh, it was? 
MW: Uh-huh. 
DC: Wonderful! 
MW: Uh-huh. And I stayed with her and wrote most of these books with Barbara. 
DC: Were there many African Americans in publishing? 
MW: Not editors. 
DC: Not editors, right. 
MW: Not publishing, no! And I think that is the problem. There are no editors who look 
at our work and can see— 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
19 
DC: Can understand, right. 
MW: And appreciate where we’re coming from. There are some—of course, there are 
white editors who do, but there are no black editors in these major publishing houses, not many. 
DC: Yeah, even now. 
MW: Not many. Not many. And, of course, now we have less than maybe one percent of 
all the books that are published written by and for black children, maybe less than one percent. 
DC: Wow. 
JB: Of all children’s books? 
MW: All children’s books, um-hmm, yeah. 
DC: But you were able to connect with some people that understood this, this vision. 
MW: Oh, yes! Barbara appreciated what I was doing and had—my first book was a 
book—not my first, but My Mama Needs Me was a book about a little boy whose mother had a 
new baby, and he was very worried that she didn’t love him anymore. And he went that—she 
went through that with him, and he would go out, and people would want him to do things away 
from home. And he said, “I can’t. My Mama needs me.” He had to get back. 
JB: I’ve read that one to my grandchildren. 
MW: Oh, really! 
JB: Could you just hold it up maybe? 
MW: Let me see if I can find it. 
JB: It’s this one right here. 
MW: Yes, yes, yes. This book was the one. At first, the illustrator made the characters 
white. And my editor showed it to me, and I said, “No way! No way!” This—I could not do that, 
because my purpose was to have our children see themselves, and I’m sure that’s what most 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
20 
black writers wanted, [0:45:00] for the children to see themselves and their families. And not 
only for black children, but for all children to see us as we are, you know, and to know who we 
are and see us as—now, there was one book early that—The Snowy Day by Jack Keats. 
DC: My daughter’s favorite book. [Laughs] 
MW: Yes, you see? And that was very nice, one of the first. 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: He did that to show these children as normal and healthy and really children. 
DC: Um-hmm, yep. 
MW: And all of my books, though, have a choice, courage, and change. Every character 
has to make choices, and then they have to stand by the choice if it’s a good one. And if they do, 
they will grow. They will change. And everyone has to do that, even in [laughs] My Mama Needs 
Me. 
DC: Right. 
MW: Yes. 
DC: When you were still teaching, did you ever sort of field test the books with the kids 
that you were teaching and bring in your stories? 
MW: No. I went around the country with books. I wasn’t teaching then. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: I was writing and consulting. 
DC: Okay. 
MW: But I would go to schools across the nation and talk to children and read my books 
and got wonderful letters from children, thanking me and telling me how much they enjoyed 
knowing the characters. Um-hmm. So, that was quite a pleasant experience to do the books. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
21 
DC: Right. 
MW: And we won some interesting prizes, Coretta Scott King Award for Justin and the 
Best Biscuits, and— 
JB: We might as well take a plug for these books while we’re at it. 
DC: [Laughs] 
MW: Oh, yeah. This one won the Coretta Scott King Award for the best book. And this 
one won the Christopher, the Catholic Christopher Award, Mississippi—no, not this one. This 
one won Jane Addams notable book. And this one, Coretta Scott King—Mississippi Challenge—
notable book, and the Christopher Best Book Award. 
DC: Can you talk a little bit about that book, which—? 
MW: This book? 
DC: Maybe has a little bit of a, you know, targeted maybe a little bit older audience? 
MW: Yes, this is for young adults. And this also is for young adults. 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: This one is about slavery during the Revolutionary War, and Elizabeth Freeman 
winning her freedom in Massachusetts through the Massachusetts Constitution. And this one is 
for young adults about the 1964 and ’68 Mississippi Challenge, and all about Mississippi and 
how the people in Mississippi had struggled since the beginning of time to free themselves. And 
finally, in 1964, they went to the Democratic National Convention. And Fannie Lou Hamer, with 
President Johnson and all of them, and she had an opportunity to say to them, “We didn’t come 
here to just say, do nothing. We came to take our seats.” And President Johnson promised that 
they would have the time. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
22 
And then, they went back and did all of that legal work to make possible the seating of 
their delegates and, of course, I wrote a piece about that for the Big Book of Peace, which said, 
“There can be [0:50:00] no peace without justice,” and how they went to Washington and stood 
waiting for the Congress to decide whether they would seat them or the white delegation. They 
lost that, but they won. They won, in spite of the fact that they were not seated. And then, they 
came back and did the work that made it possible for the Voting Rights Act to be passed. And 
we’re really concerned today that the right to vote is in danger, here in the 21st century. 
DC: Yeah. What kind of work do you hope that your writing does? 
MW: Well, I hope that it tells children, black and white, all children, that they can make a 
difference. And all of my books point that out, that you do what you feel is right. 
For instance, this book, Alec’s Primer, this young boy was forced to read by a white girl 
in Virginia. And she told him he could go up to Connecticut—I think it was Connecticut—and 
he would be free. But he knew better, and his mother told him that he must not read, because he 
was a slave and he could be sold away from her. But she insisted, and this girl made him read. 
And one day—he got very interested in reading—and one day, the grandmother caught 
him reading. And she tried to take the book away from him; it was a primer. He wouldn’t give it 
up, and she hit him in the face with her riding crop. He still wouldn’t give it up. And his children 
have that primer in Connecticut. 
So, these are the kinds of things that I try to show children—not tell them, but show 
them, that you make choices. And you must, if it is a good choice—and a good choice is what is 
good for all living things, not just for you, but for all living things—when you know that is a 
good choice, then you have courage. And courage will help you to stick with that thing, and you 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
23 
will change. You will grow. And all of my characters show that. And I believe that 
wholeheartedly: that courage will give us that kind of stick-to-itiveness to let us do what is right. 
And that is why I was able to do the kinds of things that I did, like march beside Nazis, 
go to jail, take that risk. Because that’s what making the choice is: Choosing is a risk. I don’t 
want to sound preachy. [Laughs] 
DC: No! No! Not at all. 
JB: You can preach! [Laughter] 
MW: But it is. That’s what choosing is. It’s taking risks. And when you risk, if you have 
the courage, because courage is that kind of thing that comes from being able to listen, listen to 
your heart—not that romantic thing—it’s that inner spirit that guides you to do what is right, and 
you will learn how to go forward or step back at the right moment. And when you learn that, 
then you can grow. You will grow. You will change. And as Lillian Smith used to say, “You 
won’t have status. [0:55:00] You’ll have stature.” 
DC: [Laughs] Yeah. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
JB: Yeah. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
DC: So, we’ve talked about your childhood and then your work in Los Angeles and with 
CORE and teaching and the books. 
MW: Um-hmm. 
DC: How do you see all these things connected? 
MW: Well, I did book reviews for the Los Angeles Times when Johnson made available 
for them to bring out more material for multicultural understanding. And so, I read all of those 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
24 
old books that came back from Du Bois and from—and I was able to do—oh, names are there 
and I can’t call them—the guy who was in prison in South Africa. 
JB: Mandela. 
DC: Mandela. 
MW: Mandela! 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: Mandela’s book, I Will Still Be Moved [Note: I Will Still Be Moved: Reports from 
South Africa, edited by Marion Friedmann]. And I reviewed that book for the Los Angeles Times, 
and all of Du Bois’s books and James Baldwin’s book—well, I didn’t review James Baldwin’s 
book. James Baldwin came to speak for us at CORE, and he had just written that book that 
was—oh, uh, um— 
DC: Go Tell It On the Mountain? 
MW: No, no. 
DC: No? 
MW: Not that one. It was the one that talked about Malcolm X. Oh, I know the book. 
But, anyway, he had just written that book, and the editor at Los Angeles reviewed it, and I 
rebutted his—for CORE— 
DC: Right. 
MW: And I rebutted his review. And he had said that Baldwin was a bigot in writing this 
book. What is that book? But, anyway, I proved from Baldwin’s words that he was not. Because 
if he—I disagreed with some things with Baldwin, but not—I knew he was not a bigot, because 
at the end of his book, he said, “If we, the few that we are, can bring about peace, we can save 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
25 
this nation. We can work to save this nation and give it justice.” And after I did that rebuttal, he 
printed it and he asked me to review books. 
DC: [Laughs] Yeah! Great. 
MW: [Laughs] 
DC: Great. 
MW: And reviewing books, I decided that’s not for me. I need to write. I need to write 
books, not just talk about or criticize other people’s work. Let me try to do something, too. Um-
hmm. So, but I will tell you some exciting moments in my life that I feel— 
JB: Well, let’s hold on for just— 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB: Okay, we’re back. 
MW: Okay. I marched in housing tracts in Los Angeles. And we—they were building 
houses in areas near where a lot of black people lived, and they wouldn’t sell them to us. They 
wouldn’t sell us those houses. So, we picketed them. And I can remember one Saturday we were 
picketing at a place in what is now Carson, California. And everything was going well. We had a 
big line, good line, and there was a Jewish person, Herbert, who had been in a concentration 
camp in Germany, and he was marching with us. He had been very active in CORE; he went on 
the Freedom Rides. 
And, oh, soon, the police came, and they came and stood across the street, watching us. 
And, of course, they always brought tension. But after a while, the tension eased with the police. 
[1:00:00] And then, about four cars drove up, full of white men dressed like Nazis. They had on 
Nazi uniforms, including the swastika. And they had on their signs, their sticks were so big that 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
26 
they could have damaged us with their placards. And their placards read, “Ovens too good for 
niggers,” “Niggers, go back to the trees,” “You monkeys, go back to the trees.” 
And I saw Herbert and I was so—I got worried about him. And I wondered if these 
people would make us lose our stance and become violent, but we had been trained. And finally, 
I saw Herbert leave the line in a staggering way. And I wondered, you know. I was very outraged 
and I wondered if I shouldn’t leave, too. But I stayed and I was questioning myself: “Why am I 
here? Why am I doing this? Why do I want people thinking that I want to live beside white 
people? Why am I here?” 
And somebody started singing, “Oh, Freedom.” This lone voice, “Oh, freedom over me. 
And before I be a slave, I’ll be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free.” And I 
thought, “Well, I’m not here because I want to live beside white people. I’m here because I want 
us to be able to decide where it is we want to live, and we can have the freedom to do that.” And 
I lost my anger and I felt pleased with myself that I had stayed. And I was there with not self-
assertiveness, but there, and was at peace, and was there a long time after the Nazis had gone 
home. 
DC: Um-hmm. 
MW: Um-hmm. And another time, I had been asked to go with a group of artists and 
writers and sculptors to Nigeria to the African Festival of Culture, where all people from the 
Diaspora were coming. And I was the only children’s book writer, so I was able to make a 
presentation. And they were quite pleased that I had come, because they felt that they needed 
more children’s books on the continent. 
But, anyway, I stayed. After Nigeria, I went to Ghana and to other places, Cameroon and 
to Ghana, and looked around. And I felt in many instances, in Ghana especially, they looked at 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
27 
me and they wanted to know, “Who is that woman?” These were some women in the market 
where I was and somebody said, “She’s a Kikuyu. She’s a Kikuyu woman.” They said, “No, I 
don’t think she’s Kikuyu. She might be [1:04:31].” And at that time, I spoke to another lady who 
was not with them, and when they heard my voice, they said, “Oh, my God! She’s a white 
woman!” Oh! So, you can imagine how I felt! 
And it’s amazing—I don’t like to think of that, but I can remember one time when I was 
[1:05:00] a teenager. I was a freshman in college and walking down the street in Louisiana, and 
soldiers were out there, were there. And a white soldier called to his friends in the drugstore and 
said, “Hey! Come see this pretty nigger!” And, for some reason, I got that same feeling there, 
and I don’t why, but when they said, “Oh, my God! She’s a white woman!” She’s not one of us. 
And that’s what they were implying: She’s not one of us. 
So, I went—I knew a great poet there, Kofi Awoonor, and he was gracious to take me to 
Elmina, that castle. And we went to that, and I listened to the people—this young man talk about 
the people who had been in there. And he was like a person who had no—his voice was like 
people do in an ad on TV, you know, no way of connecting. And at that time, we walked up on 
the deck to see the guns and the “Door of No Return.” And when we walked up there, here were 
these men in chains! And at first, I thought, “My God, I’m hallucinating!” Or something. It was a 
prison! 
DC: Wow! 
MW: At that time. 
DC: Wow! 
MW: It was a prison. But so many of us have gone there, they have—I understand that is 
no longer so. So, Kofi and I went and stood on—he wanted me to see those big guns that were 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
28 
trained on the ships so that when the slaves were about to leave, there could be no interference. 
And we went on the Atlantic Ocean and walked on the beach, and I was looking up at those guns 
and listening to the sound of the ocean rolling up, and ocean waves always remind me of the 
blues, for some reason. And I stood there and I looked up at those guns and I thought, “I am not 
African and I am not American.” We had not been allowed to carry the flag at the festival. “And 
I am not protected under the flag of my country.” And I broke down and cried. 
DC: Um. 
MW: And Kofi said, “What is it with you Americans? Every one of you who come here, 
you do that.” And I couldn’t tell him why. But I knew that I’m not African, really, and I’m not 
American. But I have a heritage of Africa and I’m born in America, so I can take the best of both 
cultures and be who I am and become whole. I do not—I am not three-fifths of a person. And I 
thought that there: “I’m not three-fifths of a person,” as the Constitution said. On the shores of 
Africa, I felt this! I am not a potential. I am. And my blackness is not a lack. It is. And I felt that 
I am unique, unique, neither one nor the other. 
And I can understand why Africa does not really know us. It was too painful. We were 
brutally taken away, never heard of again! [1:10:00] Nobody ever returned. And the pain is so 
great you have to suppress that pain and forget. Forget! And now, we’re going back, and they are 
beginning to see we are very much a part of them, very much. 
And, of course, I came back thinking, “I’m unique,” but [laughs] when I came back, I 
couldn’t talk about that to anybody. They might think I’m being arrogant and not wanting to 
identify with my African heritage. And so, I didn’t say—I didn’t talk about it. But I figured not 
knowing—and I didn’t know enough about Africa. Three months in Africa tells you nothing. I 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
29 
didn’t know enough, but what I could do, I could begin to find out more about my heritage and 
about my people, where they had come from, and I did. 
My grandmother came from Guinea, and she was part of the French and ended up in 
Haiti. And from Haiti, after the Toussaint Louverture Revolution, ended up in Louisiana. And I 
can find out more and become fully whole. And I think I’ve done that. I have looked at African 
religions, looked at Christian religion, and philosophies and all of that, and I think I can see 
comparisons between Jesus and my people. And that is why we were able to turn the other cheek 
and walk the second mile. Yes. Yes. 
And I feel that if we can finally really have a discourse about race in this country, as the 
South Africans did for reconciliation, we will become healed. There will be a healing. The 
Kerner Commission recognized that, that we needed to really look at the problem of racism, 
discuss it, but the Kerner Commission was denied, and we fell back into the old ways of doing 
things. And until we can make that reconciliation, we will not be healed. 
DC: What do you think it’s going to take? 
MW: It’s going to take acknowledging it. We as the people who were oppressed, and 
those people who are the relatives and the generations of the oppressors, we are going to have to 
sit down together and really discuss this and acknowledge, acknowledge the pain, because I’m 
sure that there is pain on both sides. You cannot murder, you cannot mistreat, you cannot 
oppress, and not feel guilty. And guilt is very damaging, very damaging. And you cannot be 
treated that way without feeling anger. And anger is very damaging. And we can—we must 
come together and discuss this, the fear that they feel. There’s so much fear of us, and we sense 
that. There’s fear, there’s guilt, and there’s anger, and there is humility [1:15:00] and wanting 
and longing on both sides. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
30 
I have gone to films and I have seen people who have, who are the relatives of those who 
were oppressors mention that when they know their relatives, when they find out that their 
relatives were doing this, they couldn’t walk out of their house for days they were so depressed. 
And they couldn’t talk about it! You see? 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: There’s nobody who would understand, nobody who’s willing to listen. And we’re 
going to have to, I think, come to this reconciliation if we are to become whole and not be so 
afraid that we have to wage wars, have soldiers everywhere. 
JB: Well, [1:16:11] tremendous amount in South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation 
Movement. 
MW: Right. 
JB: I mean, it set up a procedure for doing it and an expectation and had an 
acknowledgement that it’s painful for all the parties. 
MW: That’s right. They did it in South Africa. They did it in Australia. But we cannot do 
it. 
DC: And they tried it in Greensboro, North Carolina. I don’t know if you followed that. 
MW: Yes. 
DC: Yeah, I mean, so there have been attempts. 
MW: Been attempts. And I just hope we can. And, of course, I traveled and went to the 
Soviet Union on a Peace March. 
DC: That’s right, yeah. What was that—? 
MW: And while we were there, every town that we went into—we walked from one 
place to Moscow, and every new place we went into, they’d bring out this huge round loaf of 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
31 
bread and salt. And each person would break bread. And as we broke bread and ate, shared that 
bread, we broke barriers. And while I was there, I began to understand why we were not allowed 
to eat in restaurants and sit with families to eat: It breaks barriers! Breaking bread breaks 
barriers. And there, we broke the barriers and we did not remain strangers or “the other.” We 
were able to really discuss and meet and get along. 
DC: This very basic, very ancient level. 
MW: Yes. And we talked about the need for peace and to do away with atomic bombs, 
nuclear weapons. And while I was there, I was given the Coretta Scott King Award for this book. 
And I sent a letter for acceptance, and my editor read it. And that letter said, “I had to make a 
choice. Would I go on this walk? Or would I stay and go to San Francisco and receive that 
honorable award?” And then I thought about the Coretta Scott King Award and what the children 
would think. And I thought they would appreciate it if I walked for peace rather than go. And I 
made the choice to walk for peace, rather than come to the acceptance. 
DC: Um-hmm. So, maybe we can end with this question, then, connecting to that, you 
know, your work in the Movement, and then, we talked about reconciliation and peace. How do 
you, you know, connect all of these pieces? 
MW: Well, I do feel [clears throat] that there can be no peace without justice. And all of 
the efforts that we made in the ’60s, especially, and throughout our history—we didn’t just start 
working for freedom [1:20:00] in the ’60s, and it wasn’t just Martin Luther King and Fannie Lou 
Hamer and Rosa Parks. It was a lot of young, energetic people and leaders who were killed and 
who were maimed and bombed and—you know? 
So, I do feel that these people who can do this and really change are those who can listen, 
really know how to listen, and listen not thinking about what they are going to say against the 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
32 
person who is talking, but listen and come to an understanding that we are all—we are all one, 
one, and that we must work together to bring peace, peace, to our own lives, to the lives of 
others, to this nation, to the world. And when we really know this, when we know it, we will do 
it. We will do it when we know it. And all the great thinkers have said that: When you know a 
thing, you will do it. Howard Thurman was one of those. Stress that: Know it and do it. 
And I feel that is what has kept me with the faith to try to bring about a message that fits 
our time. All down the history, gospels have changed to fit the time and the need of the people. 
And we need that now. 
DC: Um-hmm. It’s ongoing. It’s ongoing work. 
MW: It’s ongoing. Christianity is an ongoing—it’s ongoing. It is not steady. It is not to 
be accepted or rejected. It is to be carried on to bring about and serve the needs of our time. And 
I think that—I wish I was twenty years younger. [Laughs] 
DC: [Laughs] 
MW: But I’m not. And I feel that my time is— 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: [Pause] Not there. 
DC: Can I ask how old you are today? 
MW: I’m ninety years old this past September. Ninety—September, October, November, 
December, January, February—and six months. Ninety years old and six months. So, you can 
see I don’t have too much, all things being equal, all things being equal. 
DC: Yeah, but— 
JB: A few more books. 
MW: [Laughs] 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
33 
DC: Yeah, a few more books, right. I was going to say, by moving and fighting and—
yeah. 
MW: Yeah. I wish I could get a memoir published, but that’s—it’s hard now. They want 
stuff from celebrities. 
DC: But you’ve done so much, and we’re so grateful for sharing the story with us today. 
MW: Well, I am so grateful for you to listen to my story. I am—I feel blessed and I feel 
honored. 
DC: As do we, so thank you. Thank you. Any last thing you’d like to say before we wrap 
up? That was just beautiful, what you said. 
MW: I would just like to acknowledge my children. I have two sons. I had—I had a son 
to pass away in 2008. He had worked very hard in the Black Studies department at Cal State, 
L.A., and he had done some books for young men. And I have—my younger son is living in 
Santa Monica, California, and he works for the City College there. [1:25:00] He did films. But I 
am very proud of my children. And my grandson, whose children you saw, has been very 
reliable, and he takes good care and sees to it that I’m okay. 
DC: Um-hmm. Is this why you came back to California, to be close to family? 
MW: That’s why. That’s why I came back. And he invited me, along with his wife, who 
you met, and his children. So, that—I feel blessed. Lots of friends and acquaintances. 
Oh, there was one thing I didn’t talk about. In 1970, I worked with a group of peoples of 
color, nurses, and we started that name, “people of color,” rather than “minorities.” We did work 
in the Schools of Nurses. At the time when we were doing this work to bring culture—we 
wanted to get them to know and appreciate the cultures of people of color, which would be 
helpful in making diagnoses. At that time, when they diagnosed shock, cyanosis, and 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
34 
inflammation, they used red, white, and blue, and a lot of us died in shock, because we could not 
turn white, we could not turn red, we could not turn blue. And so, we worked on that. 
DC: Hmm. 
MW: And these nurses gave indications of how to determine that. And we also—at that 
time you could go to visit your people in the hospital between two and four, and we couldn’t go 
because we were working. 
DC: Right. 
MW: And then, they had one set of—one menu—and a lot of the food that they gave, we 
didn’t like. [Laughs] People of color— 
DC: Yep. 
MW: Didn’t eat that kind of food. And there was another thing that we did, too. We had 
it so that during transition, at one time you couldn’t bring children for the end of that period. 
Now, the whole family—we talked about how necessary that was for peoples of color. And now, 
anybody, everybody, during transition, they provide a room where you can go and be with that 
patient during that period. Asian people were suffering from dehydration because at one time 
they would just put ice water on the table and expect people to drink the ice water. They didn’t 
drink ice water. There were so few nurses of Native American we couldn’t get a statistic. And so, 
now, because of this, we added all of this into the textbooks for nurses and made all those 
changes and now we are very pleased that the term “peoples of color” is much more— 
DC: In common usage, yeah. 
MW: Common usage than “minorities.” 
DC: Yeah. 
Mildred Pitts Walter, March 1, 2013 
35 
MW: Um-hmm. So, I did the culture of African Americans. I did the African American 
culture part. 
DC: Part of that. 
MW: For—consulted with the nurses and did that part. 
DC: Yeah. 
MW: Um-hmm, yeah. 
DC: And that was in 1970? 
MW: That was in the ’70s, um-hmm. The Western Interstate Commission on Higher 
Education sponsored that project, and [1:30:00] Dr. Marie Branch was the major nurse who 
headed this project. Um-hmm.
