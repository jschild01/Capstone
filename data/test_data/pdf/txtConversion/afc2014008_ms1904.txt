A few months ago,  Los Siete do la Raza,  a group of Mexican-
American young men, charged with the murder of a highway patrolm an,
 
were being interviewed on a local television program.
 The prisoners
 
were wearing handcu Us; each was asked his name and age.
 One said,
 
"My name is .. . .
 and I
'm 21 years old today."
 "Oh?" the announcer
 
said,  "Well, happy birthday."  The prisoner said,  "Thank you,"
 
and the interview went on.
 No  one seemed to find the exchange
 
at all ironic.
 
The social ubiquity of wishing somone a "hapiy birthday"
 
had actually bumm  become apparent to me  first in quite another
 
context.
 I was lecturing on folk song to an audience of southern
 
Californians and had run down the usual list of folk song charac-
teristics: orally transmitted, existing in free variation, unoffi-
cially sanctioned and so forth -
-
 and then was embarrassed to dis-
cover that I couldn't come up with a,\mEaningful example.
 The
 
standard repertoire was downright misleading, on this level of
 
abstraction, to my audience.
 What I called "folk songs" ("Go
 
Toll Aunt Rhody",  "Down in the Valley" and so forth) they clearly
 
connected with memories of third and fourth grade classrooms in
 
which those songs had been officially taught them from printed
  
schoolM books by a teacher who scolded them if they did not sing
 
them the right way.
 
Suddenly the song "Happy Birthday to You" popped into
 
my heads and, as soon as I mentioned it, the faces in the room
 
cleared.
 Everyone knew it; no one could remember having been
 
"taught" it; each person had heard a variation or two on the basic
 
theme.
 
The more frequently I had occasion to use "Happy Birthday
 
to You" as an exam ple of a "folk song",  the more intrigued  I
 
becam e by its univers lity.
 Considered dispassionately, it is not
 
a very interesting song; besides, in many ways, it is actually
 
uncharacteristic of the general American style of song-writing and
 
song-singing.
 It is excessively redundant, and American songs ten L
 
toward the wordy;;it is most frequently sung by groups and American
 
songs tend w toward solo, both in construction and in performance.
 
It is one of the few songs we ever sing in public; at ball games
 
and conventions even the National Anthem is rarely sung with any
 
fervor, but I have heard an entire restaurant full of diners break
 
spontaneously and loudly into "Happy Birthday to You" when a
 
lighted cake was observed being carried to a table.
 
I even wondered at one point if perhaps there simply
 
weren't any better birthday songs available but a look at a few
 
song,find lists soon disabused me of that notion.
 Hundreds of
 
other birthday songs have been written; we simply never sing them.
 
The hypothesis occurred to me that perhaps the banal text and the
 
bland melody of "Happy Birthday to You" might have some especially
 
elegant fit with the basic American concept of the nature of the
 
birthday celebration.
 Perhaps, in other words, the verbal folk-
lon e item -
-
 the song, which embodies in its text the standard
 
formulaic birthday greeting -
-
 might prove to be a kind of publicly-
stated, group-sponsored paradigm of the really critical elements
 
in the overall social custom.
 
Methodologically, this struck me as a neat and elegant
 
little problem; in practice, it led i
nc into a kind of Golden Bough
 
exploration, winding up some hundred or so pages later with vast
 
quantities of material still uncovered.
 I can only give you a few
 
of the critical points in this report.
 
I began by investigating the history of the song itself.
 
Having never been a disciple of the theory of gesunkenes kulturgut
 
it is annoying to have to admit that "Happy Birthday to You: is
 
an excel lent example of this concept.
 It first appeared, in the
 
form of a parent song,  "Good Morning to All" (a song still known
 
in kindergarten circles) in a volume titled "Song Stories for the
 
Kindergarten and Nursery School" prepared by two maiden school
 
teachers, one of whom was so distinguished that her death, in 1936
 
was noted by a full column obituary in the New York Times.
 
Miss Mildred J. Hill, composer of the team,  is listed in
 
the ASCAP Biographical Dictionary as a "church organist, concert
 
pianist and authority on Negro spirituals".
 I can find no confir-
mation whatever for the latter part of the statement, but she did
 
work with her younger sister, Patty, as a music teacher in the
 
latter's experidmiental kindergarten training school.
 Patty
 
Smith Hill, lyricist, was perhaps a more vigorous woman, clearly
 
possessed of daring, determination and considerable intellectual
 
ability.
 Her formal education ended with her graduation from
 
high school in 1887, at which time she began her life work as a
 
kindergarten teacher.
 A dedicated and unregenerate Dewey-ite,
 
her radical and successful innovations in both curriculum and
 
methodology were so impressive that she was invited to the faculty
 
of TeachersAColumbia, which also awarded her the honorary degree
 
of
' Doct�orx of Letters.
 
"iss Patty" was a president of the Association for
 
Childhood  Education and the first Chairman of the National Asso-
ciation for Nursery Education.
 Her literary output includes
 
"
Fcperimental Studies in Kinderagrten Theory and Practice"
 
and, with Vera Fedievsky,  "Nursery School and Parent Education in
 
Soviet Russia", published in 1936.
 But despite her undoubted pro-
fessional achievements, her most influential literary productions
 
will probably prove to be the two brief songs for which she provided
 
the lyrics:  "Good Morning to All" and "Happy Birthday to You".
 
It'has proven curiously difficult, in fact, impossible,  to
 
determine at just what point after the 1893 publication of Song-
-
toties for the Kindergarten and Primary Schools, Miss Patty set the
 
lyric lines now known as "Happy Birthday to You" to the melody f of
 
"Good Morning to All".
 Since it all happened so relatively rocent y,
 
it is frustrating to discover that apparently nobody ever asked her,
 
or, if they did, she didn't say.
 Given her profession and overalL
 
educational philosophy, it seems likely that the parody lines simply
 
evolved in some kindergarten classroom under her her general aegis.
 
In any event,  the first publication record is not until 1934
 
by Mildred H. and Patty S
. Hill
 
when the "Happy Birthday March",/vd[ 1i
t
tj,iL.
, was printed in
 
sheet Music Form 
Aby
 the Suimny Publishing Company, then of Chicago,
 
wbiab followed, 4 in l935 by the publication of a
 
edition with lyrics.
 
There followed immediately a whole
 
instigated by the Sunimy Company
 
over the problem of copyright infringement,
 
rash
 
of litigations
 
the most prominent being
 
sheet music
 
against Irving Berlin, who had, in all innocence apparently, used
 
Agandx Happy Birthday to You" in a skit in his Broadway Review,
 
As Thousands Cheer. 
The authors of Panama Hattie and The Male
  
Animal also paid up handsomely, and it is to be assumed that Miss
 
Patty's years of retirement were most comfortable indeed.
 
The point is that even as early as 1935 everybody thought
  
"Happy Birthday to You" was a folk song or at least, kRxp
i*g old
 
enough to be in public domain.
 Even the telegraph companies thought
 
SO*
 The singing tel ram service was inaugurated in 1936; t
  .
i !1
  
"Happy Birthday to You" became widely known throughout Western
 
Union as "
the cake taker", and by 1941 it was estimated that it
 
V
 -
 
had been sung at least a million and a half times by the telegraph
 
minstrels.
 
One of the striking features of the story just outlined
 
concerns the overall speed of events.
 In the area of folklore
 
one grows accustomed to thinking in terms of the majestic procession
 
of centuries.
 "Happy Birthday to You" became firmly established as
 
a "folk song" in the popular mind within a period of forty years
 
at the absolute outside limit.
 And if one considers that the
 
"happy birthday" lyric was written some time after 1893 and that
 
the song was fully accepted as a folk song some time before 1933,
 
ten or even twenty years could be shaved off at a cons iervative
 
estimate.
 
I suspect that the historical biases of most folklorists
 
lead us to think of the tradition-establishing process as far more
 
lengthy and cumbersome than it actually is.
 One of the many thing
 
I learned when my children were small was that only by the most
 
agile footwork on my part was I able to avoid establishing tradi-
tions on an almost hour ly basis.
 Man -
-
 the "pattern-maker and
 
the pattern-perceiver" -
-
 starts to wler  at his basic job from the
 
moment of birth.
 
The critical element,  then,  is not the establishment of
 
its
 
a tradition but its dissemination and/acceptance. 
The question
 
of dissemination, or spread, it seems to me has already been
 
taken care of; it is difficult oven to hypothesize two more
 
speedy and effocti o agents of mass circulation than what the
 
Opies call the "
schoolchild underground" and the entire wireless
 
telegraph industry.
 But a song not only has to move; it has also,
 
in a sense,  to stay still.
 It must be remembered.
 
In tackling the problem of mass acceptance,  it seems appro-
priate, first, to scrutinize closely the item being disseminated.
 
Having performed a number of athletic manipulations of the musical
 
by
 
material furnished x x*R the melodic line of "Happy Birthday to YoU'
 
only
 here
 
I should like to report/briefly/that, when Miss Mildred composed
 
her brief tune, she hit spang in the middle of a cluster of American
 
musical norms.
 For o ample, out of twelve of the pertinent charac
 
teristics listed by Jan Philip Schinhan in The Music of the Songs
 
and Ballads in the Frank C. Brown collection, Miss Mildred's tunes
 
conforms to nine exactly and well within range on three.  In other
 
words, she was successful in writing a melody which most Americans
 
can feel comfortable singing, since it falls well within the di-
mensions of our overall patterning of what a tune "ought" to be.
 
The same thing cannot be said, exactly, of the lyrics,
 
which are not only rudimentary but which make the same statement
 
four times hand-running with only one slight variation.
 Some degree
 
of repetition, of course, characterizes all oral literature; but
 
4 w1
 
some genres and some societies seem to
 It more than others.
 
Overall, redundancy does not seem to be a stressed characterizer
 
of American song style -
-
 the very existence of the ballad as an
 
important song form indicates otherwise.
 The extent of the re-
dundancy in the lyric of "Happy Birthday to You" may then indicate
 
Xkzxxkk either that the Misses Hill were playing about with the non-
normal (as all creative people must do to some extent) or else that
 
the redundant statement is simply so important that it can stand
 
being repeated four times.

If one stops laughing and really takes a hard look at the
 
verbal content of the statement,  "Happy birthday to you", one is
 
struck by what a limited remark it is.
 Roo It contains no whisper
 
of past or of future; no congratulations; no good wishes beyond the
 
day.
 Yesterday, you could have done something hateful or magnif
 1-
Mayx
 
cent, cowa rdly or great-hearted; tomorrow,  I may wish you either
 
well or ill.
 Today -
-
 and today only -
-
 you get a happy birthday.
 
This highly restricted statement is also directed towards
 
only one individual, ba virtue of the song's inclusion, as the only
 
departure from almost total redundancy, of the name of the particular
 
birthday celebrant.
 Indeed, on occasions when the song is sung by
 
a group, each person singing tends to use the name by which he nor-
m
nally addresses the individual in direct conversation.
 The resul-
tant cacaphonys  "Happy birthday, dear Daddy, John, Grandpa, Uncle
 
John" makes even more explicit the essential function of the lyric
 
line; to convey a rigorously limited statement from a single indi-
vidual to another single individual.
 
But -
-
 paradoxically  the song as a whole is admirably
 
adapted to group singing and, indeed, is most frequently kox sung
 
by groups.
 The repetitive txt, the absence of difficult articu-
lations or vocal leaps,  the restricted 
1 range,  the four-square metric
 
construction stand in sharp contrast to the individualistic content
 
of the lyric's message.
 Perhaps, then, one of the reasons for the
 
song's remarkable attractiveness to Americans is that it presents
 
a paradigm of one of the principal ways that we tend to think of
 
groups -
-
 as temporary assemblages of discrete units, co-incidental
 
collections of separate and distinct individuals.
 
It is instructive, in passing, to see what happens to this
 
limited sentiment when it is
 translated into
 
other languages, for "Happy Birthday to You" is on the way to be-
coming an international song.
 I have no evidence as to how widely
 
it is sung or how popular it'is and I suspect that some of its
 
translations are the work of missionaries and the like; still, the
 
song does exist in tongues as improbable as Tagalog and
 
£

In Spanish speaking countries, one sings,  "Feliz cumple-
anos para ti" and it is significant that the term "cumpleanos"
 
(
in contrast to "aniversario" or "natividad" is translatable as
 
-
-
 a clear suggeslion of the past.
 
"completion of many years"/  In Holland, one i
am sings forthrightly
 
"Long may he live, long may he live, long may he live in prosperi-
ty, hip hip hooray!"  In 19we, the song goes "May birthday's
 
blessings be yours, may many more years be yours, one year after
 
another, may God bless you."
 
Throughout the 25 or so translations I have been able to
 
accumulate, one observes simply more linguistic content than the
 
original; they are more complex, less redundant, and all contain
 
references to past or future, or both.
 None speak of the birthday
 
in the same isolated way that the American version does -
-
 as
 
though the birthday were a frozen chunk of time, a spatially sep-
arate twenty-four hour unit.
 
The restricted nature of the American message, on the
 
other hand -
-
 "I (
independently) wish you (individually) a ri-
gorously limited time period (24 hours, no more, no less) o6
 
"happiness" without reference to what you have accomplished in
 
the past nor what you may do in future" -
-
 explains why Americans
 
can, with perfect aplomb and a complete absence of irony, wish
 
a pri soner in chains a "happy birthday".
 It is also why we can
 
sit in a restaurant and sing "Happy Birthday to You" to some total
 
stranger we can't even see across the room.
 There's nothing per-
sonal about it at all.
 To Americans, every dog has his day, and
 
every human being gets a birthday, once a year.
 All you have to
 
do is be alive at the right time.
 
I
s that what we're celebrating?  I
s that -
-
 as has been
 
said in another connection -
-
 all there is?  Well,  that's what
 
the song says -
-
 and I think it's right.
 Many people have spoken
 
of the birthday under the general anthropological category of a
 
k 4'-
 -  A1 .
.,-
 L1T
 
rite of passage  b 
A  Ot I believe this to be in error.
 Certainly the
 
overall fort of the celebration suggests a passing rite; however,
 
several distinctive features of the birthday concept suggest other-
wise.
 For one thing, the birthday celebrant is not expected to
 
be himself altered by the experience, nor is his social condition
 
any different than before.
 Secondly, the condition of having a
 
birthday is neither achieved by the individual nor conferred by th
 
society; it simply occurs annually throughout the life span.
 
Thes the birthday appears to function as a ceremonial of
 
individual social recognition.
 Once a year,  Americans seem to
 
feel a social coinuplsion to say to each person separately: you
 
are alive;  I greet you;  I hope you're happy about it all.
 
The limitations, the "lack" of si L l content of the
 
birthday message bocor
ne't
dy'very important.
 It  life itself -
-
the simple condition of being alive rather than dead -
-
 is what
 
is being celebrated,  then you can't qualify it.
 Great deeds and
 
noble accomplishments have nothing to do with it.
 It is the
 
very impersonality of the birthday wish, indeed, that makes its
 
fundamental humanism possible.
 You neither have to know nor like
 
the indiqidual to be able to honor the fact that he exists, if
 
that's all you're doing; nor do you have to feel you must wish
 
him well in future.
 The day after his birthday, he can fall and
 
break a leg, or you can do him down in a business deal, or coin-
pletely ignore his existence.
 But on his birthday, he is there;
 
and attention must  be paid.
 
Like all Americans,  I have been watching in distress the
 
increasing upheavals within our society in recent years.
 I support
 
most of the social goals at stake,  but my fear has been that in our
 
struggles we may irreparably damage the cultural fabric that has
 
held the country together.
 It is a fabric made up of subtly inter-
woven and complex cultural compromises; and where the birthday
 
fits in, it'seems to me,  is as a mediating influence between two
 
very contradictory aspects of our society: our fundamental and very
 
deep-seated egalitarianism (
still,  I believe, a strong force in
 
American XkzxzkgX thought) and our insistence on unrestrained com-
petitive individualism.
 
The two don't fit together very comfortably, as the his-
tory of the United States over the past two hundred years has
 
shown.
 But the birthday ceremonial xacx and its associated song
 
says: every year, every citizen, good, bad or indifferent, must be
 
honored by his society for the fact of his simple existence as a
 
social unit.
 There is,  it seems to me, a kind of reluctant nobility
 
concept here.
 I hope it survives.
 
And so, this seems to i
nc to be why all Americans know and
 
sing "Happy Birthday to You".
 It is brief and undemanding -
-
 as
 
a "ceremonial'  song, it's a joke -
-
 but it is one of our few songs
 
constructed Is for a group to sing to an individual, which is what
 
we want to do on a birthday.
 It is not sentim ental nor poetically
 
conceived, and we would be publiely embarrassed if it were.
 It is
 
as tight-lipped and as dead-pan and as flatly democratic as the
 
millions of Americans who sing it each year.
 And above all,  it
 
says, ex actly and precisely -
-
 no more and no less -
-
 just what
 
we want to say.
 For if it said any more,  it could not say as
 
much: happy birthday to you.

of centuries.
 
"Happy Birthday to You" became firmly established as
 
a "folk song" in the popular mind within a period of forty years
 
n
: the absolute outside limit.
 And if one considers that the
 
"happy birthday" lyric was written some time after 1893 and that
 
the song was fully accepted as a folk s o ng  some time before 1933,
 
ten or even twenty years could be shaved off at a cons ervative
 
suspect that the historical biases of most folklorists
 
lead us to think of the tradition-establishing process as far more
 
lengthy and cumbersome than it actually is.
 One of the many thing
 
I learned when my children were small was that only by the most
 
agile footwork on my part was I able to avoid establishing tradi-
tions on an almost hourKly basis.

The critical e
ein e n t,
 then,  is not the establishment of
 
its
 
a tradition but its dissemination and/acceptance. 
The question
 
of dissemination, or spread, it seems to i

taken care of; it is difficult even to hypothesize two more

In tackling the problem of mass acceptance,  it seems appro-

I should like to report/briefly/that, when Miss Mildred composed
 
her brief tune, she hit spang in the middle of a cluster of American
 
musical norms.
 For e ample, out of twelve of the pertinent charac
 
teristics l
isted by Jan Philip Schinhan in The Music of the Songs
 
.
nd Ballads in the Frank C.  Brown collection, Miss Mildred's tunes
 
conforms to nine exactly and well within range on three.  In other
 
words, she was successful in writing a melody which most Americins
 
feel comfortable singing, since -it fal's well within the (Ut--
 
'Hons of our overall patterning of what a tune "ought" to be.
 
The same thing cannot be said, exactly, of the lyrics,
 
which are not only rudimentary but which make the same statement
 
four times hand-running with only one slight variation.

of repetition, of course, characterizes all oral l
iteral:ure;  hut:
 
some genres and some societies seem to ,
 it more than others.
 
Overall, redundancy does not seem to be a stressed characterizer
 
of American song style -
-
 the very existence of the ballad as
 
a
 i
i
 
important song form indicates otherwise.
 The extent of the re-
dundancy in the lyric of "Happy Birthday to You" may then indicate
 
either that the Misses Hill were playinp about with the non-
normal (as all creative people must do to some extent) or else that
 
the redundant statement is simply so important that it can stand
 
being repeated four times.
 F
irs
 
If one stops laughing and really takes a hard look at the
 
verbal content of the statement,  "Happy birthday to you", one i
s
 
struck by what a limited remark it is.
 Rug It contains no whisper
 
of past or of future; no con ratu ation  ; no
 wi shos beyond t n
 
day.
 '
i
'esterday, you could have done something hateful or i
r
'a nifi-
cent, cowa rdly or great-hearted; tomorrow,  I may wish yo  e
it!
 
well or ill.
 Today -
-
 and today only -
-
 you got a happy birthday.
 
This highly restricted statement is also directed towards
 
only one individual, by virtue of the song's inclusion, as the only
 
departure from almost total redundancy, of the name of the particul?r
 
birthday celebrant.
 Indeed, on occasions when the song is sung by
 
a group, each person singing tends to use the name by which he nor-
mally addresses the individual in direct conversation.
 The resul-
tant cacaphony;  "Happy birthday, dear Daddy, John, Grandpa, Unc e
 
John" makes even more explicit the essential function of the lyric
 
line; to convey a rigorously limited statement from a single indi-
vidual to another single individual.
 
But -
-
 paradoxically  the song as a whole is admirably
 
adapted  to group singing and, indeed, is most frequently h a sung
 
by groups.
 The repetitive text, the absence of difficult articu-
lations or vocal leaps,  the restricted 
1 range,  the four-square metric
 
construction stand in sharp contrast to the individualistic content
 
of the lyric's message.
 Perhaps,  then, one of the reasons for the
 
song's remarkable attractiveness to Americans is that it presents
 
a paradigm of one of the principal ways that we tend to think of
 
groups -
-
 as temporary assem blages of discrete units, co-incidentnl
 
collections of separate and distinct individuals.
 
I
t is instructive, in passing, to see what happens to this
 
lUnited sentiment when it is
 xk øxtRgx translated into
 
other languages, for "Happy Birthday to You" is on the way to he-
coining an international song.
 I have no evidence as to how widely
 
it is sung or how popular it is and I suspect that some of its
 
translations are the work of missionaries and the like; still,  the
 
song does exist in tongues as improbable as Tagalo  and

 None speak of the birthday
 
in the same isolated way that the American version does -
-
 as
 
though the birthday were a frozen chunk of time, a spatially sep-
arate twenty-four hour unit.
 
The restricted nature of the American message, on the
 
other hand -
-
 "I (
independently) wish you (individually) a ri-
gorously limited time period (24 hours, no more, no loss) o
 
"happiness" without reference to what you have accomplished in
 
the past nor what you may do in future" -
-
 explains why Americans
 
can, with perfect aplomb and a complete absence of irony, wish
 
a pri soner in chains a "happy birthday".
 It is also why we can
 
sit in a restaurant and sing "Happy Birthday to You" to some total
 
stranger we can't even see across the room.
 There's nothing per-
sonal about it at all.
 To Americans, every dog has his day, and
 
every human being gets a birthday, once a year.

 as has  been
 
said in another connection -

the song says -

 and I think it's right.
 Many people have spoken
 
of the birthday under the general anthropological category of a

rite of passage  bot I believe this to be in error.
 Certainly the
 
I'.
 
overall form of the celebration suggests a passi n
 rite; however,
 
several distinctive features of the .
birthday concept suggest other
-
wise.
 For one thing, the birthday celebrant is not expected to
 
he himself altered by the experience, nor is his social condition
 
any different than before.
 Secondly, the condition of having a
 
birthday is neither achieved by the individual nor conferred by t
:
h
 
society; it simply occurs annually throughout the life span.
 
a
 
Thes the birthday appears to funCtion as  a  ceremoni al  of
 
individual social recognition.
 (
:nce a year,
 n
ericans seem to
 
feel a social coinupision to say to each person separately: y o u
 
are alive;  I greet you;  I hope you're happy about it all.
 
The limitations, the "
lack" of goodnd content of the
 
birthday message become 4 �

 is what:

: •
 Creat deeds and
 
noble accomplishments have nothing to do w.th i
t.
 t is the
 
very impersonality of the birthday wish, indeed, that makes its
 
fundamental humanism possible.
 You neither have to know nor l
ike
 
the indigidual to be able to honor the fact that he exists, jr
 
t
hat's all you're doing; nor do you have to feel you must wish
 
him well in future.
 The day after his birthday, he can fall an 
break a leg, or you can do him down in a business deal, or
 
pletely i'
,nore his existence.

increasing upheavals within our society in recent years.
 I support:
 
m os t  of the social goals at stake, but my fear has been that in our
 
truggles we may irreparably damage the cultural fabric that has
 
country together.
 It is a fabric made up of subtly inter-
complex cultural comprom ises; and where the birthday
 
f
its in, it seems to me, is as a mediating influence  het:weer
,  two
 
very contradictory aspects of our society: our f
h
iridamontal and very
 
deep-seated egalitarianism (
still,  I believe, a strong force in
 
American XkxxxkgX thought) and our  insistence on unrestrained  com-
petitive individualism.
 
The two don't fit together very comfortably, as  the his-
tory of the United States over the past two hundred years has
 
shown.
 But the birthday ceremonial
 and its associated so:IA
 
says: every year, every citizen, good, bad or indifferent, must b
c
 
honored by his society for the fact of his simple existence as a
 
social unit.
 There is, it seems to i
ne,  a kind of reluctant  nohilitf
 
concept here.
 I hope it survives.
 
And so, this seems to i
nc to be why all  \
m
nericans know and
 
sing "Happy Birthday to You".
 It is brief and undemandiny -
-
 as
 
a "ceremonial" song, it's a joke -
-
 but it is one of our few songs
 
constructed to for a group to sing to an individual, which is what
 
we want to do on a birthday.
 It is not sentimental nor poetically
 
conceived, and we would be publiely embarrassed if it were.
 It
: is
 
as tight-lipped and as dead-pan and as flatly democratic as the
 
millions of Americans who sing it each year.
 And above all,  it
 
says, excactly and precisely -
-
 no more and i
to less -
-
 just  7
hat
 
we want to say.
 For if it said any more,  it could
, not say as
 
much: happy birthday  to  you.
