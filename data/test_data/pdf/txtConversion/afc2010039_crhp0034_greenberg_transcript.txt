John Bishop:  Okay, this is room tone.  There’s fan noise, um, in the building we can’t 
get rid of, so I’m going with the room tone.  [Pause] Okay, that’s good. 
Joe Mosnier:  Uh, today is Monday, July 18, 2011.  My name is Joe Mosnier of the 
Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  I am in 
Midtown, Manhattan, with, uh, videographer John Bishop to do an oral history interview for the 
Civil Rights History Project, which is an undertaking of the Library of Congress and the 
Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.  And we’re just really 
delighted and honored to be with you, today, Professor Jack Greenberg, um, to talk about, um, 
some very, very interesting civil rights history and your role in a lot of that history.  So, thanks 
for meeting with us.

I thought I might start and have you just talk a little bit about how you, um, evaluated the 
choice to join the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] as a 
law school graduate in ’49. 
Jack Greenberg:  Well, implicitly, I really made that choice before ’49.  Um, I started at 
Columbia Law School with no thought of being a civil rights lawyer.  Because there was no such 
thing.  I thought I would maybe do labor law or things that later would come under the label of 
civil rights.  But I had a professor at the time, Walter Gellhorn, who gave a seminar, which he 
called Legal Survey.  And in Legal Survey students worked for civil liberty, civil rights lawyers.  
Again, that label really didn’t attach to anyone at that time.  It was sort of a precursor of clinical 
legal education.  We were working on real cases.  And I saw this course, uh, listed on the bulletin 
board and I immediately ran – I still can recall running up two flights of stairs to Professor 
Gellhorn’s office to become enrolled in the course. 
A curious bit of history that the Smithsonian would be interested in is why he named it 
Legal Survey.  He said if he called it Civil Rights or Civil Liberties the faculty might not permit 
him to teach it, because in those days, if you were a civil libertarian or a civil rights advocate, 
you ran the risk of being called a Communist.  And, in fact, Professor Gellhorn himself was 
summoned down to Congress on two occasions to swear, “I have not – I am not and never have 
been a member of the Communist Party.” 
So, I took his course, and since the subject matter of the course was changed from week 
to week, depending on the cases you were working on, I took it for four semesters.  I became 
chairman of the student body taking that course.  Uh, after I got out of law school – well, to 
make the long story very short, I had worked on some Legal Defense Fund cases. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 3 of 22 
 
And there weren’t a lot of lawyers doing that.  The Legal Defense Fund at that time had 
three or four other lawyers.  The American Civil Liberties Union, which now has hundreds of 
lawyers, had a single lawyer.  There were three Jewish organizations that, respectively, had three 
and one and one lawyers.  And that’s all there was in the whole U.S., except some individual 
lawyers who handled some civil rights cases. 
Anyway, one of the lawyers at the Legal Defense Fund, her name was Marian [Wynn] 
Perry, was married to a doctor who became – had some, got some official position with New 
York State that required him to be in Albany, New York.  And so, she resigned, and there was an 
opening.  And Thurgood Marshall asked, uh, Walter Gellhorn to recommend somebody, and he 
recommended me. 
And so, that’s how I got there.  So, I was – had a disposition to do it, because I took this 
seminar for four semesters, but I hadn’t planned to do it.  It was not exactly planned for a career 
in which there were six lawyers in the whole country doing it. 
JM:  [Laughing] Right.  [5:00] 
JB:  I’m just going to pause for a sec. 
JM:  Let’s stop for just a minute. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Okay. 
JM:  Okay, we’re back after a short break.  Professor Greenberg, I thought I, uh, would 
extend the theme by asking you to describe that, um, that small band of Legal Defense Fund 
attorneys, obviously under Thurgood Marshall’s direction, there in ’49 when you joined.  As you 
say, it’s just a couple of folks. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 4 of 22 
 
JG:  Right.  There was Thurgood, who even at that point had become a national figure, 
because he had won the, uh, restrictive covenant cases, which I’ll describe if you ask me to.  
He’d won some of the big voting rights cases, also.  Um, his first assistant was Bob Carter, who 
was a judge here in New York, [at the time, retired].  Another fellow called Franklin Williams, 
who later went on to another position in the NAACP and then became ambassador to Ghana and 
the head of a foundation, Phelps Stokes Foundation.  Uh, that was it.  And there was me. 
There was also a woman there who was a fulltime sociologist.  I’m sure the only law 
office in the world that had a sociologist on its staff.  And that was it. 
JM:  Um-hmm, um-hmm.  Um, can you –? 
JG:  At that time, I might say, we were part of the NAACP.  We were, uh, a separate and 
independent part.  Well, the independence caused some tension between Thurgood and Walter 
White, who was head of the NAACP, but nevertheless, independent.  And in 1957, for reasons 
related to tax exemption, we spun off and became entirely independent as the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. 
JM:  Right. 
JG:  And that later created some different kinds of tensions. 
JM:  [Laughs] Right.  Yeah.  Let me ask, uh, as a, as a young lawyer you, uh, you were 
very quickly in the midst of a lot of, uh, of very significant litigation in schools and – particularly 
in schools obviously in the early ’50s.  Um, I think you and Bob Carter tried the Kansas schools 
case out in Topeka. 
JG:  That’s right. 
JM:  Yeah.  Can you share some recollections of that experience? 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 5 of 22 
 
JG:  Oh, yeah.  Well, the things you remember about the case are not the important 
things, because the important things are part of history, so you don’t have to really mention it 
again.  But the Kansas – Kansas had a peculiar statute.  It was an optional segregation statute.  In 
most of the Deep South, the schools were required to be segregated by law.  In Kansas, high 
schools or high school systems could opt to be segregated, and Kansas had taken that option. 
Uh, we tried the case on two different tracks, as we did all the other cases; that is, to show 
that the black schools were not equal to the white schools in what you might call tangible, 
measurable respects – number of books, teachers’ salaries, number of square feet, gymnasium, 
playing ground, curriculum, laboratories, things like that.  Um, but then, we also tried it on the 
basis of [phone rings in background] urging the court, with the help of expert witnesses, to 
understand that segregation itself constituted an inequality.  [Someone can be heard answering 
phone, conversing] 
JM:  Exactly.  Um, I know you probably have told this story many times, but let me ask 
you just to, just to recall your, um, reaction when the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of 
Education of Topeka] finally came down in May of ’54. 
JG:  Well, that was a long time from the argument.  You were talking about the argument, 
which was in ’51, really, and then it was appealed to the Supreme Court in ’52, and then argued 
two more times after that.  Uh, well, everybody was kind of stunned by it.  We’ve won lots of 
cases before and since, and there were big raucous celebrations.  And it was just a silence 
descending on everybody.  I think stunned is the only word.  A cosmic decision. 
JM:  Yeah. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 6 of 22 
 
JG:  And later turned out to be even more cosmic than we’d understood.  We brought a 
case to challenge school segregation.  [10:00] It turned out the decision swept away all state-
imposed segregation. 
JM:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were, um – were you surprised by the vehemence of the pattern 
of reaction that arose in the late ’50s across the South to early efforts to desegregate schools? 
JG:  That’s right.  Other cases like that had been won, involving, uh, higher education, 
law schools, graduate schools, voting; and then in lower courts, things like golf courses, beaches, 
theaters.  Uh, and, uh, there was sort of grudging acceptance of those.  And the cases, those 
earlier cases, did not involve any vast numbers of people.  The higher education cases involved 
one or two people.  But integrating school systems involved large numbers and, more horrible to 
the segregationists, were men and women going to school together, and boys and girls.  The 
biggest taboo was any kind of contact between the sexes. 
JM:  Yeah.  I’m interested to have you, um, talk a little bit about how you measured the 
landscape of possibility when you became director-counsel in ’61. 
JG:  Well, by then, a lot of things had happened.  In ’61, the, uh, Civil Rights Movement 
had begun, and students were being – sitting in in North Carolina, as you well know, and 
elsewhere in the South, and it was picking up like wildfire all over the country.  And they were 
being arrested, and there were no ready defenses for them, because it had never been necessary 
to defend anybody against anything like that.  Uh, but we – we understood the Constitution and 
legal landscape pretty well, and so we were ready with a bunch of defenses. 
JM:  Um – 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 7 of 22 
 
JG:  And we, I might say, we ended up by the time the Civil Rights Movement – I don’t 
know that it ever ended, but by the time it reached some measurable stopping point, we’d 
represented about thirty-five hundred people and got them all acquitted. 
JM:  Yeah.  I neglected, as we were talking there for a minute about the late ’50s, I 
wanted to ask and have you, um, describe – you published in ’59 Race Relations in American 
Law. 
JG:  That’s right. 
JM:  Which, which was an unprecedented volume.  Can you talk a little bit about the 
effort to, to, to do that work, to, to do that volume, and, and what you were trying to do with it? 
JG:  Well, I, a lot of these things, you know, you don’t have any ambitions beyond the 
thing itself, because you can’t, you can’t tell what’s going to happen.  But I was practicing civil 
rights law, and I was impressed by the fact that there was no book on civil rights law.  And I was 
handling cases in all the areas that the book covered.  And, essentially, I took my knowledge of 
those cases and put them into the book, which was the first volume on civil rights law since 
about 1919. 
JM:  What reaction did the book receive? 
JG:  It was curious in some ways.  Uh, it got excellent reviews, but it was considered to 
be a, uh, a hot topic.  For example, the Columbia Law Review did something I haven’t seen them 
do, or any other law review, before or since.  They published a pro and an anti review, as if it 
were a controversial subject. 
Uh, and then, there was, uh, there were some academics who had expressed views on 
civil rights.  Uh, there was one, uh – Herbert Wechsler wrote a famous article called “On Neutral 
Principles of Civil Rights Law.”  Then there was a legal philosopher at NYU called Edmund 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 8 of 22 
 
Cahn, who wrote a book, uh, an article anyway, attacking the Brown decision for its use of social 
science data.  Anyway, I didn’t see how he could have anything against what I had written 
[15:00] and it would be quite a coup to get him to review the book.  So, I sent him a copy and 
asked whether he would do a review. 
And he called me and asked me to come to his office.  And he said that he wanted me to 
know that he thought the book was an excellent book.  But he didn’t see how he could review it 
objectively because his son, and he was white, had married a black woman.  I said, well, I didn’t 
think that should make any difference.  Well, he didn’t want to do it. 
JM:  Hmm, fascinating.  Wow, yeah.  Um, can you – moving again to the [clears throat] 
early ’60s, you’ve written and kind of used the phrase that the Movement in some respects in 
those – after February 1960, really shifted from the courts and into the streets there for many 
years. 
JG:  Oh, yeah? 
JM:  And, um, of course, you traveled extensively – had been traveling extensively from 
New York from the time you joined the LDF.  Are there any, um, episodes or memories that 
really stand out in your mind as exemplary or, um, particularly vivid in recalling those early 
years of the ’60s when the Movement was really active in the streets? 
JG:  Well, part of the traveling was, of course, going on railroads or airplanes, and, uh, 
the railroads were segregated at the beginning.  Airplanes weren’t, but a good many airport 
terminals were, even in North Carolina, even though they were federal facilities.  Uh, so that was 
something noteworthy. 
And we brought a number of cases, a fair number of cases, to desegregate airports.  And I 
recall bringing a case to desegregate the airport in Atlanta, and the plaintiff curiously had the 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 9 of 22 
 
name of Coke, so it was Coke v. City of Atlanta, which is the home of Coca-Cola.  And, uh, I 
brought a case against the airport in New Orleans.  My co-counsel was, uh, A.P. Tureaud, who 
for a period of time was the only black lawyer in New Orleans.  Tureaud, um, I think it was his 
granddaughter; I think he was too old for that to have been his daughter – brought his 
granddaughter to the airport after we won the case.  And she ran off just gleefully.  She was able 
to buy an ice cream cone there, something she had never been able to do before, you know. 
JM:  Yeah.  You mentioned Attorney Tureaud, um, which reminds me of, um, of the 
network of cooperating attorneys that the LDF developed over the years and pioneering black 
attorneys in the South who would very courageously take cases in conjunction with the Legal 
Defense Fund. 
JG:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  Um, but I also want to ask, in ’63, on your own initiative as director-counsel, you 
launched a new training program that would become quite a significant mechanism for extending 
the numbers of black attorneys in the South. 
JG:  Oh, yeah.  Right. 
JM:  And I wonder if you could talk about that a little bit. 
JG:  Well, I, uh – there were a lot of cities where there was no black lawyer at all, or 
maybe one.  But in an amazing number there was none at all.  And I got some money from a 
foundation that, if a black lawyer would agree to set up practice in a place where there were no 
black lawyers, we’d give him ten thousand dollars to buy a typewriter and a rug and some law 
books.  And we got some great stars out of that:  Julius Chambers in North Carolina, and then, 
uh, one of his law partners later on, who is now the congressman from Charlotte. 
JM:  Mel Watt? 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 10 of 22 
 
JG:  Mel Watt.  And then, there’s another congressman, um, who’s in Georgia – and what 
in the world is his name?  I’ll think of it in a moment.  Who, uh – he didn’t want to, uh – he 
wanted to set up practice in Atlanta, but by then there were a handful of black lawyers in Atlanta, 
and I urged him to go someplace – he went to Columbus.  He was the only black lawyer, and 
he’s now the congressman from, from, uh – 
JM:  And Marian – 
JG:  From Columbus. 
JM:  Yeah, excuse me.  Marian Wright also was, I think, in that first class. 
JG:  Marian Wright, yes.  Marian Wright was one of them, yes.  She’s terrific. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, in the, in the run-up towards the Civil Rights Act of ’64, 
particularly, say, by ’63 when Kennedy has introduced legislation, some bill appears [20:00] 
increasingly likely to clear the Congress.  It’s always, you know, not perfectly certain, but there’s 
momentum in that direction, particularly after Kennedy’s assassination obviously.  And the 
Legal Defense Fund, under your direction, is really working hard to craft a litigation program 
that will encompass all of this new legal terrain. 
JG:  That’s right. 
JM:  And I’d love to have you describe how you were thinking about new opportunities 
and what you – the scope of what you hoped maybe to be able to do. 
JG:  Well, one of the things it covered were public accommodations: restaurants and bars, 
theaters, and so forth.  That was pretty easy, because, uh, the, uh, ice cream parlors and the 
restaurants were happy to get the business.  People would say that the market will take care of it, 
but the market did not take care of it.  Nobody wanted to stick his neck out first.  But they, uh – 
so, we did not have a lot of really, no real resistance. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 11 of 22 
 
There were some [efforts at subterfuges].  A lot of hotels set up, um, private clubs within 
the hotel.  And I would recall going to a town and, being white, checking into the hotel and being 
handed a membership card in the club.  It just sort of came with being white and registering in a 
hotel.  If it was a black person that registered, it wouldn’t happen and that would be pretty 
transparent, so -- though it took a little bit of while to figure out that’s what was going on.  Um, 
public accommodations, which was Title II [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] was easy. 
Title VII was employment, and that, of course, we were opposed not only to employers 
who may not have wanted to employ blacks.  Well, many of them didn’t care, would be just as 
happy to employ blacks as to employ whites.  But, uh, we had to confront the fact that the labor 
unions, which on the national level were very pro-civil rights, on the local level were segregated, 
and there were white locals and black locals.  And, uh, white locals didn’t want blacks in, and the 
black locals often didn’t want to lose their members to the white locals.  So, that was a problem.  
Uh, and, uh, we had some of our bitterest cases against the labor unions. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JB:  Joe, let’s pause. 
JM:  Let’s take a little break here. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JM:  Are you feeling comfortable enough with the lights and heat and all? 
JG:  I’m fine.  Okay. 
JM:  Yeah? 
JB:  We’re back. 
JM:  We’re back after a short break.  Um, I’ll come back to, uh, to ask another question 
or two about, uh, Title VII and employment, uh, later in the interview, but, uh, obviously, um, 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 12 of 22 
 
you were attempting in those years, too, to find some way forward with schools.  And Title VI 
helped maybe a little bit on that front, but the schools question would remain very difficult for, 
through the late ’60s. 
JG:  That’s right.  Um, a lot of, um, white parents did not want their kids to go to school 
with black kids.  And, uh, it didn’t take a lot to stir up enough opposition.  So, uh, when we got 
an order to desegregate the schools, there’d be resistance, and it’d be litigated very vigorously.  
And it not only involved schools, but the real estate values that depended upon the schools in the 
neighborhood, so it involved the value of the property people owned.  And these cases were 
vigorously litigated and became the subject of big political fights. 
Nixon had what he called the “Southern Strategy.”  He was going to be opposed to 
integration.  But he was – he had no ideological convictions about this.  He just as soon be 
segregated or nonsegregated.  He wanted to do what would work for him.  Uh, and, uh, after we 
took a case to the Supreme Court, essentially defeating him and the Congress – won the case, 
and he didn’t get in the way, and we had very widespread desegregation, a case called Alexander 
[v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969]. [25:00] 
I really enjoyed taking that case.  It’s a great example of how the laws, all the legal 
documents are interconnected.  We, uh – the way the case came up was we had won some cases 
which indicated that the next round of cases might lead to a Supreme Court decision that schools 
– or even a Court of Appeals decision that schools had to be desegregated immediately.  And, uh, 
when Nixon, or rather, Senator [John] Stennis of, uh, Mississippi – after whom a recent aircraft 
carrier has been named [laughs] – Stennis, uh, saw this was going to happen, he, um, refused to 
bring the Armed Services Appropriation Bill to the floor of the Senate.  I think he told the 
President that, um, his people in Mississippi needed him down there to commune with them. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 13 of 22 
 
And so, Nixon had to, um, ask his Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to ask the 
Court of Appeals to send the cases back to the District Court without deciding them, and, um, in 
the District Court, um, then reconsider whether or not they should order immediate 
desegregation.  And that’s what happened. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JG:  Um, his Secretary – I think [Robert] Finch was his name – [JM sneezes] um, asked 
the, um, Court of Appeals through the Justice Department to, um, not decide the cases.  Well, at 
that point, your option to go to the Supreme Court is very limited, because the law is that the 
Supreme Court will hear cases from a final judgment, and the thing that Nixon was asking for 
was that there be no final judgment.  So, we had to appeal from the absence of a final judgment 
instead of from a final judgment. 
Well, there is an ancient common law writ called certiorari.  It’s not the, uh, writ of 
certiorari that’s in the statutes which the Supreme Court uses to review almost every case it gets.  
But there’s another statute, which says that all the writs known in common law are available in 
the federal courts.  And the ancient writ of certiorari – not the statutory certiorari, but called the 
common law certiorari – says you can bring any case to any court you want.  You know, it 
doesn’t happen very often, doesn’t happen successfully. 
So, I still recall with sort of, in what I’d call mock bravado, telling the staff: “‘My left 
flank is in disarray, my right flank is under attack, my center collapses,’ and as Marshall Foch 
said at the Second Battle of the Marne, ‘I attack.’”  [Laughter] And we did, and the Court agreed 
to hear it and ruled with us. 
JM:  Yeah.  The, uh, the – a further high-water mark on schools, of course, would be 
Swann [v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education], the Swann Charlotte schools case in 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 14 of 22 
 
1971.  And I wonder if you can share your recollections on the Swann case and its significance, 
particularly on busing. 
JG:  Well, Swann was the first substantive case the court heard on how you desegregate, 
and Chief Justice [Warren] Burger wrote, uh, a very avant garde opinion in which he called for 
quotas, uh, and busing, uh, and, uh, integration of teachers, uh, and everything that any civil 
rights advocate ever asked for.  Um, that was his first opinion after Nixon had appointed him. 
Um, so Swann – but as the case began in the Supreme Court, uh, it was not at all certain 
we would win the case, because following the argument, the preliminary vote among the 
lawyers, among the judges was that they would, uh, uphold the lower court, they would not, uh, 
enter the order we finally saw.  But as the, um, conferences among the judges went on, Burger, 
who was the leader of a minimum decision, found himself, um, outvoted by the other justices.  
And Earl Warren [30:00] told me, and I still recall the phrase, he said, “There he stood naked.”  
And, um, he, um, he had – [phone rings] let me turn this thing off. 
JM:  Let’s take a brief break.  Yeah, we’ll come back. 
JB:  Sorry, Joe. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re rolling. 
JM:  We’re back after a short break.  You were just saying that, that, uh, Chief Justice 
Warren had remarked to you that Chief Justice Burger “stood naked.” 
JG:  He had no votes.  Well, the, um – so he would be a dissent, and, well, if he’s in the 
dissent, he can’t assign the opinion.  And he wanted to control the opinion, so he switched his 
vote and decided to vote as the court went so he could assign the opinion to himself, which is 
what he did, uh, and he assigned it to himself.  But he wrote something in the last paragraph of 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 15 of 22 
 
the opinion that said one of these days this is going to have to come to an end, and they’re going 
to reconsider it and not going to require anybody to do anything, something of that sort.  He 
couldn’t really predict how it was going to come out.  But after about ten, fifteen years, that’s 
what happened, relying on that last paragraph of Swann. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  I want to ask, um, thinking about schools – I know the LDF, I think, 
was only in one of these two cases, but I’m interested in your thoughts about – thinking about 
how, you know, how the schools question arced forward from Swann, as you say, it kind of 
maybe reached a high water around 1980 or so, and then the numbers shifted back and the courts 
shifted back on the question.  Um, but I’m thinking about Milliken [v. Bradley] in ’74 and 
Rodriguez [v. City of San Antonio] in ’75, the first being the metropolitan consolidation question, 
obviously, and the second one out of San Antonio being the funding question. 
JG:  Right. 
JM:  And I’m interested in your thoughts on those cases and how you gauge their 
significance. 
JG:  Well, Milliken was significant in that it made the, um, the distinguishing point 
between city and suburbs just the political boundary between them, because, obviously, if you 
have two families living, each like fifty yards on either side of the boundary line, the distance is 
not very great.  Um, two different political systems, one from one county and one from another, 
but, uh, you can work that out.  Um, so, obviously, the court was making the boundary – the city 
and the suburbs having separate, different kind of school systems.  Um, and that was, that was a 
very political decision.  [Sound of door opening] 
JM:  Excuse me one sec.  [Sound of door closing] We had to break there for a moment.  
You were talking about Milliken. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 16 of 22 
 
JG:  So, the decision to make the city-suburban boundary the, the, um, defining factor in 
whether to integrate was political.  I’m not saying that’s a pejorative term.  Uh, you had to use 
some sort of principal.  But, essentially, it had political consequences of which they could not be 
unaware.  Uh, and, uh, that then essentially insulated the suburbs from the integration of the city, 
because you had blacks crowding city, city housing, and not moving to the suburbs, because 
housing was difficult to find and also out of their economic reach.  So, essentially, it continued 
segregation by some other means. 
JM:  Yeah.  It kind of confirmed white flight in that sense. 
JG:  Yes. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  What’s your, what’s your view of, um, the Rodriguez case? 
JG:  Well, the Rodriguez case was similar, essentially, in isolating the economics behind 
the school. 
JM:  Yeah, um, both five-four, both with [U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry] Blackmun 
in the majority, interestingly enough. 
JG:  That’s right. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, let me take you back to, uh, the Title VII and employment arena, 
um, and take you back to [clears throat], not to ’64, in fact, but to ’65, because, of course, there 
was that one-year lag in the effective date of Title VII, and just have you reflect about the LDF 
effort to build out that law, both on the procedural and then later on the substantive side, because 
the landscape was so new and for a lot of times, I mean, for a good while there, there was a lot of 
confusion inside the EEOC.  [35:00] 
JG:  Well, there wasn’t confusion.  There was this, um, lack of will to act.  And, um, I 
suspect that when Lyndon Johnson signed the thing and then appointed FDR Jr. [Franklin D. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11

Roosevelt Jr.], one of Roosevelt’s sons, to run it, he essentially expected nothing much to 
happen.  And that’s what didn’t happen. 
Um, but, um, he didn’t take into account the right to bring private suits, which is what we 
did.  And, um, we set up – it shows something about the futility of careful planning – we set up, 
uh, an economic and manpower study to decide where to bring our cases.  We’d bring the cases 
where there were a lot of blacks who were not fully employed, who were capable of, um, doing 
to work required in the area, um, and a lot of industries that needed manpower and were not 
employing blacks. 
And so, we did studies to find out where these areas were, which I think was a pretty 
intelligent way of going about it.  Of course, we had no way of knowing that the steel industry 
would collapse and it would all move to Japan and Europe, no way of knowing that, um, um, 
tobacco, which was one of the big things, was going to come under fire.  And so, Pittsburgh was 
one of our big targets, but Pittsburgh went out of the steel business. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JG:  Shipbuilding, too. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JG:  Korea and Japan were building ships. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, so that whole, that whole massive de-industrial shift in the 
American economy did undercut the effort to – 
JG:  Yeah, but we still brought a lot of successful cases. 
JM:  Yeah, absolutely, and on the back-pay question in particular. 
JG:  Oh, yeah. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 18 of 22 
 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, let me ask you about Griggs [v. Duke Power] in ’71, the Griggs case 
and disparate impact, and just have you reflect on that case. 
JG:  Well, I argued the Griggs case, and it was, um, it was a pleasure to argue because, 
um, I’d say on the face of it, the outcome is not – is counterintuitive.  A business is going to hire 
somebody who can’t do the job, well, then you have to stop to figure what is the background in 
which this all happened.  So, Griggs worked very well.  And recently, Griggs has been adopted 
by the European Court of Human Rights in cases involving Roma, or Gypsies, which I’m doing 
some work on now that, um [phone rings].  The, um, European Court of Human Rights had a 
case against the Czech Republic, called D.H. v. Czech Republic, um, citing Griggs, how that, um, 
if you give tests which determine what school people go to, and all the Roma, or Gypsies, end up 
in the same school, segregated, that’s an unacceptable result. 
JM:  That’s fascinating.  Yeah, that’s a wonderful example of one of the long, um, sort of 
legacy impacts of that litigation from the ’60s and ’70s.  Um, let me ask, too, about, um – you 
really tried to grapple, um, in your tenure as director-counsel, you really tried to grapple from the 
’60s forward with the, with the poverty, all the implications of poverty, and you set up the NORI 
[National Office for the Rights of the Indigents] office. 
JG:  Right. 
JM:  And I’d love to have you describe that and your vision and hopes on that front. 
JG:  Well, there are a lot of, um, issues that affect people just because they’re poor.  But 
since a disproportionate number of blacks are poor, it affects them.  One case we had, and again 
that I argued, had to do with the, um [phone rings] – I’m going to turn this thing off for good – 
had to do with the, um, garnishment of wages.  If you buy something on time and don’t make 
your payments, then the, um, seller can get your wages paid to him or her rather than to you.  
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 19 of 22 
 
And so, the court handed down a series of cases which are now very big in the civil procedures 
area, um, [40:00] providing that there be a full and fair hearing on the garnishing of wages or 
seizing property. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, another of the things you did quite early, really, was to – 
[Recording stops abruptly and then resumes] 
JB:  It’s back again. 
JM:  Okay, so we’re back, John? 
JB:  Yeah. 
JM:  Okay, we’re back after a short break. 
JG:  Okay.  Well, I’m pleased to say that, um, um, I was the founder of MALDEF 
[Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  And the reason is that we were 
in a number of cases asked by some Mexican-American lawyers in the Southwest to help them 
out or take over some cases.  And they were – at that time I had a survey made.  There was no 
Mexican-American lawyer who had a full set of the Federal Reporter in his office.  So, without 
that, you really couldn’t handle a case in federal court. 
Um, I said, “You guys ought to have an organization of your own.”  Said, “How do we 
do that?”  And I recall we were sitting in an Argentine restaurant on Broadway and around 54th 
Street, um, and, um, we were looking for a Mexican restaurant and we couldn’t find one at the 
time.  [Laughter] You know, that was the closest we could come.  [Laughter] And I called a 
friend at a foundation and got some money from him. 
And we went out and we hired somebody, uh, hired a lawyer called, uh, Mike 
Finkelstein, who now teaches part-time at Columbia Law School, to do a survey of the, uh, 
Mexican-American lawyers, and what their facilities were, and what their capacity was.  We then 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11 
Page 20 of 22 
 
took that to the Ford Foundation and some others and said, “There’s a need for this thing.”  And 
we got a few million bucks to set up MALDEF. 
JM:  Um, there’s so much landscape here of all the work that LDF has done during your 
tenure.  I, I, I want to at least acknowledge, um, LDF did the early work to desegregate hospitals 
across the South. 
JG:  Oh, yeah.  The first big case was against Moses Cone Hospital in, uh – I think it’s in 
Charlotte [Greensboro, North Carolina]. 
JM:  Yeah.  And, uh, so much work on criminal procedure, death penalty, um, prison 
reform. 
JG:  We had the first big prison reform case, uh, and desegregated pretty thoroughly a 
number of – and also just upgraded a number of prison systems throughout the South, yeah. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I just – we don’t really have time to delve into all of these, but the 
history is so rich and so wide that I do at least want to acknowledge that work in, in, in brief.  
Um, Professor Greenberg, let me, let me ask you to – this is, again, a question that, you know, 
you’ve fielded many a time – but looking back, how do you, how do you add up the impacts of 
this work?  I know that you moved on to Columbia Law in ’84, and Julius Chambers took the 
director-counsel position. 
JG:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  But looking back on your long tenure at the LDF, from ’49 to ’84, you were right in 
the thick of all of this history, and I wonder how you gauge and evaluate its impact. 
JG:  Well, it had a big positive impact.  You can always measure it against what, when 
some people write books saying, “It all would have happened without Brown,” and so forth.  
Maybe it would have and maybe it wouldn’t have, but it did.

[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JM:  A few more minutes to wrap up.  Whenever you’re ready, John.  Okay, we’re back 
on.  The question, Professor Greenberg, was –  
JG:  Okay. 
JM: Impact and legacy.  [Pause] We’re back on after a short break. I’m sorry for the 
interruption, yeah.  But just your reflections on impact and legacy of all that work. 
JG:  You can’t quantify it.  I think it had an impact.  Um, there are the usual detractors 
who say it never would have happened, or it would have happened anyway, or it didn’t amount 
to anything.  It just depends on how you want to evaluate it.  I think most people who’ve lived 
through it – some guy wrote a book called The Hollow Hope and said [45:00] the cases didn’t 
amount to anything – if you tell that to anybody that lived through it, they say that’s just total 
nonsense. 
JM:  Right.  That was the book – I remember that book sort of taking up the question of, 
the broad question of the pursuit of social change through litigation, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
What’s, um – what are some of your – just to finish up, what are, um, what are some of your 
assessments of, of the impact of – I think of Nixon and Reagan, um – I think of Reagan going to 
Philadelphia, Mississippi, for example, to kick off his campaign in 1980. 
JG:  Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
JM:  Um, I guess I’m asking the question about the relation of the state to the question of 
race in our culture.  Are there perspectives on that front that you would have to share? 
JG:  Yeah, I think that Reagan had to know – [laughing] or maybe he didn’t know 
anything, but the people around him had to know – that he was essentially, um, trading on anti-
black hostility.  And, um, it’s hard to understand why there are people like that, but there are. 
Jack Greenberg Interview, 7-18-11

JM:  Any final thoughts or observations? 
JG:  No, I guess something I’ve come to the conclusion about, which I hadn’t thought 
earlier: In the last analysis, you can’t escape the politics.  You can do something about them.  
You can do something notwithstanding the politics, but you’re going to have to deal with them.  
And all the progress we made, nevertheless, has to deal with the political implications of it. 
JM:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It’s really an honor and a privilege to be with you, Professor 
Greenberg.  Thank you so much. 
JG:  Thank you. 
JM:  Thank you.
