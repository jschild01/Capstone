AG:  Hi, Mary Ann.  Thank you so much for joining these Library of Congress oral histories.  To 
begin, could I ask you to introduce yourself? 
MN:  Well, I am pleased to be here and thank you for interviewing me.  I'm Mary Ann Nihart.  
I'm currently the Associate Director for Patient Care Services, Nurse Executive at the Veterans 
Administration (VA) in San Francisco.  And I don't know.  What do you want to know? 
AG:  That's terrific.  Can I start by asking you some questions about your family and educational 
background? 
MN:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.   
AG:  So, where were you from?  Where did you grow up? 
MN:  Okay, well, I'm a long ways from there, because I'm in California now.  But I grew up on a 
farm in Iowa.  I'm a farm girl.  Yes.  And you know, I grew up in the days when it was a family 
farm, so everybody worked, everybody did everything.  My mother would have, you know -- it's 
kind of like in those days they called them the threshers, that everybody got together and worked 
each other's farms.  So, they would -- like, in harvest time there would be a lot of people that 
would gather and help -- like, all the men would come and then the women would cook the 
meals.  So, we had -- we were kind of used to a very big community presence, even though rural 
Iowa, I mean, we were outside so Brighton, Iowa.  It was a town about 725 at that time.  And so 
it wasn't a very big place.  But my family was always engaged in taking care of people.  My 
father would say you know -- they called me Annie, so I probably -- but he would say Annie, 
you know, you've never met a stranger.  There aren't -- these people aren't strangers, they're just 
people you don't know yet.  And he said that's the key, is you've got to get to know people.  And 
that phrase has really stayed with me through my whole life.  Which is why it makes it so easy 
for me to sort of engage with people at whatever level, because you want to get to know them.  
You want to learn about them.  These are people who have lives that are, you know, set just like 
mine in events and traumas and drama and stuff and things are going on, and everybody that 
comes to you has a story and they see life through their story.  So, that's what my dad taught me 
is learning about everybody's story. 
AG:  Wow, it sounded like he really imparted empathy and kind of thinking of others outside of 
yourself.  That's incredible. 
MN:  He was a John Wayne kind of guy.  You know?  Bigger than life.  I loved him dearly.  I 
miss him every day.  But he -- wow, he really engaged people.  He loved to talk to folks.  You 
know, being a farmer is not the easiest job in the world and doesn't always pay the bills, so he 
always had other things.  He was one of those.  He had an insurance -- he sold insurance and 
farm insurance, and he had seed corn.  He would sell seed corn on the side.  And we had horses 
that we raised.  We bred Quarter Horses, so he would -- you know, and he was always kind of 
one of those guys that would be doing a deal, you know.  He'd buy three horses, sell one of them 
for what he paid for all three, and then make the profit.  So, frankly, that's how he put both 
myself and my sister through college, and he was very much the guy who made sure that his

5 
family was taken care of.  So -- plus the community.  He was very much engaged in the 
community.  Yeah. 
AG:  Did your mother work in addition to the home and the farm?  Did she have other jobs as 
well? 
MN:  She was a teacher.  She also is the person that probably instilled education from the 
beginning in me.  She had her bachelor's degree from -- she'd gone to Iowa State for a little 
while, but I think she was in those days a little homesick.  So she came back and went to a 
college that was close.  Iowa Westland College was close to where we grew up.  And that's 
actually where she met my dad.  He didn't go to college, but he made sure both of his sisters 
went to college.  So, it was -- it's something that was -- like, reading and being engaged in 
learning -- I mean, they promoted that from -- yeah.  From the time I was very little.  For both 
my sister and I.  I mean, I never even thought about not going to college.   
[5:20]  AG:  And what do you remember of those early years in school?  Your kind of formative 
years? 
MN:  Well, I was a little bit of a geek.  No, I wasn't a little bit of a geek.  I was a lot of geek.  I 
was valedictorian.  I never had anything but an A from the time I was in first grade.  It was 
funny.  I had an English teacher in high school.  I almost got a B from him.  I think he felt guilty.  
But yeah, I didn't do a lot of social things.  Although I did a lot of extracurricular things.  My 
parents wanted us to be well rounded kids, so they gave us piano lessons, sent us to music.  I 
played saxophone in high school band.  I was one of the editors in the year book.  An index 
editor.  And you know, I just -- I was pretty engaged in activities.  But I didn't do the social stuff.  
I didn't -- you know, I was kind of geeky.  I didn't date.  I admit it.  I didn't go to high school 
prom.  You know?  Those sad things in your life that you just didn't get to do?  I look at that stuff 
and I go eh, it didn't kill me. 
AG:  You know, it sounds like you were busy enough otherwise.  Valedictorian, and the band. 
MN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and our band got to go to the International Jazz Festival in Montrose, 
Switzerland when I was a senior.  It was right after my senior year, so that was pretty cool.  So, 
yeah.   
AG:  Do you remember if you had a favorite academic subject while you were in school? 
MN:  Oh.  This is funny.  I mean, I was science all the way.  I took college prep, so I had a lot of, 
you know, biology and physics and chemistry.  And I had some great teachers.  In fact, because I 
was college prep, my freshman year of college were the same books, so it was like -- you know, 
now they give you advanced placement credits, but they didn't do that then.  So, it allowed me to 
get in more trouble my freshman year and still get good grades.  On the other hand, I was in love 
with -- not the teacher.  I don't mean that in a romantic way, but I was in love with Mr. Woodruff 
[ph] and what he could teach me in literature.  He was fantastic.  He made me -- he helped me 
love Shakespeare, and you know, English poets and world literature, and he just opened up that 
whole world, and I took every subject he taught.  I named one of my dogs after him.  He was a 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
6 
great, great teacher.  Unfortunately, he died way too young.  But he was very -- one of those 
engaging people.  I had a lot of, fortunately, very good teachers and mentors.   
AG:  Oh, that's -- yeah.  That is really nice.  Actually, one of the questions I usually ask towards 
the end is do you, like, sort of think about people in your life as academic or professional 
mentors, and it sounds like --  
MN:  Oh, yeah.   
AG:  -- Mr. Woodruff has sort of filled that bill?  
[9:07] MN:  He's one.  But Dr. Kitty Buckwalter [ph] was my mentor in nursing, very much.  So, 
she was at the University of -- she still is at the University of Iowa, and she just was inducted as 
a -- she's a member of -- she's a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing, but they just made 
her a living legend.  So, she's absolutely spectacular, and a true mentor. 
AG:  Was she someone who you studied with as undergraduate or for your graduate? 
MN:  She was in graduate education.  I actually met her when I was a supervisor at the 
University of Iowa in Psychiatry.  I had been out of school and she was getting her doctorate, and 
she would come and work nights on the unit because she was trying -- you know, working some 
as she could.  So, she was around and we knew each other, but we didn't know each other like we 
-- well, she was -- she became my master's thesis advisor and was just much more than that.  So, 
she really encouraged me in academics, and to continue to pursue that, which is why I've always 
had a huge component of teaching in my career. 
AG:  Absolutely.  And you -- I wondered, when did you decide that you wanted to become a 
nurse?  Was it as early as high school?   
[10:47]  MN:  Mmm-mmm.  No.  I know you hear those things from people.  I always wanted to 
be a nurse.  Never occurred to me.  It never occurred to me.  This story is -- I was thinking of -- I 
knew you were going to ask this question and I was like oh my gosh.  Do I really want to share 
this?  But yeah, it's the truth.  I think when I share it with younger people, I try to share it in a 
way that says you know, you don't always know exactly what you're going to be doing when you 
go to college.  You just don't.  But that's the point of college.  It's sort of finding that niche, 
finding that place.  So, I always thought I wanted to be a doctor.  Okay?  And I wanted to go to 
the University of Iowa because I grew up in Iowa, it was up the road, but you know, in the '70s, 
and '60s, the University campuses were kind of frightening places for parents.  You know, there 
were demonstrations.  I found it exciting.  I would slip away and go up to Iowa City if I could.  I 
didn't like, you know, getting caught, but Iowa City was only 14 miles from us, and so it was -- 
I'd go with friends, and you know, there were demonstrations.  Demonstrations against the war.  
The Vietnam War.  And there was just a lot going on, and I really wanted to be a part of that.  I 
wanted to be, you know -- it was also a lot of -- the encounter groups, the discussions, talking 
about women and women's rights and women's roles and that they can be more than housewives 
or teachers -- I mean, nursing didn't even enter the discussion for me.  So, I got to go to the 
University of Iowa despite my parents largely because I got one of the pharmacists in town -- 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
7 
 
Mr. Schoonover [ph] -- to kind of support me because there were two pharmacy schools in -- this 
is going to sound so devious when I tell you this.  But there were two pharmacy schools in Iowa.  
One was the University of Iowa and one was Drake University, which was a private university, 
which I knew my parents couldn't afford.  So, it was -- even though I had good grades and 
scholarships and all that stuff, I knew that Iowa City would be a more likely choice, and then I 
changed my major shortly after getting there because I had no interest in being a pharmacist.  So, 
I did all my premed, I got accepted early decision, so that's after your junior year.  And the 
summer before I was supposed to start, I was just -- I don't know, sick, anxious.  I didn't want to 
really do it.  I mean, I was looking at four years of medical school, four years of, you know, 
residencies and internships and stuff like that, and I just -- I didn't want to do it.  So, I decided 
not to, took a step back, and went okay, now what do I do?  Well, I'm still interested in medicine 
and I'm still interested in people.  I'll apply to nursing. Well, lo and behold, who thought that I 
needed to go back and take things like anthropology to be a nurse?  Because nursing education is 
much broader.  It's not as science-focused, even though science is part of it.  It's much broader.  
You know, in making that decision, I actually added a year to my education.  But I got accepted 
and at that time, Iowa City, the university, it was very hard to get into.  I was the only one of six 
of my friends that got in to my class.  But I loved it.  I absolutely -- from that moment on, I was 
sold.  I had a little different view of nursing than some of my instructors.  Sometimes I was a 
little -- I don't know.  I took seriously what they would teach me, and so I thought I could apply 
it.  And yet when I would do -- when I was at the university, I was fine.  But when I would work 
at a private hospital, I kind of got myself in trouble, because I would do things -- like, I had a 
patient one time that was about to be discharged and she was newly diagnosed with diabetes and 
nobody -- I was going to be sending her home with syringes and, you know, insulin, and nobody 
had taught her how to give herself an injection.  So, I went down to the cafeteria and I got an 
orange and we practiced.  And she felt so comfortable and she told her doctor she was so grateful 
to this nurse that -- he was furious.  He wanted to make sure -- yeah, you know, this was the '70s.  
We were on the edge of -- you know, it was a different time.  It was a very different time.  So, 
my instructor was very much upset with me.  But I've done things kind of like that my whole 
career.  Just sort of, you know -- it was the right thing to do so I did it, and it was for the patient, 
and that's the most important thing.  Yeah.  And that's a long-winded answer, wasn't it? 
 
[16:48] AG:  No, that's wonderful.  Thank you.  And I was going to say that my sense, you 
know, as an outsider, that that kind of patient advocacy and education is now much more integral 
to nursing and --  
 
MN:  Oh, yeah. 
 
AG:  -- medical practice more generally, right?  Yeah.   
 
MN:  Absolutely. 
 
AG:  So, you were ahead of the curve on that one. 
 
MN:  Well, at the time, you know, the physician was the boss, and you didn't do something 
unless the physician said so, but that wasn't how I was learning.  Because I was going to a 
university program who taught you to think and to make sure that things were prepared for your 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
8 
 
patient.  That you didn't have plans that could be, you know, undone by the simplest of things, 
like not teaching somebody or not preparing somebody.  I know later in my own life when I had 
to take Coumadin.  Well, not Coumadin.  It was a low -- I had to give myself the injections.  I 
forget what it's called.  But it's of the -- it's Heparin, but it's a small -- oh, shoot, I can't remember 
the name.  Anyway, I had to give myself injections, and even though I've done a thousand 
injections in other people, it's a completely different thing to give it to yourself.  And the doctor 
just sent me out with it, like, assuming I knew, and that happened not that long ago.  I happened 
to get a blood clot on a long flight from South America.  So, I went to a friend of mine who's a 
nurse and I said to her could you help me with this the first time.  It really wasn't so bad after 
that, but it was kind of weird.  I'm not on it anymore.  Thank god.   
 
AG:  I can just imagine.  Yeah.  Self-administering an injection. 
 
MN:  It's completely different.  You know? 
 
AG:  Very different.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So, it sounds like some of the -- like, with the orange 
and the instruction -- that was while you were still a nursing student.  Is that right?  Do you 
remember your first job as a nurse?   
 
[19:09] MN:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  In those days, you couldn't go directly into psychiatry, and I'm a 
psychiatric mental health nurse by preference, by specialty, and then my master's is really 
focused on psychiatric mental health nursing.  So, I sat for my boards as a clinical nurse 
specialist, and then later took the additional courses to get my NP, my Nurse Practitioner.  So, 
yeah, my focus has been in psychiatric mental health nursing.  But when I first worked, you 
couldn't just go to psychiatry until you've been a real nurse, and I'm doing air quotes for a reason.  
Because I think real nursing is everywhere and all kinds of different roles.  But in those days, 
you needed to be on a med surg unit or in surgery or something like that, or in ICU.  So, I went 
and worked in surgery.  And because everybody knew that I had a preference towards 
psychiatry, I got all of the patients that had cognitive deficits, that had behavior challenges, that 
had -- if there was a particular bent on a patient that was behavioral, I ended up with that person.  
And so, I -- it was kind of challenging for a new graduate.  And then there's the other thing.  
Back in those days, they did silly things like put new graduates -- we didn't do transition to 
practice programs like we do now.  New grad programs.  We put you on nightshift, and you 
know, you worked alone quite often, and here you were -- you had book learning, you had, you 
know, simulations and some clinical practice, but you didn't really have -- you didn't have that 
wealth of experience and knowledge to really figure things out.  And you know, nurses do things 
like save lives.  I mean, they do it directly because you're there by yourself, and how early you 
recognize and how early you get help in, and how you intervene is incredibly important.  And 
people do stuff like die at 4:00 a.m. and you are there trying to figure out how to get all this stuff 
-- you're trying to help people.  You're trying to -- you start a code, you start doing CPR, and -- 
oh, all the things that can possibly go wrong tend to go wrong in the middle of the night. 
 
AG:  So, brand new grad in the surgical unit, overnight shift, getting the patients that had 
cognitive or behavioral issues.  What was that like?  What were some of the -- what were your 
responsibilities in the surgical unit apart from, like --  
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
9 
 
MN:  Oh, everything.  IVs, dressing changes.  And remember I was working at the University of 
Iowa.  I stayed on at the University of Iowa, so we -- you know, being a tertiary care center, you 
get a lot of complex cases.  Individuals who had had complications to their treatment and 
interventions and -- you know, it's -- I remember one gentleman that I took care of.  It would take 
an hour and a half to do his dressing change, because you just had to -- he had this large -- and 
abdominal incisions that had been, you know, infected in the past and had opened up and that's 
how he came to the university, and so he had been debrided and wired such, and so we had had 
to wrap every one of those individually, the wires.  It was really quite extensive, and you know, 
you took care of patients.  We didn't have all these drip monitors then.  We literally had to time 
the IVs and count the drips, and make sure they didn't run in too fast and didn't get adjusted 
incorrectly.  And invariably, sometimes something happened.  The patient whatever -- so, now 
with the machines they have that control the drips and control the -- there's a lot more technical 
involvement, like in ICU.  I ended up going to ICU because I actually loved it.  I went to 
psychiatry for a while and then I went back -- when I went -- took my graduate program, I 
worked in neuro and neuro surgery and neurointensive care.  I loved it.  By the way, neuro and 
psychiatry have a lot in common.  So, anyway, yeah, you did all of those things.  Of course, 
those were the days where you could do specific gravities in urine on the unit.  You know, we 
did -- I mean, I still remember glass IV bottles.  So there's -- I know I'm dating myself.  Anyway.  
A lot has changed in my career. 
 
AG:  It sounds like it.  Yeah, a lot of sort of changes in the actual nursing practice as well as the 
kind of mechanization.  Wow.  So, when did you go back for your later degrees?  Was that 
shortly after?  Was it still in Iowa?  
 
[24:54] MN:  My first degree was. 
 
AG:  It was? 
 
MN:  My first master's.  I was out for about three years.  And then I decided to get my master's 
degree and specialize.  So, I went back and graduated in '81 with my master's in -- specifically, 
they had role develop, so it was a clinical nurse specialist and kind of an education degree.  But it 
focused as a specialty in psychiatry.  So, my master's thesis was on manipulative behavior of all 
things.  Yeah, I was looking at labels that people put on folks.  That's kind of why I'm interested 
in anthropology.  At that point in time, you know, I looked at some of the contributors of how 
individuals are labeled, and once they carry a label, particularly, you know, that individual is 
manipulative, you know, I found things in documentation, in how people rated the patient, how 
people -- how individuals -- I did it in three different settings, but they tended to see things in a 
more negative light.  Like an individual could come up and ask for -- in one case I found aspirin, 
and it was documented as drug-seeking behavior.  So, it was kind of a lightning bolt in my head 
that I've spent a lot of my career combatting things like stigma and how we label people.  How 
we think about patients, and making sure that we advocate for the best for everybody.  And I 
think that's much more common today, but I think like everyone, you have to kind of grow into it 
and recognize it.  I was very involved in restricting the use of restraints.  I've made a career out 
of working with people who have very violent behavior, make threats, become assaultive.  In 
your emergency rooms, in your mental health units, in -- even in care in the community, people 
can become violent because, you know -- bottom line, the most common reasons are fear, 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
10 
 
number one, and utter frustration.  And the healthcare system, by itself, and the public sector 
healthcare, has tons of reasons for fear and tons of reasons for frustration.  And so recognizing 
that and intervening in a way that helps reduce fear often is the best way to deescalate assaultive 
behavior, and I've even worked with police over my career, so -- yeah, so I've been following 
some of our latest episodes very, very closely.  And that, you know, if I could say -- I have to say 
on both sides that it's an utter tragedy when we use a restraint of any type that suffocates or 
restricts breathing on people.  And over the years, we had done a lot of that.  We have done 
prone restraints.  Face down restraints.  So, you're on your stomach, it's not as easy to see people.  
And then, you know, chokeholds and things like that that get used with the police -- folks now 
know that many of those things are a problem.  And it is incorporated in their training.  So, I get 
really, really kind of irritated that we still use them.  But on the other hand, when you're 
confronted with violence -- and I've been on the other end of a gun twice.  The wrong end.  In 
my career when I supervised Mount [Inaudible -- 29:39] crisis, I had a guy come in with a gun.  
And also in the street, when I did outreach in the Tenderloin and South [ph] Market, and in both 
cases, it's very hard to have self-control and keep your head about you.  And people fall back on 
sort of what they learn and decision making is difficult. So, yeah, I have great empathy for all 
sides in these cases, but most importantly there are ways to deescalate without being more 
violent yourself.  Even for the police.  But it takes a lot of training. 
 
[30:28] AG:  Right.  For those kind of automatic reactions to be trained --  
 
MN:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, it's self-control.  And when you're in a fear base yourself, you tend 
to fall back on what you learned as a kid or what you might react to as a person instead of your 
training, which is why you've got to overtrain, and yet training is seen by many as expensive, 
even in healthcare.  It's seen as expensive.  An expensive investment.  But there's nothing -- even 
as an administrative person myself right now, I feel like you can't train staff enough.  You have 
to do more.   
 
AG:  You know, Mary Ann, I'm wondering, it sounds like you worked in a crisis center and you 
also did street outreach.  The street outreach was in San Francisco.  Was the crisis --  
 
MN:  That was my first job coming to California in 1981.  Yes. 
 
AG:  1981 in [inaudible -- 31:27] 
 
MN:  Yes.  It was a different world then.  Moscone Center didn't exist.  There was a real wino 
park in between two buildings that -- oh my gosh, and I was in all those old hotels.  Yeah, but it 
was one of the best jobs that I ever had.  It was awesome.   
 
AG:  What was that role?   
 
MN:  I was a clinical nurse specialist working with geriatrics -- individuals that were older who 
had mental health problems, and that ranged from dementia, early dementia, which isn't really a 
mental health problem.  It's much more of a brain problem in neurology.  But it results in 
cognitive loss and behavioral change, and as a result people living alone become vulnerable.  
And so I would go out to the hotels and assess people and see what they need, and I often 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
11 
 
worked with a social work partner, trying to get people the kind of help that would support them, 
wanting to keep them in the community.  But what most people didn't realize even at the time is 
in those old hotels in the Tenderloin there were a lot of elderly.  We had probably about 15,000 
people living in single hotel rooms in the Tenderloin at that time, and yeah, the streets were quite 
different at night than they were during the day.  You would see elderly with walkers and things 
crossing streets and then in the night it was, you know, street life, street hustle, prostitution, drug 
dealing, all of that was all around the same individuals.  It was a different world.  But yeah, I did 
outreach during the day.  I was young.  I was from Iowa.  Can you imagine?  But I loved it.  It 
was great.   
 
AG:  What kind of services do you provide in that capacity when you're going to -- this was like 
the single room occupancy hotels? 
 
MN:  Mmm-hmm.   
 
AG:  That kind of thing? 
 
MN:  Exactly.  Well, the things that I did were mostly the psychological assessments, the 
components of trying to figure out if we needed a more thorough dementia workup or if there 
was something that we could do psychiatrically.  If there was treatment, medication -- I mean, I 
had one woman who was so paranoid she just wouldn't meet anybody anywhere near where she 
lived, so I would meet her over at the old Woolworth's lunch counter.  And it was great because I 
kept her -- she learned to trust me, and I kept her from doing things that would get her kicked out 
of her housing often by building that relationship and that trust over time, and you know, I didn't 
see a lot of people on a continuous basis.  Mostly it was crisis interventions.  But it was non-
medication oriented, very much focused on safety, very much focused on getting the right 
resources and to help the individuals.  But you know, once the hotel owners get to know you, 
you get drug into all kinds of things.  Like, I had a gentleman -- a young man who had traveled 
to the city.  He had lost his medications, as I figured out later.  I sorted this out.  But he was 
bipolar.  Had bipolar effective disorder, and he had lost his lithium, and he was in a full manic 
episode.  And he had somehow gotten himself down inside the elevator shaft in the hotel.  And 
this owner came running out when she saw me going by and said -- or this manager, and said 
Mary Ann, Mary Ann, can't you come help me?  And so I went in.  And I spent about 30, 40 
minutes talking him out of the elevator shaft.  I know.  And then the police showed up and put 
him in handcuffs and it was sad.  But I had learned this whole history while I was talking to him, 
that -- you know, because I figured out that he was very clearly symptoms of mania and he didn't 
know what he was doing.  That poor guy, he was in such a sad shape.  So he really didn't need 
handcuffs, but at least he got to San Francisco General and got the help he needed.  Yeah. 
 
[36:16] AG:  Were you employed by the city? 
 
MN:  Yes, at that time.  Yeah.  I worked for the city and county of San Francisco. 
 
AG:  Wow, and this was after your first master's but before the second master’s degree? 
 
MN:  Correct.  Correct. 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
12 
 
 
AG:  When did you pursue that second master's?  Was that also in the San Francisco area? 
 
MN:  Well, let's see.  Yes, I went to -- I decided to get -- I wanted to get a PhD in psychology.  I 
was particularly interested in neuropsychology and I started taking classes toward the end of the 
'80s, and then you know, life happens.  My parents were ill, my husband and I split up, I had a 
number of, just, crises, and so I got a second master's and didn't complete the PhD.  So, yeah.   
 
AG:  Did that change your career at that point, or was it sort of just like augmenting the --  
 
MN:  It was augmenting.  I mean, I use today the things that I learned in neuropsychology.  It 
was invaluable.  It really was.  Because I could learn the functions of various areas of the brain 
and how to test those and how to -- you know, sort of locate lesions without using any imagery.  
And you didn't know what was wrong, but you knew that something was wrong in those areas, 
because those were the functions that were disrupted.  So, it was very helpful.  It helps in 
understanding language, understanding how people experience the world.  It sort of breaks down 
the components of thought.  Sort of the hierarchy and how the brain works together, and also 
how fantastic the brain is at working around deficits.  You know?  So, I love studying the brain, 
and studying how it results in behavior.   
 
AG:  And you mentioned earlier your title now is Nurse Practitioner? 
 
MN:  Well, I am technically still certified as a Nurse Practitioner, and as a Clinical Nurse 
Specialist, and I maintain both of those. 
 
AG:  Mmm-hmm.  
 
MN:  So, I practice just a little bit.  This past year -- you know, you get older.  I had a hip 
replacement so I haven't done clinical for about a year, but I just got reinstated so I'm going to 
start again in terms of my privileges.  But I like doing consult liaison work because it's very 
much the same kind of thing as working in the medical side at the hospital, but figuring out 
delirium, dementia, what sorts of things are causing behavioral change for individuals that are 
hospitalized for medical reasons, and we work as a consultive service to the physicians that are 
providing the medical care.  So, it's actually quite good.  It's fun. 
 
AG:  That sounds really interesting. 
 
MN:  It is. 
 
[39:42] AG:  I'm just asking -- forgive me -- clarifying questions.  Could you explain what a 
nurse practitioner -- what that sort of credentialing is like and what that title means different from 
one of the other kind of classifications of nursing that you maintain?   
 
MN:  So, an RN works on an independent basis in the sense that you have a license, and you 
have a scope of practice, but you're still, as the medical team goes, more dependent on the 
physician and the people that are leading the team.  Whereas a nurse practitioner ends up with 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
13 
 
advanced training and usually has an area of specialization and a scope.  You can be a family 
nurse practitioner and be -- for example, your primary care physician, where you're a diagnosis 
and referral source, and you refer to a number of other specialists.  And you help sort out what's 
going on.  But in psychiatry, we can be primary practitioners, so we can prescribe medications, 
we can have the full scope.  And this is the difference between clinical nurse specialist in 
psychiatry and a nurse practitioner -- actually, as a clinical nurse specialist, I had to have 1,500 
hours of therapy experience, and did a lot more work on behavioral interventions.  Particularly in 
my case, I worked on cognitive behavioral interventions, but you know, you have more of a 
specialization in that aspect of psychiatry whereas having the nurse practitioner, you have 
advanced pathophysiology, advanced pharmacology, you have those kinds of components that 
you add to it, so you can also use the psychiatric medications.  But within that scope of practice, 
for example, I wouldn't be treating.  I might notice cardiac symptoms and refer those out but I 
wouldn't be treating cardiac symptoms.  I wouldn't be -- so, you're working at an advanced level 
but you're working within a narrower scope than maybe a physician might.  But you're still a 
licensed independent practitioner.   
 
AG:  That makes sense.  Thank you so much for clarifying. 
 
MN:  Mmm-hmm.  
 
AG:  And the consulting that you do or that you're going to, like, resume shortly -- is that 
through your position with the VA or is this something that you do to maintain your --  
 
MN:  Okay, consult liaison work is within the VA. 
 
AG:  It is. 
 
MN:  And it's a team.  I work with a psychiatrist.  We have some fellows.  There's a group.  But 
we see patients within the hospital, and I just do, like, Monday mornings kind of thing.  Because 
I really have a more than fulltime job as is, so -- but it's so much better to go out -- in the 
consultation role, you're on all the units.  You're with all the different treatment teams, you're in 
the ICU, you're wherever they need you, and even sometimes I had a situation where I went into 
the post-anesthesia unit because of a man becoming very delirious and combative post-
anesthesia.  You know?  And anesthesia causes a lot of changes in behavior, so I worked 
throughout the hospital.  And that gives me a sense of what's going on on the front lines in a 
different way.  Administration can kind of be isolating.  You effect a whole lot more change for a 
whole lot more people, but it's sort of lonely.   
 
AG:  Right.  You don't have that face to face patient interaction. 
 
MN:  Mmm-hmm.  
 
AG:  What is your role -- what is the administrative component?  Like your kind of full time 
role?  What does that entail?   
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
14 
 
MN:  Oh, I'm the Associate Director for Patient Care Services.  As I said in the beginning.  So, 
even though I'm the nurse exec and I have responsibility for nursing throughout the facility, I 
also have social work, I have chaplains, I have veteran experience.  Those are all components -- 
and the advocate's office are all the components that are part of my administrative oversight. 
 
AG:  And what is your typical work schedule like in, you know, kind of the administrative 
function, not the consult liaison? 
 
MN:  I'm wedded to this phone.  What's my work schedule like?  Well, Monday through Friday, 
most of the time, but you know I can get called all weekend, or if there's certain crises that 
happen.  We have supervisors that cover in the house.  We have -- in the medical center.  But 
they'll call us for things that happen outside of what their typical day would be.  So, we may have 
some administrative -- I mean, not every weekend.  Most weekends are not, but sometimes 
evenings and weekends I might get a call when there's a particular crisis that's occurred or they 
have to active an emergency, like bring in on call units for surgery or something like that.  So, 
we might get called.  Or a pipe breaks, or there's a flood in the basement, or -- I don't know.  Any 
number of things that can happen in a hospital. 
 
[45:33] AG:  What are some of the most common issues that you have to field in your role? 
 
MN:  Oh, probably the single biggest one is -- I would say staffing.  I think we've got that pretty 
much handled, but that was probably the biggest challenge when I started because we were at a 
particularly low point when I took this role.  But we have built a pipeline of education with 
residences and transition to practice programs, and things that actually make a huge difference in 
where we're at today in staffing.  So, that's not the biggest thing, although over this past year I 
can tell you I am so proud of the nursing staff throughout this past year, because we did not have 
huge numbers of COVID patients in San Francisco as you probably know if you watch national 
news.  We locked down fairly early.  I mean, there's been a toll.  I don't know what the economic 
toll is going to be yet, but we did have -- we implemented all the restrictions, the masking, the 
social distancing, and in the Bay Area, at least, we did not have the spread, the huge numbers, 
even though we had early cases.  You may recall some of the first cases were in San Jose and -- 
so we could have gotten bad but we didn't.  But in that light, we still had to constantly pivot.  I 
mean, we had prepared for a surge.  I also do a lot of incident command work, so I'm trained in 
disaster, and in hospitals, we have to set up an incident commands and operate in emergencies 
out of that framework, so you've -- I've taken the FEMA training, and -- but we prepared for a 
surge, we cross trained staff, we floated staff, we shut down one of our transitional units for -- 
that is really a step down from ICU to a med surge floor and we turned that into a COVID unit, a 
respiratory care unit.  So we had to train staff differently.  We had to prepare for having lots of 
ventilators, and so we needed to train a lot of people in ICU level care.  So we cross trained 
there.  We had the PACU set up to become an ICU -- our post-anesthesia unit.  We had thought 
several tiers down of where we could expand and take more patients.  It never came to that but it 
was a lot of preparation.  Then we had to do the swab clinics, and do all the COVID testing, and 
you know -- those nasopharyngeal swabs that everybody loves so much.  And so, nurses that -- 
ORs were shut down, so we pulled OR nurses and trained them to be more outpatient nurses, and 
to staff those clinics.  Then we had outreach teams that went into congregate living situations.  
When there would be little outbreaks, we'd go in and -- like, where veterans lived, we would do 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
15 
 
testing on as many people who would allow us to test in those areas to make sure that we 
contained the virus.  We did all of that and then pivoted to vaccines, and we did it all with the 
same staff, and now we're doing mobile teams to go into areas where there are a number of 
veterans that still struggle with homelessness and they struggle with substance.  And often at the 
core of that is post-traumatic stress and the effects of trauma.  It makes people feel -- there are a 
number of our veterans who would literally rather live in isolation and away from people but 
know they don't have any support, they don't have the way to -- so, they live on the margins.  
And we reach those people.  We have programs to get out there and engage them, connect with 
them wherever they're at, and try to reach them.  I think one of the best things about the VA is 
the comprehensive nature of our services.  There's no healthcare system that would do some of 
the things that we do for our individuals.  We have a lot of fires, for example, in California as 
you know.  And the fires really affect our folks.  Before I was the associate director, I became -- 
for Patient Care Services -- I was a clinical director for ambulatory care in our community case-
based outpatient clinic, so I had all of our CBOCs, and for San Francisco, our catchment area, we 
have a clinic in Eureka which is a six hour drive from San Francisco.  We have clinics in Ukiah, 
Clear Lake, Santa Rosa, Lake County, if you follow it, has burned every year for the past I don't 
know how many years, and when we started, we put together teams of volunteers when the 
county was badly burned and there was a lot of evacuees, and we reached out to our veterans.  I 
mean, we had on sight mobile unit, and we would call veterans, make sure they were in their 
homes, or call cellphones and reach out to them in any way and see if we could get them 
services.  If they needed services, if they couldn't get to the clinic or they couldn't get to us, or 
they were on oxygen and they needed extra oxygen, or they needed their CPAP or they were 
evacuated and didn't have their medicines.  We got emergency medicines to them.  So I'm kind 
of used to setting up big sorts of systems that are safety nets.  And that is our fourth mission in 
the VA is to be part of disaster response federally.  So, we've done a number of those things over 
this past year, helping areas.  We have employees that we have sent to the Navajo Nation.  I just 
had two nurse that came back from there.  We've had employees that have been sent throughout 
the country to other VAs to respond when we didn't have the need but other folks had the need.  
And we trained people to do that, and that's something I don't think a lot of systems do.  I'm very 
proud of the work -- I'm very proud to finish my career at the VA.   
 
[53:13] AG:  You know, I'm wondering, given especially how efficient and sort of successful at 
managing the spread the VA in the Bay Area was -- are you taking any lessons forward from the 
COVID-19 -- or perhaps even from the fires, you know, year after year?  Anything that's sort of 
stuck with you? 
 
MN:  Well, we started from scratch, literally seven years ago, it felt like, but now, unfortunately, 
we have so many repeated disasters that I feel like every year we learn something.  So we've 
prepared things like business continuity plans, so that we have mobile computers in each of the 
units, and hot points, so we can set up shop wherever and get lists of people and call them for 
appointments and tell them that they can't get to the clinic or tell -- reach out to them to see if 
they need something.  So we've set up systems.  Probably in the fires, the biggest challenge has 
been smoke, and air quality.  It's been horrible.  So we have extra units in all of our CBOCs to 
purify all the air in the clinic.  So, we've learned how to do those kinds of things.  COVID has 
been a whole other experience.  It has taken a toll on medical staff in -- I can't even describe the 
ways.  Even if you haven't done tons of work -- I mean, I would go up on the COVID units and 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
16 
 
we set up isolation units so we could -- you know, we didn't want to waste any PPE at first.  We 
had PPE shortages.  We now keep a very close watch on our PPE in a different way than we used 
to, and our logistics department has been wonderful and accommodating to that.  We've learned 
how to set up mass vaccination programs.  Mass clinical testing.  We've been one of the major 
testers for a number of different facilities around, so -- because we've actually covered, like, the 
veteran's state home for testing.  But probably the biggest thing that I think we could continue to 
learn from and do better at is our own selfcare.  I'm seeing it in people now even though we 
haven't had the numbers.  The exhaustion.  Staying in an emergency state for this long has been 
utterly exhausting, and like I've said, I've been very proud of our nursing staff and our medical 
staff, everybody.  Our logistics, our engineering, everyone has pivoted and done what is needed, 
but I don't know that we've taken as good of care of ourselves as we should.  I see people are 
getting burnt.  They're tired.  Yeah, I think probably the lesson that we can take away from this is 
learning how to sustain.  Because being in a state of crisis for over a year has been very 
challenging.  And to keep peoples' alertness up.  You know how in the community folks are 
starting to kind of not wear their masks and gather again and -- you know, they think the vaccine 
is an end all, be all, and it's not, and so we have this little surge going on in the Midwest at least, 
and I see the same thing in medical staff with folks wanting to gather.  You know?  We're social.  
We want to gather.  And so I'm just being -- kind of reminding everyone to hang on, keep going.  
This is a marathon, not a sprint, we've got to get to the end.  But the vaccines have been a huge 
turning point.  Vaccine clinic is almost a celebratory kind of thing.  People are excited to give out 
shots and know that they're contributing to the end of this, instead of taking care of folks who are 
so totally disabled by this.  And COVID, you know -- I was in San Francisco the first year for 
Index 1 of HIV.  When we called it GRID, the Gay Related Immune Deficiency.  That was -- and 
the blood scares, and the bath houses that had to close, and all of that, and I'm so reminded -- and 
Dr. Fauci actually was involved.  And that's -- you know, his first claim to fame was HIV.  So, 
he's been at the beginning of public health crises, and I just keep reminding people about COVID 
-- we didn't know everything about HIV in the beginning.  For ages, remember, we were scared 
to death of it, and we thought it was only in the gay community and it wasn't.  It was a 
bloodborne pathogen, and so we had to learn about it.  And it's a virus.  Viruses are different.  
They mutate, and now you're seeing that happen.  I mean, there's many, many variants of HIV.  
And we have gotten so many incredible treatments that we have -- I mean, we've done amazing 
things.  You don't even think about HIV anymore.  And now you can take PrEP.  And not even 
worry about it.  Even sexually.  So, I think with COVID, at some point, we will get into a similar 
place, but I think the public -- the hardest thing about this crisis for the year has been the 
politicization of a healthcare crisis.  And that by itself took a toll on staff.  To be working so hard 
to save people, you know -- to have to say to a family member like in the beginning we only 
have PPE for one family member to go in to say goodbye.  I know it's your father, I know you're 
all in family, but we can't, so we can get you an iPad or -- and we were special because we were 
doing that.  Lots of people died alone.  So, it's hard to see the public think what we're doing isn't 
real.  I don't even know how absolutely sad that is.   
 
[60:51] AG:  Just like you said, such a toll psychologically on the medical staff, the nursing staff, 
in addition to the patients. 
 
MN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's something that I -- sorry, I'm a sap.  But that's something that I hope I 
never see again. 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
17 
 
 
AG:  Right.  Yeah.  Such a good point.  Absolutely.  Mary, are there things that you've learned 
over your career that help in terms of selfcare?  I mean, this is probably a kind of extreme 
example, but working with HIV patients, working with homeless elderly population, and then the 
California fires -- what have you done to care for yourself in these high pressure situations? 
 
MN:  Oh, I've had lots of downtime, too, you know?  The middle of my career was all about 
teaching, and you know, I have been involved in education.  I'm also an associate clinical 
professor at the University of California, San Francisco, so --  
 
AG:  I think that's how we got connected, through one of [inaudible -- 62:00] 
 
MN:  That's right.  So, I've been teaching and speaking -- I was President of the American 
Psychiatric Nurses Association, I was Psychiatric Nurse of the Year.  You know, there's the 
awards and stuff, but the most important thing is that I've been engaged with people across the 
country and have a tremendous support system, just friends that are colleagues and I have quite -
- even though I chose never to get married again, I have a large family here.  And then I'm very 
involved.  I'm like my father.  I'm very involved in the community.  So, I do a lot of community 
activities, and I ended up being on City Council.  I'm actually -- I was actually a two time Mayor 
of Pacifica, and I did a lot with city government and county government.  I was Chair of the City 
and County Association of Governments for two and a half years.  And I love problem solving.  I 
love governing.  I don't like running for office.  There's nothing about that process that is fun.  I 
mean, I love meeting people and I love hearing from people, but politics has become, 
unfortunately, a sport of kind of meanness.  And the sad thing about it is -- particularly with 
social media, anybody can say anything about anyone, put it up on the internet -- in no amount of 
time at all it becomes truth and it wasn't even remotely true, but it doesn't matter.  Because going 
back on it, it's hard.  You know?  I had my own situation happen and it was good, because it 
allowed me to take my promotion and become the Associate Director, because if you have 
federal employment, you can't be involved in partisan politics.  And I don't want to be involved 
in partisan politics, so I -- you know, the races at the council level, at the school board level, 
even at the Board of Supervisors, are supposed to not be partisan.  And they're nonpartisan by 
law in California.  But there was somewhere in the mid-90s that there were -- I guess a court case 
or something where political party endorsement was actually considered a part of speech, and so 
parties could endorse candidates even in those races.  Well, that's the first step on a slippery 
slope when it happens, and while I didn't take an endorsement, someone else in the last race I 
was in did and somebody figured out the Hatch Act and then they kept making it an issue to raise 
the bar on what would cross the line into making it partisan, and for the Office of Special 
Council, related to the Hatch Act, that's when money gets into the race.  And so some of that 
happened and I ended up finally saying after eight years I'm withdrawing.  This isn't worth my 
job.  This is -- you get about $350 for being on council, which means it doesn't even pay the car 
and meal and various things that you do.  Yeah, it doesn't pay expenses, so it really wasn't worth 
it even though I loved governing.  I loved getting in and figuring out, you know -- at the local 
level, I think it has a lot to do with nursing.  Remember I said in the beginning listening to 
people?  And everybody has a story?  I feel like council members have to recognize that when 
they're elected they represent the whole community, even if the whole community doesn't share 
their political views.  You represent everybody.  So it truly is nonpartisan, and you have to do 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans  
 
18 
 
what you think is the very best thing for your community.  And often you have to listen to 
peoples' viewpoints and figure it out, and it's a lot like what I did in psychiatry.  Because even 
that person who comes screaming at you at the council and is very upset -- they've got a point of 
view, so you need to try to figure out what that is. 
 
[66:57] AG:  Right.  It's sort of just like a translation of your nursing and your community based 
--  
 
MN:  Absolutely. 
 
AG:  -- orientation.  Absolutely.  Well, we are about at an hour and 10 minutes.  Do you have 
another minute --  
 
[CROSSTALK] 
 
MN:  I have another few minutes.  
 
AG:  Okay, good. 
 
MN:  You're going to have to edit this down. 
 
AG:  Not at all.  This has been wonderful.  I just want to make sure I'm not keeping you too long, 
because I could ask you a million more questions. 
 
MN:  No.  This is fun. 
 
AG:  It's really enjoyable.  I'm so enjoying myself.  I wondered if in, like, the last 10, 15 minutes, 
if I could ask some questions sort of retrospectively, thinking about your career, that kind of 
thing. 
 
MN:  Mmm-hmm.  Sure. 
 
AG:  So, for example, how long have you worked for the VA? 
 
MN:  So, let's see.  I came to the VA "late."  I'm not somebody who has had the whole career at 
the VA, so I taught for the University of California, Davis, I actually had my own business on 
the side with consulting and the professional assault response training is part of what I helped 
develop from the '80s, and we do a lot of training to nonviolent, nonaggressive, but deescalating 
situations that can become assaultive.  And we train people how to have self-control and how to 
think about those things, and so I've been involved in that.  I taught.  I helped a lot with 
psychiatric mental health nursing.  Used to be very focused from the days of our founder, who 
was really Hildegard Peplau -- it was very focused on mostly therapeutic interventions, and 
things that were more engaged verbally or behaviorally, and not the biology component.  And so 
incorporating biology into psychiatric mental health nursing was a huge piece of what I focused 
on in the '90s, and making sure that we thought of the brain in total.  Because you as a human 
being and as -- and this is very important for nursing -- you have a brain but you're interacting

with an environment constantly, so everything around you contributes.  And the thing about 
nursing -- I hate to say this, and everybody that knows me kind of laughs, but I am very much in 
love with Florence Nightingale, because Florence Nightingale went to -- well, she never was in 
Crimea, first of all.  And I actually got to see her little room in the fort in Istanbul, where she was 
located and Qatari and you know -- when they took people off the battlefield and put them on 
ships and they sailed across the Black Sea to Istanbul -- if they made that journey, they should 
have a good chance at survival.  When Florence got there about two thirds of them died.  And 
she walked in -- and I know I'm paraphrasing and I know I'm -- but she looked at it and said oh 
my god, this place is filthy.  And she ordered 150 scrub brushes.  That's the first thing she did for 
the military.  And she took the ladies of the evening that she brought with her -- which is what 
became nurses at the time -- you know -- she took them and they cleaned things and they opened 
the windows and she started the first hospital laundry, and she started a dietary service, and she 
started engagement, you know -- therapies, reading to people.  You may have seen the Johnson 
and Johnson commercial about nursing, but you know, they were -- nurses were the ones that 
figured out that babies who had -- that needed sunlight to change the, you know -- biliverdin, 
bilirubin -- change -- oh, shoot, I'm -- it's too early in the morning and my brain is gone.  I need 
that second cup of coffee.  But they figured out that sunlight helped premature babies, and they 
figured out that fresh air helped get -- disseminate the germs, and she figured -- there was so 
much that she changed about the environment of healing, the environment of care.  That's what 
nursing is about.  And if you look at the numbers over the next few months in that hospital, the 
death rate dropped dramatically.  And that's why I think that nursing is really about the 
environment of healing.  That nursing takes into account everything from the food you put into 
your body to the air you're breathing to the family you're interacting with.  Those are all 
components of what we are engaged with, and that may not be -- our physician colleagues are far 
and away better at diagnostics and honing in on the illness, and honing in on the treatment of the 
illness, but if that person doesn't take their medicine because they're afraid or doesn't engage in 
the treatment because of other factors in their family or motivations, or they don't have that will, 
those are things that are going to impact the outcome of that therapy no matter what drugs we 
give or what treatments we might do medically.  And that's what nursing is about to me.  That's 
so incredible. 
 
[73:38] AG:  Absolutely, that humanistic aspect really kind of addressing the patients' needs. 
 
MN:  Mmm-hmm.  And that's what I really love about nursing.  I mean, that's the whole thing in 
a nutshell, and what I love about nursing is that you can do so many things with it.  So, I came to 
the VA 10 years -- okay, we're going on 12 years ago.  And I wanted to finish out my career 
somewhere like this.  The VA.  I had great opportunities.  I saw opportunities within the VA to 
develop programs.  I helped start our residency programs in psychiatric mental health nursing.  
Our nurse practitioner residency.  I've added another residency in post baccalaureate -- new 
nurses that come out that need that transition period.  We've established a transition to practice 
program.  We're going for our accreditation on that this year.  You know, it's just embedding 
education into what we do makes everything better.  It raises the caliber and the quality, and it 
gives nurses often something different to mentor others with and help others.  I really love that 
part of what we do to bring new nurses into the field and to engage them.  Nursing has changed.  
Don't get me wrong.  It's very different than it used to be.  But it's still that environment of 
healing, is your predominant role, and it's very important.

[75:33] AG:  What would you say is the most difficult aspect of your job?  Either your current 
role or the kind of past 12 years with the VA? 
 
MN:  Well, it's different working in government.  That's for sure.  But I love government.  Yeah, 
you know, I've been weird my whole life, so this is probably going to sound weird, but I find 
government incredibly reassuring.  And what do I mean by that?  You know, people want to get 
rid of government and get government out of peoples' lives, but government is the mechanism 
we have chosen in this country to equalize.  To make sure that everybody from -- no matter what 
your background or what your history, has equal opportunity, and I am very reassured by the 
veterans that we care for, that that is incredibly important to them as well.  That there's fairness, 
and we will sometimes drive the general public crazy with our bending over backwards to make 
sure that there's no bias, that there's no favoritism in how we do things, but -- and that is always a 
point of contention, because you have rules in government that are -- regulations.  But you 
know?  That gives you your boundaries and your limits and it makes sure that you reach 
everyone.  And I have to say that it also has been a great honor to walk into a building every day 
where the carpet has this big flag that's kind of -- you know, and it says the price of freedom is 
visible here, and it just feels good to give back to people who -- man, I don't know.  I'm not sure I 
could do some of the things that I've heard of stories from individuals.  I sat with one young man 
when I was first there, and when you asked me about what's difficult -- he was talking about 
when his -- and he hadn't talked about it before, but he was talking about when his Humvee was 
blown up, and he -- you know, what he experienced and what he felt and how he saw his friend -
- his partner, his fellow soldier clearly in need of help in the distance, but when he tried to stand 
up, his arm didn't come with him, and it -- he couldn't figure out how this arm was not attached.  
You know, the explosion and the disorientation and the things at that time, but what was so 
amazing is I didn't even realize he had a prosthesis.  We have done such amazing work with 
prosthetic limbs at this point in time, that I really hadn't noticed that he had a prosthesis until that 
moment when he was talking about it.  And so, while some of the stories have been really tragic, 
and some of the stories about what's happened to people when they come back -- particularly our 
Vietnam veterans -- listening to those stories is difficult, but understanding that we have a place 
to serve people and to make it okay -- I think for those veterans that use the VA a lot, that's 
home, and we're much more of a home than we are just a healthcare system.  Does that make 
sense?  Yeah.  It's one of the things I started to tell you when I was talking about the fires.  One 
of the proudest moments, we put together all of these volunteers to call people and make sure 
they were okay.  And this veteran -- I heard this on TV.  It was just by accident.  He was being 
interviewed by a newscaster, and they said -- what did the VA do for you?  He said well, my VA 
called me and they made sure I was okay, and you know, nobody called my wife from her Blue 
Cross.  And I had to laugh that -- because we're different.  We're a whole service as opposed to 
an insurance company.  The MISSION Act has turned us into a little bit more of an insurance 
company, but -- because we have a lot of community care, but we figured out how to do that 
even within the VA system.  Yeah.   
 
[80:50] AG:  Well, you've touched on this a bit but my last question is what is the most 
rewarding part of your current job?

MN:  There are so many things.  There are just so many things.  The one thing that draws me 
into leadership roles has been the numbers of people that you can impact and the difference you 
can make.  And while I can say that I had a role in decreasing the use of restraints, and I had a 
role in integrating biology into psychiatric nursing, and I've had a role in advocacy and hopefully 
reducing stigma in some small way -- those are all great things in your career, but it doesn't 
impact me as much as just having that one person come back and say you know, I get letters 
from veterans and talk about a nurse that made the difference for them.  Or hearing a story of a 
nurse that went the extra mile and the veteran is thanking them, or the family members that write 
that even though they lost their loved one, the nursing staff made such a difference.  Those 
things, you know, they touch your heart, and that's where you get -- you know, we kind of 
touched on selfcare.  That's been the problem with COVID.  Because a lot of that stuff hasn't 
happened.  You don't get to engage with the family, you don't -- the environment of care is in 
isolation through masks, through shields, through gloves and gowns and you don't get to interact 
in the same way.  And the environment of healing becomes very sterile.  It's very difficult.  But 
nurses are resilient, and so the stories of how nurses went that extra mile to make sure that a 
family member was there, get an iPad so they could see the family visually or to be there for 
their last words and hold the hand of somebody who is dying and being that person -- those 
things are tragic but they also have some rewards built in them.   
 
AG:  Absolutely.  That's so well said.  You know?   
 
MN:  I don't know. 
 
AG:  There's that [inaudible -- 83:24] 
 
MN:  Yeah. 
 
AG:  Gosh, yeah, this is a very difficult time to be having some of these interviews and 
conversations, because of how hard it's been, but it's also very inspiring to hear about the kind of 
commitment for sure. 
 
MN:  Yeah, I hope that we can get back to some level of caring for ourselves differently, because 
I know that our nurses really have taken -- it's taken a lot out of people.  But everybody is caught 
up in the toll its taken psychologically just quarantining and being in isolation and this whole 
year not being able to go places.  I'm a hugger.  I like to hug people.  I haven't been able to hug 
people in a year.  And my other big release, as you've probably guessed -- I've been on every 
continent, I love travel, I've been all around the world.  I've even been to Antarctica, and I love it.  
And I haven't been able to travel.  I had a trip scheduled for France that I have now rebooked 
three times and it's put off until next year, so yeah.  I miss my big outlets.   
 
AG:  Yes, that is very difficult to be grounded and also kind of separated from people, from 
sociality and all that connection.  It's not easy. 
 
MN:  So, as you guessed, I'm also a talker, so I apologize for sort of rambling on.

AG:  No, this has been wonderful.  I'm very, very lucky.  I’m a beneficiary of how well spoken 
you are, and how generous you are with your story.  Thank you so much.  
 
MN:  Oh, I hope it's something that people can listen to and -- I don't know -- gain something 
from.  I don't know what it might be, but -- I tried to answer as truthfully as I possibly could 
without completely embarrassing myself.  Because guess what?  There are some mistakes that I 
made too along the way.   
 
[85:43] AG:  No, this has been wonderful.  And is there anything that you wanted to add before 
we conclude?  
 
MN:  No.  I just want to say that I guess -- I said no and then I changed my mind.  You know, 
being a nurse is probably the best thing and best career choice I could have stumbled into.  I 
knew I wanted medicine, I didn't know it was nursing, but nurses are everywhere.  And nursing, 
as I indicated, gave me all the tools to deal with a public life in a council role, and an elected job.  
I mean, there's just so much that I've gotten out of nursing that has changed my life.  And when 
people think of nurses they tend to think of the bedside nurse, and I would really encourage 
future generations to think that it is probably one of the best and most rewarding professions that 
you could ever have and you can do so many things with it. 
 
AG:  Absolutely.  Thank you so much, Mary Ann. 
 
MN:  Absolutely.  It's been a pleasure. 
 
AG:  My pleasure.
