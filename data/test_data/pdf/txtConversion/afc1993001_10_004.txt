ETHNIC HERITAGE & LANGUAGE SCHOOLS PROJECT, 1982
 
HOOPA VALLEY INDIAN RESERVATION
 
In northwest California's Humboldt County,  the lower course of the Trinity
 
River flows northerly through Hoopa Valley. The principal twelve mile square
 
section of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation (
1) is characterized by hills and
 
canyons surrounding the valley floor, which was created by the Trinity River. This
 
river has been designated a 'wild river' by the State of California (2). The valley
 
is isolated by mountain ranges on -the east and west and by river gorges on the
 
north and south.
 
The Reservation is rich in natural resources. Animals that are still hunted
 
include deer, squirrel, woodrat, black bear, fox, raccoon, rabbit and puma. T
T
 
renowned fish resources of northwest California 1s wild rivers include salmo
 
trout, sturgeon, suckers and eel. The main plants utilized as foods by the Indian
 
people are several varieties of acorn producing oaks, pine nuts, lily bulbs, other
 
nuts and many berries.  In their non-subsistence technology, the Indian people
 
utilize animal by-products, such as skins, antlers, feathers, bone and shell, as
 
well as plant material in woodworking and basketry.  (

The Hupa (4) are Athabaskan speaking Indians who continue to occupy a major
 
portion of their pre-contact territory, which was set aside as a Reservation in
 
1864, only a generation or two after white contact. This geographical and cultural
 
continuity and relative lack of disruption (
compared with other California Indian
 
groups) are major factors in the modern situation where continuous language and
 
cultural traditions exist as part of the present Native American way of life at
 
Hoopa.
 
The 1980 U
.S. Census declared that more Native American people live in
 
California than in any other state. And California's largest Indian Reservation,
 
both in terms of territory and population, is the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation.
 
Living on this Reservation are approximately 1000 Hupa Tribal members, 800 other
 
S

Indian people, and 2200 non-Indians, for a total of 4,000 inhabitants of Hoopa
 
Valley.
 The Hoopa Valley Business Council, a Tribal Council for the Hupa
 
people, maintains a Hupa Tribal Roll listing 1640 Tribal members.  (
5)
 
The educational system at Hoopa began with a reservation school in the 1870's
 
and an Indian Boarding School in 1893. The  Hoopa Boarding School became a day
 
school in 1932.
 Presently the Hoopa High School and the Hoopa Elementary
 
School, both public schools in the Klamath-Trinity School District of Humboldt
 
County, serve the needs of the Valley residents.
 
It is important to note the early philosophy of the educational systems at
 
Hoopa concerning the education of Indian people. About 1880, the military agent at
 
Fort Gaston in command of the Reservation, devoted his attention to the '
assimilation'
 
of the Hupa. "If persuasion would not induce the Indians to change, the agents were
 
told to withhold rations, and if necessary, use other means to reach the desired
 
end." (Nelson 1978:117) The Boarding School emphasized '
practical'  skills, and
 
instruction in manual (
or menial) labor made up 50% of the curriculum (farming,
 
laundry, cooking, sewing).  (6)
 
Some of the Elders today recall the punishments for speaking the Indian
 
language at the Boarding School.
 
We used to get punished for talking Indian at school.  I know many times I
 
couldn't come home because I got caught talking Indian. My dad used to
 
bring the horse. He'd come by horseback. He'd come up there, and I
'd tell
 
him, "I can't go home."  "What's the matter?"  I said, "I talked Indian."
 
"Oh,  pshaw!" Everything would be '
Oh, pshaw' with him.  (Alice laughs.)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70 (
7)
 
The memory of the educational system's harsh attitude to the Hupa language is
 
alive today in anyone who
 attended the Boarding School, that is, anyone over
 
60 today who was born before approximately 1925. Many if not most of the Elders
 
learned the harsh lesson well, and wouldn't teach the language to their children,
 
in order to spare the children from criticism and punishment.
 
When I was growing up, my parents' attitude was not to give us anything from
 
4
 Davis
 
our culture. They were punished at the time. They couldn't talk their
 
language to their people. My grandmother raised me.  She said that when she
 
went to school, they were punished for talking their language. They had
 
to learn English, and they learned it real fast.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41 (

The transmission of Hupa language skills in the home was so throttled by the
 
physical and social sanctions against native language and culture, that the
 
renewal of language skills within the Tribe had effectively come to a standstill
 
in 1970 when the first formal language classes were initiated. Today there are
 
10 to 15 '
Native Speakers' of Hupa, all of whom are over 60 years old.  (9)
 
However since 1970, the social movement to increase language awareness and
 
skills in a more general atmosphere of an '
Indian Renaissance' has sowed the seeds
 
of a hopeful future for the preservation and teaching of the Hupa language.
 
THE HUPA LANGUAGE PROGRAMS
  
In the school year of 1981-82, there were five language programs active on
 
the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, and a sixth related program at Humboldt
 
State University in Arcata, California, a one and a half hour drive from Hoopa
 
to the coast.
 
In order of the age groups served by each program, from youngest to oldest,
 
these are the six Hupa Indian language programs. It should be noted that these are
 
also the only classes for the Hupa language that exist anywhere.

There is currently no Hupa language program available in the Hoopa High
 
School. There was a program in the High School taught by Elmer Jarnaghan, a Nati e
 
Speaker, until his death in 1980, and carried on until 1981 by his daughter, Marge
 
Colegrove. However,  there is not now a High School language program, and there
 
are no plans for one in the future. Presumably these students could attend the
 
Career Center language classes which are held at night, but in fact,  there are no
 
High School students in that class.
 
This report will describe in detail the language program #2 at the Day
 
Care Center. First,  there will be an overview of the other five language
 
programs,  presented in order by age of students,  from youngest to oldest, as in

.  Hoopa Valley Pre-School
  
The Hoopa Valley Pre-School is located in its own building across from the
 
Bureau of Indian Affairs office on the area of the Reservation called the
 
'
campus'.  (11) The language program was introduced into this school approximately
 
two to three years ago, when the Center for Community Development, hereafter
 
referred to as CCD,  (12) and Alice Pratt--a Native Speaker, Elder, and Tribal
 
Medicine Woman-- began to develop a language program for small children.
 
This school runs on a nine month school year calendar, with a half day
 
session in the morning and another half day session in the afternoon. The morning
 
session is the only one with a language class. Alice Pratt comes in at approximately
 
9
:30 or 10 AN and teaches the children gathered into one group,  for twenty minutes,
 
twice a week, on Wednesday and Thursday, after which she is driven to the Day Care
 
Center for its language program. The children at the Pre-School range in age from
 
two years nine months to five years. Approximately forty Pre-School children in the
 
1981-82 school year participated in the language program at some time. An average
 
class consisted of fifteen children, although at times there were thirty children
 
in the class. The language class is held in the Pre-School's  '
language room',
 
6
 Davis
 
which displays the English alphabet, numbers and houses the library.
 
The teaching system that Alice used in each class consisted of teaching the
 
children to count one to ten, naming the body parts in Indian, and finishing
 
each class with the students singing "The Bear Went Over The Mountain" in the
 
Hupa language.
 
About once a month, Dr. Ruth Bennett of the CCD would accompany Alice to
 
the class, bringing animal puppets for the children to play with after the regular
 
language class. This would involve the children learning the animal names in Hupa,
 
and taking on the character of the animals in play acting.
 
On special occasions, another Elder who spoke the language would come in
 
and make a presentation to the children. Rudolf Socktish, the Hupa spiritual
 
leader, sang and played the traditional drum in the class once.
 
The children have been enthusiastic about the language classes, although
 
their attention span has been strained over the year. The parents
 feel very
 
good about the '
idea' of their children learning the Indian language, although
 
for the most part the parents haven't involved themselves in the classes per se.
 
One child's parents indicated that their child not be included in the language
 
class. They felt that this form of teaching Indian language was belittling, and
 
that if the child were to learn the language, it should be done at home. In general,
 
however, there was a very positive attitude among the parents toward this class.
 
The teachers at the Pre-School all supported the idea of the children learning
 
the Indian language, and all but one participated in the program, by gathering the
 
children together when Alice arrived, and by encouraging the children in their
 
language efforts at other times.  Several of the teachers felt that there should be
 
improvements in the teaching methodology for pre-school age children. The program
 
as it
 exists was developed several years ago and the teachers would now like
 
to contribute their expertise in early childhood development to the language
 
skills of Alice Pratt and the language teaching experience of CCD.

Some of the teachers'  ideas include working the language curriculum into a
 
pre-school format by integrating the auditory skills now required, with visual
 
aids and movement. The pre-school program as it now exists, prepares the children
 
for the elementary school program by giving them a familiarity with the sounds
 
of the language and by providing them with a basic vocabulary.  (

. Hoopa Elementary School  
For approximately ten years, until the end of this 1981-82 school year
 
when this program was discontinued, there has been a Hupa language program
 
run by the Klamath-Trinity School District, in the Hoopa Valley Elementary
 
School. Eleanor Abbott has been the teacher, paid by the School District.
 
She has a special teaching credential, called the Eminent Domain Credential
 
(
EDC). The State of California has a provision for this credential when no
 
university offers a degree program in a needed field, and there is a person
 
available with that expertise. Elmer Jarnaghan was the first Native language
 
speaker in the Hoopa area to receive the EDC. He taught in the High School until
 
his death in 1980. Eleanor Abbott had worked in the CCD for Tom Parsons and learned
 
the Unifon alphabet which was being used there to record the Indian languages of
 
northwest California. Tom Parsons encouraged the School Board to consider Eleanor
 
for the EDC, and together Tom  and the K-T District petitioned the State for her
 
credential.. Although Eleanor was not a Native Speaker, the credential was awarded
 
with the understanding that she would improve her language proficiency. While
 
Elmer was teaching in the High School, Eleanor taught Indian language in the
 
Elementary School.
 
8
 Davis
 
Because of the nature of this special credential, Eleanoi
as only qualified
 
to teach Indian language classes, which she supplemented with cultural enrichment
 
programs. There are two other Indian Cultural Specialists in the Elementary
 
School, Anthony Risling and Cathy Colegrove, who carry out a variety of cultural
 
enrichment programs, but do not teach the Hupa language. Eleanor's classes
 
were elective for the students in
 Kindergarten through third grade, required
 
parental permission, and were held during the regular class hours. The students
 
who signed up for these classes left their regular classrooms and went to Eleanor's
 
room for the language class. She used curriculum materials developed by CCD,
 
using the Unifon alphabet. For the last two to three years, many students in
 
her classes have come into this program with language skills learned from Alice
 
Pratt in the Pre-School and Day Care language programs. With flash cards and drill,
 
Eleanor reinforced the pre-school skills through repetition. As far as I could
 
learn, there has been no communication between Alice and Eleanor concerning the
 
skills taught in the pre-school age groups so that Eleanor would have a basis
 
for follow-up programs. The emphasis of the class was on vocabulary development
 
and cultural enrichment.
 
There has been no problem among parents with permission required for their
 
children to enroll in this class. The children have been enthusiastic about the
 
idea of learning Indian language. However, the classes have only been filled for
 
half of the class periods of the day, and about half of the 150 students that
 
start the program dropped out by the end of the school year. Some reasons for this
 
have been lack of communication and encouragement between the regular classrooms,
 
the home and the language class. When a student leaves the regular classroom in
 
these early grades, it is often treated as a disruption. And if the student
 
decides to stop going to language class, the parents do not often put pressure on
 
the child to stay in the class.
 
It was amidst controversy that the School Board voted to discontinue this
 
10
 Davis
 
philosophical and professional concerns of the School Board, and the pressing
 
need of the Indian community to gain the School Board's cooperation in preserviñ
 
and passing on what may otherwise be a dying language heritage.  (

 were two Indian language classes run simultaneously at the Hoopa Valley
 
L
J.ementary School in the 1981-82 school year. The Eleanor Abbott program was run
 
by and paid for by the Klamath-Trinity School District. The other program was
 
elective, run and paid for by CCD, and taught by Marge Colegrove with the assistance
 
of Marion Mooney.
 
Marge Colegrove is the daughter of the late Elmer Jarnaghan, a Native Speaker
 
of 1
-
lupa, who was the first credentialed (EDC) teacher of Indian language in Hoopa
 
Valley.  In 1972, Marge attended Elmer's language class offered in Hoopa Valley
 
through the auspices of the College of the Redwoods (
the Junior College in
 
Eureka), for two years. In 1974 Elmer asked her to assist him in the High School
 
language classes, so the K-T School District employed her.  In 1978, she effectively
 
took over Elmer's classes, although he remained active as her consultant. Elmer
 
passed away in 1980. In 1981 she resigned from the High School, and although there
 
was some effort to keep a High School program going with Eleanor Abbott, the
 
school felt that the enrollment was too low to continue the classes. Therefore
 
since 1981 there have been no Indian language programs at all for High School
 
students, and there are no plans for any future High School programs.
 
Marge has tried twice to convince the K-T School Board to petition the state
 
for an EDC on her behalf, but to no avail. When Elmer passed away, the Board felt
 
that they already had a credentialed teacher in Eleanor Abbott to take his place,
 
so they wouldn't credential Marge. There has been community support for credentialir
 
Marge. Tom Parsons of the CCD has appeared before the Board twice on her behalf,
 
and the High School students presented a petition to the school to reinstate Marge.
 
The School Board has asked for Marge's class to give a language performance
 
11
 Davis
 
S
 
S
 
to prove to them the quality of the program. This irritates Marge who feels
 
singled out from the other teachers and classes who have never been asked to givè
 
a performance of skills. The school's philosophy is now against pull-out programs,
 
so there have been problems with scheduling Marge's classes, and suggestions that
 
she offer her classes before and after school and during lunch period, which
 
she feels is unfair to her and the students. There has also been the suggestion,
 
based on the philosophy against pull-out programs, that Marge sit in a section
 
of an ongoing class and teach a few of the students, which she feels would be
 
distracting to the regular class and to the learning of this very difficult
 
Indian language.
 
Marge has become frustrated and disillusioned with the school system after
 
teaching there for eight years without the acknowledgement of a credential. She
 
says that what makes her return each fall are the kids who show the willpower
 
to overcome school resistance to this class, and who are determined to learn the
 
Indian language. However she feels that the language will not die, as about 200
 
students have now been in the classes and have their notes. Her four children
 
are learning the language from her, and will certainly carry it on.
 
In 1981-82 Marge's classes were held in the Reading Lab of the Elementary
 
School, a facility shared with the Johnson O
'Malley Program. There were two
 
sessions, five days a week, a class before school hours from 8
:15-9 AN, and
 
a class during the school day in the 5th elective period from 1
:15-2 PM.
 
Eightteen students were enrolled in this program, eight 8th graders,  seven or
 
eight students in a combined 4th/5th grade class, two 6th graders.
 For a while
 
there were five 7th graders who stopped coming because they shared the class with
 
the 8th graders with whom there was too much tension. The students in these classes
 
have generally been enrolled in earlier language classes, although no students have
 
reached the 4th grade level with the previous experience of the pre-school age
 
language programs, as these have only been in existence for a few years.
 
Next year, without the Eleanor Abbott classes for the Kindergarten through
 
3d graders, Marge will be responsible for more grade levels in the Elementary
 
School. At that time the school will provide the space and non- curriculum materials
 
for the class,  and CCD will provide the salaries for Marge and Marion and the
 
curriculum materials for the classes.  CCD uses this class as a lab setting to
 
develop curriculum materials for the HSU Bilingual Credential Program. Marion
 
Mooney who holds a California Teaching Credential,  acts as the curriculum specialist
 
in the class.  She helps Marge take the concepts and skills t
ilat she wants to
 
teach-, and develops ways to introduce them in the curriculum, for instance in a
 
game format.
 
Marion is not a Native Speaker,  although she is learning the language. Marge

their family's Elders as resource people who can teach them Hupa.  Some of the
 
Elders who did not speak Indian to their own children, are now encouraged to
 
speak the language to their grandchildren or great -grandchildren who are
 
enthusiastically acquiring language skills. This cross-generational feedback
 
provides the opportunity for the children to apply their new skills, creates
 
a language learning environment in the home, and encourages and reinforces the
 
children in learning more about their language and culture.  (

. Hoopa Valley Business Council, Adult Career Education Center (Career Center)
 
The Indian language class that serves the adult community at Hoopa i
s
 
administered by the Hoopa Valley Business Council's (16) Adult Career Education
 
Center, commonly referred to as either the Hupa Tribal Career Center, or simply
 
as the Career Center, which is located behind the Neighborhood Facility. For the
 
forty weeks of the school year, a class is held once a week from 7-10 PM. The
 
language program was introduced into the Career Center's schedule in 1980. The
 
Career Center's program of adult education and basic skills began in 1979.
 
Adrian Drake is the Director of the Career Center. She had previously worked
 
for CCD as a Vocational Counselor in 1973, and in 1974 for Tr -County (The Indian
 
Manpower program for Humboldt, Del Norte and Siskyiou Counties).  She is not a Native
 
Speaker, although her mother, Lila Colegrove is. She understands Hupa if the
 
Elders speak to her slowly.  (Consequently they speak rapidly when they don't
 
want her to understand.) Adrian is one of the two Brush Dance Medicine Women
 
in the Tribe (
17).
 
In 1981, the Career Center- contacted Dr. Victor Golla of George Washington
 
University in Washington, D
.C., who had written Hupa Grammar (
1970) as  his
 
PhD disseracion at the University of California at Berkeley in the Department of
 
Linguistics. He is the only living author on the language. He has been very willing
 
to work with the Tribe, and spends his summers at Hoopa.  In 1981, the Tribe
 
contracted him to complete a Hupa Language Dictionary, whose preparation i
s the
 
14
 Da-is
 
core of the language classes at the Career Center.
 
The Career Center language class serves two functions  the Elders work on
 
the dictionary, and community members observe and participate in this process,
 
thereby learning the language. This class is very different from the other Hupa
 
language classes, in that there is no '
teacher' and no lesson plan.. At the beginning
 
of each session, either Adrian or another class member chooses a section of the
 
dictionary, and Adrian reads that section one word at a time. The Elders then
 
the word
 
say I in Hupa several times, so the class can practice the sounds which don't
 
exist in English, and the specific pronunciation of the word. Often discussion
 
will result about a word, what it means, another Hupa word that they had used for
 
this item, the context of its use, a controversy between the Elders over o
ri
 
of these issues, sometimes a song, a story or formula, and sometimes a comple
 
digression.
 
This manner of conducting the class is flexible, low key and non-threatening
 
to people many of whom aren't used to or comfortable in a standard classroom
 
situation.  In some ways, it is similar to the manner of interacting in an
 
informal gathering in an Indian home. There is much humor and laughter. The pace
 
is determined imperceptibly by the mood of the class as a whole. Sometimes the
 
class lasts 45 minutes, sometimes three hours or more. People will often stay after
 
class to socialize and discuss language and culture anecdotally (
e.g. Some Elder
 
in a family told a student something that he wanted to check out, or a student
 
heard something at a ceremony, what did it mean.) Coffee is available during class,
 
and at some point is served deferentially to the Elders.
 
There has been a maximum of about 33 students in a class, although the
 
average is closer to 15 students.  In the spring of 1982 (
18), the Elders
 
participating in the class were Lila Colegrove, Mrytle Moon and Pearl Randall, al
lS
 
Native Speakers.
 In the past, other Native Speakers who were involved in the class
 
included Rudolf Socktish, Alice Pratt, Clarissa Stone, Jimmy Jackson, and Evelyn
 
15
 
Davis
 
S
 
0
 
Marshall. According to Adrian,  there are approximately 60 Native Speakers of
 
some proficiency in Hoopa. According to Elsie Ricklefs, the Tribal Chairman, Elder
 
and Native Speaker, there are only ten to fifteen Native Speakers, all over the
 
age of 60 years old. This difference of opinion probably reflects a different
 
definition of language proficiency, as Adrian's list includes people that Elsie
 
has explicitly excluded. (9) (Adrian's list is appended)
 
The three Elders now participating in the class are paid by the  Career
 
Center from the BIA's Adult Education Program funds. No one else in the class
 
is paid. One student this spring, Tammy Hostler, was receiving college credit
 
from HSU's Bilingual Program in which she is a student.
 
In 1980 CCD asked the Career Center to use the language class as a lab to
 
develop language curriculum and concepts. In turn CCD paid some Elders to
 
participate in the class and offered college credits for class participation.
 
This association ended in 1981 amidst controversy, and there has been no further
 
association with CCD.
 
16
 
Davis
 
The Career Center's class is unique among the six Hupa language classes,
 
in that it is the only one not affiliated with CCD and the only one that doesn't
 
use the Unifon alphabet. When Victor Golla presented the idea of the Dictionary
 
to the Tribe, they decided to use the Modified International Phonetic Alphabet,
 
which the Career.Center now uses. This has caused some confusion, which could be
 
aggravated if there was ever a coordination of effort among the various language
 
efforts and their two alphabet systems. The Elders were not comfortable with
 
the Unifon alphabet and supported Victor in his decision to abandon it in favor
 
of the more familiar looking Modified International Phonetic Alphabet. However
 
at this point, the only person who can listen to Hupa and record it in the MIPA
 
i
s Victor. There are several people who can record the language in Unifon:
 
Ruth Bennett, Marge Colegrove, probably Eleanor Abbott, and the HSU Bilingual
 
Program students.
 
This summer of 1982 when Dr. Golla arrives,  there will be workshops run
 
in the' manner described above, but on an irregular schedule. The weekly classes
 
will resume in the fall.
 
The Tribal Council supports language efforts in theory but has not allocated
 
money to any of the language programs.  It has contracted Dr. Golla to complete t
 
dictionary. The Tribe has been involved in litigation for years, trying to save
 
the Valley's resources for the people. Therefore even though education is stated
 
to be a high priority, it is a low priority in terms of funding. And within the
 
area of education, the Career Center has given priority to getting High School
 
diplomas for its students. There are many people in positions of power at Hoopa,
 
Tribal Council members and members of the Tribe's Education Committee, who believe
 
that the language is dying and should not be supported, since Indian language
 
skills won't get anyone into college, or get a job, or help support a family.
 
S

This attitude finds employable skills worthwhile, and views language classes as an
 
extra and somewhat frivolous activity with low funding priority in an era of
 
dwindling budgetary resources.
 
In general, Tribal members believe that the language is important, whether
 
most
 
they participate or not. However,/families don't follow up on a child's interest
 
in learning Hupa by speaking and encouraging the Indian language in the home.
 r
 
do they encourage the child to be around Hupa speaking people, nor come into
 
classrooms and learn the language with the child.
 
Adrian is an enthusiastic supporter of recording and preserving the Hupa
 
language.  It is of prime importance to define and encourage the unique nature
 
of this group of poeple. The alternative is integration and assimilation into
 
white society, with the loss of a unique self-esteem. Hupa people often have trouble
 
with the English language because of the background of the Hupa language, whether
 
or not they speak it. They are made to feel inferior when they speak and write
 
broken English, and this engenders a low self-concept. Politically, the Indians of
 
the Valley have been battling to conserve their natural resources, such as the
 
Trinity River water which is threatened by the Peripheral Canal issue, and the
 
salmon whose numbers dwindle every year, in order to sustain the Hupa religion
 
and its ceremonial life, as well as to contribute to the subsistence economy of
 
the Valley people. The religion is intimately tied into the language, as the
 
ceremonies are conducted in Hupa, and the spirits speak to the Medicine Women,
 
Alice Pratt and Adrian Drake, in Hupa. For these educational, psychological,
 
political and religious reasons, Adrian has continued her efforts to preserve
 
and pass on the Hupa language. (

About i-years.ago, Tom Parsons started language programs for the four Indian
 
groups of northwest California, the Hupa, Karok, Yurok and Tolowa people, through
 
the Center for Community Development (
CCD) at HSU in Arcata, California. Tom
 
adapted the Unifon alphabet, which had previously been used to record the Cherokee
 
Indian language and was used in government coding efforts, as a way of recording
 
the local Native languages.  In 1976 he  hired Ruth Bennett who received her PhD
 
in Education from U.C. Berkeley in 1980, to take over this effort as the CCD was
 
diversifying its interests. Ruth has worked on and off,
 until her present
 
position two years ago as Director of the Bicultural Language Program at HSU.
 
This is a credential granting program which teaches people to be teachers of one
 
of the four Indian languages of northwest California. The Credential will allow
 
the person to teach both Indian language courses as well as standard curriculum
 
courses in the public school system. This program may effectively eliminate the
 
argument for petitioning the state for EDC's (
see language programs #3 and 4).
 
While Ruth works with all four Indian groups, she lives in Hoopa, and uses
 
it as a laboratory situation. CCD supports five of the six Hupa language programs,
 
with funds or curriculum. It pays the salary of the language teachers in th
 
Pre-School, Day Care and Elementary School Extra-Curricular Programs.  It
 
administers the HSU Bilingual Program and has provided curriculum materials for
 
all of these programs as well as the Eleanor Abbott program in the Elementary
 
School. CCD has developed curriculum materials and supported teachers and language
 
students in preparing curriculum materials.  It puts on workshops periodically for
 
teachers in Hoopa, centered on curriculum and not on theory.
 
Although no Credentialed teachers have yet graduated from the HSU program to
 
come back to the Hoopa community, former Day Care and Pre-School teachers have left
 
their jobs to enter this program where they are now students. Ruth has also played
 
a key personal role in recording and preserving the Hupa language, in encouraging
 
Elders to participate in all the language programs, and in actively encouraging the

Klamath-Trinity School Board, the Tribal Council and its various departments to
 
recognize the important role that the native language could and should play in
 
Hupa society.(20)
 
HUPA M -JE-E-D N DAY CARE CENTER
 
The Day Care Center is a department of the Hoopa Valley Business Council,
 
commonly called the Hupa Tribal Council. The Center is located in the Neighborhood
 
Facility and is an all day program serving children from two to seven years old.
 
This is the only one of the six programs that runs continuously throughout the
 
year, that is, the only program with summer classes. Alice Pratt teaches Indian
 
language twice a week at the Day Care Center, Wednesday and Thursday from 11 to
 
12 AN. She is driven here in the Headstart van from the Pre-School where she teaches
 
just before this time on the same days.
 
Upon arriving, Alice goes to the kitchen area where Charlotte Colegrove,  the
 
cook and also a Hupa speaker, has a cup of coffee for her. They chat and then
 
Alice enters the classroom with her coffee. The class is held in the room where
 
lunch is later served, and it is closed off for the class. The students are
 
brought in by the teachers,  in groups of three to six. Each class lasts from ten
 
to twenty minutes, and the next group of children is then brought in. One to
 
four classes are held per hour, depending on how many students are in school that
 
day. Alice may be the only adult in the room, however one of the Day Care teach
 
usually observes, Sherry Nixon or Laura Latham. They often tell the children that
 
if they are good, they will get a sticker. On Thursdays, Ruth Bennett will often
 
accompany and assist Alice, and bring specially made high quality puppets of the
 
animals from Indian legends.
 
Alice follows a standard procedure.  She chats with the children as they enter.
 
She is sitting at a table shaped like a kidney bean, in the concave section. The
 
children sit in chairs arranged on the convex outside of the table facing Alice.
 
Alice generally starts the class by counting one to ten,  first saying the number
 
20
 
Davis
 
in English,  then in Indian, while pointing to her fingers. As the children are
 
quite proficient in this exercise, Alice will often have them repeat the counting
 
if their attention wanders or they misbehave. Counting is a familiar guidepost
 
to which Alice returns them in order to focus their attention.  She then enumerates
 
the body parts, first in English, then in Hupa, while pointing to the part of the
 
body with her hand: feet, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, tongue, hand, fingernails, elbow,
 
arm, leg, knee, toenails, shoulder, back, ribs, stomach, hair, eyelashes, backbone,
 
neck, jawbone, head,  false teeth, teeth, cheeks, calf, eyebrows, forehead, liver,
 
navel..
 
Interspersed in this routine, Alice interacts with the children in Indian,
 
with such phrases as: I told you, don't bother that, sit down, don't do that,
 
I
'm leaving, I
'll see you again, I am talking, wait a minute, do you understand,
 
what is it, what are you saying, what are you doing, I
'm glad to see you, how
 
are you, shut your mouth, you got no ears (
scolding to child), I
'll do that
 
today,:don't say that, you're scared, it stinks, you crazy Indian you.
 
She also will include stories about life when she was a child, about what
 
it was like to live an '
Indian'  life in the old days: the difficulty of gathering
 
acorns and finding deer to kill and the patience it took to fish, how her father
 
caught a sturgeon in his net, how the old Indian people reprimanded children for
 
interrupting, how the children were punished for speaking Indian in Boarding
 
School, how strict the Boarding School was.
 
The class has come to an end when Alice or the Day Care teacher who i
s
 
observing, indicates that the children should sing "The Bear Went Over The
 
Mountain", which they boom out in Indian with great delight. The teachers often
 
give the children stickers at this point as rewards for being good in class.
 
If Ruth Bennett has brought the puppets, she will then hand them out and
 
encourage the children in play acting with the animals, using their Hupa names
 
if possible: bear, eagle, red-headed-woodpecker, etc. The following is a scenario
 
from one of the puppet playing sessions.  (

During the class itself, Ruth may lead the children in the correct Hupa
 
response to Alice's questioning in English, as well as disciplining the children
 
in the proper respect for Alice: pay attention, show respect, don't be silly,
 
don't bother things-- both in English and in Indian.
 
Alice Pratt i
s one of a dozen Native language speakers in Hoopa. She is a
 
respected Elder and a Medicine Woman in religious ceremonies. Her family came
 
from an area in Hoopa Valley that is just below her present house. Her parents
 
spoke Hupa in the home, and she didn't learn English until she went to the Boarding
 
School in Hoopa. She often tells the story of being punished for talking Indian
 
at Boarding School.
 
Years ago we used to get punished for talking Indian. Oh, we went to
 
Boarding School. And then Friday comes, well, you can go home. Come back
 
Sunday. And then if you're caught talking Indian language, you can't go
 
home. Um-hm. And that's what they done to us. We had one little spot that
 
we used to go sit in. In that little building they had,  there was a
 
basement down there. And they cut that off, they closed it. But we could
 
still sit up there. So we used to go up there, and talk to one another.
 
(
She laughs.)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70 (22)
 
The lesson that Alice and the other people in her generation learned was
 
that it was unacceptable to speak Indian, that to move forward into the modern
 
world, they would have to leave behind their Indian culture. They did not speak
 
Indian to their children, except for words and phrases, and their children gr''
 
speaking English, understanding some Hupa when their parents still spoke it t
 
each other, with their own small vocabulary of Indian words and phrases.
 
However,  the old people..
 
clung to the language tenaciously,  those who did
 
speak it. They thought that it was very important. And in any matter of real
 
importance,  that was the language they'd use, because they could express
 
themselves better, people could understand better, because it was much
 
deeper than some of the translations that we had. People on the outside
 
would take verbatim reports. When it came out translated,  it was not really
 
accurate, and did not reflect the true feeling and meaning of what the India
 
people were trying to say.

lice stopped speaking Indian to her own children. She thought it was no good.
 
Her son Alex and her daughter Jean don't speak Hupa, but her son Edgar knows
 
some Indian. However with the resurgence of interest in their heritage among
 
the Hupa people, Alice has begun to teach the language to her great-grandchildren
 
whom she watches, and they are good learners.
 
With the increasing recognition being given to the Native Speaking Elders by
 
Hupa society, younger people in Alice's family have come to her as a resource
 
person in learning the language. Laura Latham, her step-granddaughter, was a student
 
years ago in the Elmer Jarnaghan class at Hoopa High School. After she graduated
 
from High School, she began losing her skills due to lack of opportunity for
 
application. She went to Alice and tape recorded her speaking Hupa. Laura now
 
works at the Day Care Center where she assists and observes in the language classes.
 
Her son,
, T
.R., is one of the Day  Care students. Before she worked in the Day
 
Care, T
.R. came home with Indian words, and this made her proud. She has made
 
the effort to improve her own language skills, by listening to the tapes that
 
Alice made for her, by using Hupa in the home and by encouraging T
.R.  to speak
 
Hupa as well. Laura is proud to be an Indian, and to participate in Indian culture.
 
She is proud that in her generation, she has the opportunity to learn and speak
 
the language after it's been gone so long.  (
24)
 
It was about three years ago when Ruth Bennett of CCD came after A
iic
 L
 
ask her to teach Indian language to little children. This was the f
ir
 
that Alice had actually taught the language. Until this time, she spoke Indian
 
to other older people, with minimal cross-generational language transmission.
 
The interest in passing on the language, the seeking out of younger people, and
 
the development of a new set of roles in the language context, adding those of
 
teacher-student to the old role set of Elder Native Speaker-Elder Native Speaker,
 
are major social developments that have accompanied the actual cultural increase
 
in language skills.

The language class at the Day Care Center which enjoys great community
 
approval and prestige, due in large part to the reputation, language skills and
 
personality of Alice Pratt, has been unusually successful in sustaining a
 
widespread cooperative effort among various agencies within the Hupa Tribe, as
 
well as with outside agencies at the University. The contribution of each agency
 
to this cooperative effort in the Day Care language class, is described below.
 
The Day Care Center
  
Marsha Feinland was the Director of the Center until July 1
,  1982, when this.
 
program was consolidated with the Johnson O
'Malley Program and Headstart under
 
the Directorship of Elizabeth Pratt Marshall. The language program was
 
into the Center several years ago. The Center functions to facilitate
 
in terms of making-time in-the children's schedule for the langiage class, by
 
providing the van and the physical facility for the class. The staff, which is all
 
Indian except for Marsha, accomodates cultural programs by giving them priority
 
over the regularly scheduled activities, and by changing their own schedules when
 
necessary. The staff thinks it's important for the children, who are almost all
 
Indian, to learn about their own culture.  (25)
 
Johnson O
'Malley Program
  
Leslie Campbell works with Elders in developing curriculum materials for the
 
Pre-School and Day Care Centers. This is a Cultural enrichment program not
 
specifically tied into the language program, although clearly related. Leslie
 
is in the process of making up a Cultural Book,  in which learning exercises, such
 
as connect the dots, shape games, and identification of like items, are illustrated
 
with local plants, native basket designs, elkhorn spoons, recipes for Indian
 
food, and legends from local oral tradition, instead of the standard cultural
 
inventory from Anglo-American society. Leslie is a parent of children in the
 
Day Care program and is involved in its parent committee. CCD works with this
 
program, because of its interest in bicultural curriculum materials, but there

Headstart
  
Elizabeth Marshall was Interim Director of the Headstart Program until
 
July 1
, 1982 when she becamelinterim Director of the Consolidated Program
 
including the Day Care Center, Headstart and the Pre-School. The Day Care Center
 
was set up from its inception to include a Cultural component, using Reservation
 
people, especially the Elders. Elizabeth believes that the continuity of one
 
teacher, Alice Pratt, in the language program, has maintained the focus on the
 
teaching unit of Alice and the children, and that is a key to the success of this
 
language program. Support for the language program falls into Headstart's educational
 
component and its philosophy of cultural preservation through education. Headstart
 
has paid for the van and gas to pick up Alice. (27)
 
HSU Center for Community Development (CCD)  
Ruth Bennett, Director of the Bilingual Credential Program at HSU, and Assistant
 
to Tom Parsons at CCD, lives in Hoopa, and is a regular visitor in the Day
 
Care's language class. Ruth works with Alice on Thursday afternoons, collecting
 
language data, so she often accompanies Alice to language classes on Thucsday
 
mornings. CCD pays Alice out of a Bilingual Grant to teach and to consult with
 
Ruth on her language research. Ruth may bring in animal puppets, specially made
 
based on the local Indian legends. After a language session, Ruth encourages the
 
children to play act with the puppets, and to learn their Indian names. The
 
children enjoy this very much. Ruth is in the process of developing and working
 
with others to develop curriculum materials to teach language and culture classes.
 
She is also instrumental in arranging for workshops on language curriculum to
 
be held in the Valley, drawing on such resource people as Dr. Pat Wenger of the
 
Anghropology Department at HSU.  (

Tribal Council (Hoopa Valley Business Council)  
Elsie Ricklefs is the Chairman of the Hupa Tribal Government. She is one
 
of the '
full blood'  (29) Hupa people in the Valley, is a Native Speaker of the
 
language, and a highly respected Tribal Elder. She is very thoughtful and
 
articulate about the role of language in Hupa culture. The Tribal Council
 
administers the Day Care Center, however at a budgetary level, and does not involve
 
itself in the daily activities nor in the educational programs of the Center.
 
The Council has discussed the role of language in recording, preserving and passing
 
on the Tribal heritage. Philosophically it supports all language efforts.  In its
 
budget, there is money to promote the language efforts of Dr. Golla in compiling
 
the Hupa dictionary.  (
30)
 
In interviews with Day Care teachers, students, and parents, in conversations 0
 
with community members, it is clear,
 even taking into account specific comments
 
of constructive criticism, that the Day Care language program has earned the
 
highest regard and admiration.
 
Children
  
In interviews and informal conversations with Day Care students from two
 
through six years old, there were two major impressions. First, the children
 
for the most part either liked or were enthusiastic about Alice and the language
 
class.
 
I like the class.
 
Alice is pretty.
 
Alice, did you go to that Brush Dance? I seen you. Were you making the Medicine?
 
I seen you. I seen you too. Me too.  I was there too. Alice I was in the
 
Brush Dance (a boy who was a dancer.), I danced.  Corky and Tsewenaldin, his
 
little boy were in it (dancers).  (
31)
 
Second, the children knew who in their family could speak Indian, which
 
indicates that Hupa is being spoken a
t home, and that the children have learned
 
who will interact with them in Hupa, thereby reinforcing their own language skills,
 
and being a part of creating a home environment where there is pride in the
 
27
 Davis
 
S
 
S

family's heritage.  (
32)
 
Day Care teachers
  
The teachers, who are all Indian, support the language program, are flexible
 
in their own schedules to accomodate any language or cultural activity, and
 
encourage the children to use their language skills outside of class.
 
Sherry Nixon (Head Teacher) is real interested in the language.  She's
 
been in the language class (at Career Center).. .Alice goes in the Day Care
 
class. The teachers aides help get the kids together. At different
 
times there have been specific people appointed to get the kids together,
 
and get the kids in groups. And now Laura (Latham) gets the kids organized
 
and gets them together. We teach the class, and when that group is done,
 
they bring in another group. We get a lot of cooperation in terms of
 
having the class taught, and having it go in an effective way... That's
 
one of the things, besides the fact that Alice is a good teacher, that
 
makes this successful, that the administrators are invisible. Alice and
 
the kids are the focus.
 
Ruth Bennett (33)
 
The teachers think the language class is a very important program. They've
 
been cooperative in accompanying the children to the lessons, and in
 
changing their schedules whenever necessary. Whatever lessons they had
 
planned, they held them in limbo, whatever they needed to do to accomodate
 
the language classes or any cultural programs. All the staff members here
 
are American Indian except for myself, and they all feel that it's very
 
important for the children to learn about their culture.
 
Marsha Feinland (34)
 
Some of the teachers in the past have been so enthusiastic about the value
 
of the language program, that they have quit their jobs to enroll in HSU's Bilingual
 
Credential Program.  (
35)
 
Parents
  
The parents wholeheartedly support the idea of their children learning
 
the Indian language.
 
There was a survey done by Steve Carr, Education Director, of the attitudes
 
of Pre-School and Day Care parents to different  programs. Language got
 
the highest support among 13 different things that the parents were asked
 
their opinion of. Language was either first, second or third choice of all
 
the parents. And it was first choice of a lot of them. There's a lot of
 
interest in the language.

Day Care saying Indian words. This stirs the pride of the parents in the child and
 
consequently in their own feeling of pride in their Indian heritage. The parents
 
then  may be motivated to learn some of the language themselves.
 
Before I started working at Day Care, my son was going there. He came home
 
with Indian words. It just made me  proud that he was learning it.  It
 
made me feel really good.  So I got into it myself so that I could work

language to their people.. .My father speaks the language, but he doesn't
 
talk to us (his children). But now my kids have the opportunity to take the
 
language in the Grammar School. They're learning and that's stimulating him
 
(her father) into talking more to us in our language. With our kids now in
 
Headstart and the pre-kindergarten services, they go home and they stimulate
 
their parents, and so they're able to keep it up. They get interested and
 
they enroll in.our Adult Career Center in the language, in craft making,
 
canoe building, making acorn spoons, making baskets, even making the dresses
 
(used in religious ceremonies), everything, down to arrows.

 Elizabeth Marshall (38)
 
This cross-generational snowballing interest and pride in the heritage
 
started with an Elder who is a language teacher (Alice), moves to young chi1dr n,
 
which encourages the parents' and grandparents' participation and reinforcement
 
through the incorporation of the Indian language and culture in the home and family.

CONCLUSIONS
  
To conclude this report, I would like to reiterate some of the key i
ssues
 
involved in the Day Care language program and in the Hupa language efforts in
 
general, drawing especially on the perceptive comments of the many articulate and
 
concerned community members from taped interviews.

The Reputation of the Day Care Language Program

This widely respected program is perhaps the least controversial of all
 
We had a lot of bugs in the system,  in the cooperation it took.  But working
 
with just one person, with Alice, we were able to make it.  Her whole main
 
goal was to teach the children.

Cross-Generational Language Feedback
 
The dozen or so Native Speakers of the Hupa language are now all over 60
 
or 70 years old.  In their childhood, the Bureau of Indian Affairs administered
 
the Hupa Indians as wards of the government.
 
Unfortunately, when the BIA came in and took over the administration of the
 
Indian people, they were under the mistaken assumption that the Indian
 
people would fit into the mainstream much better if they did not speak
 
their language, or attend their rituals, the whole culture that we had
 
known, our Indian heritage, in order to facilitate that transfer. They
 
felt that if we just became white people, English speaking people, t
hen
 
we would just be accepted into the mainstream of life more readily.
 
However, they had discounted the fact that we had been living this way
 
for thousands of years, and you just don't do it in ten, or twenty, or
 
a hundred years, or two  hundred that we've been under them. That is part
 
of our being, part of our tradition, our heritage.
 
Elsie Ricklefs (43)
 
It was the government Boarding School's responsibility to ensure that the
 
Indian children learned and spoke English.
 
We couldn't go home. We used to go home every Friday.  If we got caught
 
talking Indian language, we couldn't go home. They washed our mouths out
 
with soap too, And it wasn't ordinary soap, it was that lye soap that they
 
used. They made that themselves,  it was lye. Oh that was terrible.
 
Alice Pratt (44)
 
The Indians of that time clung to their language tenaciously.
 
They thought it was very important. And in any matters of real importance
 
that was the language they'd use, because they could express  themselves
 
better, and people could understand better.
 
Elsie Ricklefs (45)
 
However because of the punishments and negative attitudes toward Indian
 
language and culture,  these people didn't pass the language on to their children.
 
I stopped talking Indian to my children.  I didn't bother about it any more.
 
It was no good, I thought. And that's why my son can't say a word of Indian,
 
no matter how much he tries!  (

The consequences have been that the Elders have spoken Hupa to each other, but
 
not cross-generationally.
 
Sometimes I talk Indian to my friends on the phone.  It's lots of fun.  (She laughs).
 
Alice Pratt (

We (
the few Native Speakers of Hupa) talk to each other in all ways, actually.
 
On the phone, or just in meeting one another, or when we have a Tribal
 
group, sometimes we have our Head man come up, our religious leader, Rudolf
 
Socktish. He prefers to speak in his language because he feels more
 
comfortable. And it should be done that way. And I usually interpret for
 
him (

Elsie Ricklefs (50)
 
With the introduction of the language programs in the last ten years or so,
 
the Elders have been encouraged to pass their language and cultural knowledge on
 
to the younger generations who are eager to learn more about their heritage and
 
cultural identity.
 
My father speaks the language. But he doesn 't talk to us (his children
 
But now my kids have the opportunity to take the language in Grammar
 
School. They're learning and that's stimulating him (her father, their
 
grandfather).into talking more to us in our language.
 
Elizabeth Marshall (

The Elders speak the language fluently. The middle generation loses it.
 
Some can speak it, but the majority of them have lost it. And  then the
 
young people are picking it back up again.
 
Leslie Campbell (52)
 
It's a wonderful thing to have Alice teaching Indian language because
 
pretty soon there aren't going to be any more older people like her.
 
If she can teach these young children, and they can learn so fast, it's
 
wonderful. If we didn't have her, and these children weren't learning,
 
there would be nobody in a few more years. There'd be nobody speaking
 
it, and our older people would be gone, and there would be nobody to
 
look back to. Through these programs, tapes and things are being made.
 
It can go on through tapes and boàks, whatever. These kids can go
 
on learning it.

53)
 
The Elders teach the young children, two or three generations removed from
 
themselves, and the children encourage their own parents,  that middle generation
 
deprived of language information, to learn more about the language.
 
Children are not learning their Indian language at home. It's slipped away
 
with a lot of them (the Hupa families). When the parents can hear the
 
ctildren ..
 as young as they are, come home and start speaking Indian, i
t
 
encourages them. They say, I don't even know i
t and my kid's speaking it,
 
and he's younger than I am.
 
Laura Latham (
54)
 
The current generation of parents,  people in their 20's through 40's,  can't
 
speak Indian and can only understand a few words or phrases.
 
People in my generation can only say words,  say  'hello'  to each other,  but
 
not conversations.
 
k s rojj! i
.J,.
 
I
've seen a change in the -
.,
,young people. They want to know the language.
 
They'll sit in here and say,  '
I just love to hear you and somebody else
 
talk.' That's the way to go. And they know it's real .
.. I
've had so many
 
young people t
ell me that.
 
Teaching Methods and Curriculum for Language Classes
  
All the language classes are now serving two functions,  as teaching
 
environments and as lab settings to develop curriculum materials.  There is a
 
general feeling of frustration that the current curriculum and teaching
 
methodologies are not yet adequate to,match the widespread enthusiasm in the
 
community for learning the language.  However,  there is a lot of effort being
 
put into filling these needs, by CCD, by HSU Bilingual Credential students,
 
by Margd
' and Marion,  by JOM, by the Klamath-Trinity School District,  and by
 
Adrian Drake and Victor Golla.

Cooperation and Communication: The Future of the Language at Hoopa
  
Someone once said, "If you want to get rid of a people,  take away
 
their language".
 
Elsie Ricklefs (57)
 
Unfortunately there is very little communication among the various programs,
 
in the sharing of materials, in monitoring student reaction and improvement to
 
different teaching strategies, or in coordinating some of the six language programs
 
into one concerted effort. A coordinated effort would seem to promise a reduction
 
in expenditure and paperwork, the pooling of various resource skills and people,
 
and a channeling of energy and momentum to reach the language goals of the
 
Tribe and community before the dozen Native Speakers, all over 60 years of age,
 
are gone. Three reasons for the cir
.rent lack of communication have surfaced in
 
this research; The Tribe spends a lot of time, money and human resources on important
 
legal cases, leaving little for language or other cultural programs. There is a
 
history of friction among the programs. There are other Indian groups who live in
 
Hoopa Valley, for whom there have never been language classes in the Valley.
 
There is skepticism among some people  whether the language will survive.
 
I doubt that the language will be passed on, I doubt it. No one that I
've
 
heard, who is trying to talk Indian. When I go, I think it's going to be
 
all gone.
 
Alice Pratt (58)
 
The older Native Speakers learned and used the language in many contexts. There
 
are younger people who hope that the language will survive because it is being
 
recorded and preserved.
 
Through these programs, tapes and things are being made.  It can go
 
on through tapes and books (after the old people are gone). These
 
kids can go on learning it.
 
Laura Latham (59)
 
There are now language programs in a school setting, but what needs to happen
 
if the language is to be carried on after the Elders are gone,  is a reinforcement
 
34
 
Day i
 s
 
of language speaking in many contexts:  in the home--
I feel that I
've learned enough. I have four children and I can teach my
 
children. And I feel that the language will live on that way. They can
 
always teach someone else and talk to their friends.
 
Marge Colegrove (60)
 
The Tribal people will tell you they think it's really important, but
 
whether they participate in it klanguage programs) or not is another
 
thing. They don't follow up on it.  If the child learns a word in the
 
Pre-School or the Day Care program, they might think it's really cute.
 
But then no one talks the language in the home. They don't encourage
 
the child to be around other Hupa speaking people. The parents don't
 
come into the school and sit with the child and learn the words themselves.
 
Adrian Drake (61)
 
I use the Indian words in my home a lot, words like sit down, and hurry up,
 
no, yes. Just the few words that I know, and I
'm interested in learning
 
more with the Indian language.
 
Laura Latham (62)
 
in school--
The School's philosophy is to mainstream the cultural and language programs.
 
The more information that the classroom teachers have about the language
 
and the culture, the more opportunities the kids are going to have all day
 
long to have it reinforced.  But if they're just pulled out for a half an
 
hour, having language instruction, and then going back to class, they will
 
not get any reinforcement, as they would if that teacher were their teacher
 
all day long, and has a period of language along with a period of math,
 
a period of reading, etc.
 
Sally Biggin (63)
 
in mass media--
Another plan is to put some of the Hupa language on tapes and produce
 
them over the áir,local]
.y here on the Reservation, on KIDE-FM, the
 
Reservation radio station.
 
Adrian Drake (
64)
 
and at the religious ceremonies.
 
You got to talk to everything you do in that hole (
the Brush Dance pit).
 
So when I come in, I talk to the walls, to the four corners. You pray
 
right there.
 
Alice Pratt, Medicine Woman (65)
 
The language is very important in carrying out the Brush Dances. I feel
 
that I really lack in a lot of things, because I don't understand the
 
language completely. There are so many ancient words that I have no
 
knowledge of. If a spirit came to talk to
 me in the ancie nt language,
 
I wouldn't unde rs tan d it
.
(Ad rjan  later tells me, off the tape, that the
 
spirits are so smart that they must surely have learned English by now,
 
and she laughs.)

Respect for the Cultural Heritage and the Development of a Positive Self-Image
.
 
The sensitive and eloquent statements of Tribal people and community members
 
express the belief that a positive self image is intimately rooted in self-knowledge
 
through cultural heritage.
 
The Tribe's long range goal is to get the people to understand the value of
 
their own
, k
a guage. A very great man said once, "If you want to get rid of
 
a people, take away their language." We realize that that's what could happen.
 
We've seen some erosion of our traditional cultural beliefs by our young
 
people. They just don't know about it. They haven't heard about it through
 
our language. So we see that that can happen. The tragedy of taking away
 
a people's language is that finally they are no longer a people.
 
Elsie Ricklefs (67)
 
Learning the language makes children receptive to learning more of our
 
traditional and cultural, religious beliefs, because then they can realize
 
that we are a people. It's a form of identification which should start at
 
a very early age... It makes them feel very special. That was the harm that
 
was done by the  early government in Indian relationships, they felt that
 
it wasn't worth very much and were ready to discard it. Now we think there is
 
something in it. We are a people. We are an identifiable group. The language
 
reinforces our identity.
 
Elsie Ricklefs (68)
 
The language program is very important to the community, in any community,
 
or for any child, of any nationality or ethnic group to have some awareness
 
of where they  belong, and what the really good points are about their
 
heritage. Because so often children are brought up and they are put down
 
for whatever they are. They don't have a sense of pride, and that's what's
 
really important, the child's self-concept and sense of self-worth. Through
 
having a language program, they can understand part of their heritage, and
 
what they have that's valuable. American Indian languages are so many, and
 
each one has such a small number of people that speak it, that the languages
 
can become lose and this is the only wayy of preserving it.. .
In many cultures,
 
the Elder people are very important. But now in the kind of society we have,
 
people are losing the value and respect they have for their Elders, and this
 
is another form of contact that the children have with an Elder, when Alice
 
comes in and does the classes... It really gives the children a contact and
 
a special feeling for the Elder people.
 
Marsha Feinland (69)
 
The language program gives the children a self-awareness, allows them to
 
discover who they are, where they fit in their society, to live in harmony
 
with the people here. I think it does a lot for them. They know who they
 
are. They have all their resources here, animals,  trees. We're all a part
 
of life, and we all fit together. They see how they fit together in the
 
puzzle, so they know who they are. Their singing and dancing (
the Hupa
 
36
 
Davis
 
religion),  these have more meaning to them than it would to me. Because
 
to me that was a no-no thing, you don't do that. Now it's something that
 
you can do because you are an Indian, because you are you. There's more
 
pride in being an Indian now, than when I was growing up.
 
Elizabeth Marshall (
70)
 
The kids are really proud of what they have to share.
 
Sally Biggin (
71)
 
You teach respect by giving respect. That comes through very well in the
 
language program.  When Elders come in the building, Indian people in
 
general show them a great deal of respect. That says it's OK to be
 
Indian, it's OK to be old,, and it's good to respect other people.
 
John Biggin (
72)
 
I
'm proud to be an Indian and of my culture and my language. Being able
 
to speak some of my language after it's been gone so long, in my
 
generation,  feels good.  It feels good to be able to learn it.
 
Laura Latham (
73)
 
I
'm turning into second grade next year.  I
'm smart.  I talk Indian to the
 
older kids. I
'm learning Indian language good now.
 
Harold Marshall (74)
 
The language is of a prime importance. If we lose our language completely,
 
and we lose our religion completely, then we're going to be just like
 
anyone else. We'll no longer be able to hold our religious dances, our
 
culture. We'll just be completely integrated into the white society.
 
That's the first thing. The second thing that I think that the language
 
is important is this. The reason that a lot of our people have a hard time
 
in school, in getting through school, is that we speak broken English.
 
We have the Hupa language background.  I find this in myself. I write
 
backwards, continually. i have to rewrite and rewrite, continually, because
 
I write backwards, because that's the way the Hupa language is spoken.
 
It has been a hindrance to us, because language is a way to make people feel
 
inferior. If you speak your language and you can't speak adequate English,
 
you're somehow inferior. People make you feel inferior,  they won't say you'r ,
 
inferior. But that has a lot to do with why people have a low self-worth, a
 
low self concept. Therefore the language is very important, that we pick up
 
on it, get the materials, record all the Elders, and preserve as much as
 
we can preserve. Otherwise we're going to lose our whole culture. Then we'll
 
have no special uniqueness, which I feel that we have now.

The Hupa Tribe is attempting to avoid the loss of its language
 
through these language programs, through the education of its chidren. Therefore
 
the language programs involve the whole community, rather than the children alone.
 
The children are the catalysts in this system. They are acted on and in turn they
 
cause reactions in others.
 
The feeling of an Indian identity i
s a complex i
ssue that finds it roots in
 
many '
Indian' experiences, and one of the most '
authentic' ) in the general opinion
 
of the Reservation people, derives from some contact  with the Indian language.
 
It is felt to be '
right' and '
good'  to actively preserve and pass on the language.
 
This moral imperative invests the language programs with a sense of urgency and
 
emotion -
-
 dedication as well as conflict. Many people feel that the future of
 
a Tribal identity, that feeling of '
special uniqueness'  that Adrian Drake talked
 
about,  is fused to the continuity of the language programs. As the language goes,
 
so goes the '
Indian-ness' of the Tribe.
 
Although the language programs were set up to consciously preserve and pa
 
on a traditional part of Indian life, the context of learning has changed, and
 
with it, so has the meaning that the child finds in learning the Indian language.
 
Traditionally, language was learned in the home, in infancy and childhood, as a
 
way of life. Now as that way of life is gone, learning the language takes place
 
in a decidedly Anglo-American style, in a classroom with a teacher, separate from
 
the mainstream of life for these children.  (Fishman 1980) To attend a language
 
class has now become a way for a person to assert his '
Indian'ness'. And in that
 
there is a sense of well-being and worth, which is a consequence of these programs
 
perhaps more valuable more often than the acquisition of language competence which
 
no student has yet attained.
 
The Hupa Indian identity of 1982 has long taproots into the geography of
 
the Valley and the heritage of its ancestral ways. The language classes, a
 
38
 Davis
 
modern development using a non-Indian '
Americanized'  style of teaching and
 
learning, nonetheless strengthens that awareness of the past, and anchors
 
the present to it, so that the Hupa community of today may discover and preserve
 
the unique nature of its identity.

 Native Speaker has a technical meaning, according to Dr. Victor Golla (personal
 
communication), which is, simply stated, someone who still can speak the
 
first language he learned in childhood. However this term is used at Hoopa
 
as a synonym for a fluent speaker. Therefore Elsie Ricklefs who learned
 
English as her first language and learned Hupa when she was about ten years
 
old, is now a fluent speaker. Technically she is not a Native Speaker, but
 
by Hupa definition, she is a Native Speaker. While Elsie Ricklefs only lists
 
10 to 15 people as Native Speakers, Adrian Drake consulted her mother Lila
 
Colegrove, an acknowledged Native Speaker, and compiled a list of 79 "Hupa
 
Speaking People 1982".  (List appended here) A future study should interview
 
Elsie and Adrian in order to determine their criteria for defining Native
 
Speakers. The current study has chosen the low figure of 10 to 15 Native
 
Speakers as I have heard other Elders use approximately the same number.

HUPA INDIAN LANGUAGE SCHOOLS,  1982
 
1
.0  INTRODUCTION
  
In northwest California's Humboldt County, the lower course of the Trinity
 
River flows northerly through Hoopa Valley. The principal twelve mile square
 
section of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation (1) is characterized by hills and
 
canyons surrounding a valley created by the Trinity River, designated a "Wild River"
 
by the state of California (2).  The valley is isolated by mountain ranges on the east
 
and west, and by river gorges on the north and south.
 
The Reservation is rich in natural resources. Animals that are still hunted
 
for food and fur include deer,  squirrel, black bear,  fox, raccoon, rabbit and
 
puma. The renowned fish resources of northwest California's wild rivers include
 
salmon, trout, sturgeon, suckers and eel. The main plants utilized as foods by  - 
the Indian people are several varieties of acorn producing oaks, pine nuts, lily
 
bulbs, other nuts and many berries. In their non-subsistence technology,  the Indian
 
people utilize animal by-products,  such as skins, antlers,  feathers, bone and
 
shell, as well as plant material in woodworking and basketry.  (Beals & Hester 1974)
 
The Hupa (
3) are Athapaskan speaking Indians who continue to occupy a major
 
portion of their pre-contact territory, which was set aside as a reservation in
 
1864, only a generation or two after white contact. This geographical and cultural
 
continuity and relative lack of disruption (compared to other California Indian
 
groups) are major factors in the modern situation where continuous language and
 
cultural traditions exist as part of the present Native American way of life at Hoopa.
 
The 1980 U.S. Census declared that more American Indian people live in
 
California than in any other state. And California's largest Indian Reservation,
 
both in terms of territory and population, is the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation.
 
My sincere thanks for critical readings of this manuscript to Elsie Ricklefs (Tribal
 
Chairman), Victor Golla (Geo. Washington University), Byron Nelson Jr.  (Tribal
 
Historian),  William Bright (UCLA), and Adrienne Drake (Director of the Tribal
 
Career Center).

Living on this reservation are approximately 1000 Hupa Tribal members, 800 other
 
Indian people, and 2200 non-Indians, for a total of 4,000 inhabitants of Hoopa
 
Valley. The Hoopa Valley Business Council, a Tribal Council for the Hupa people,
 
maintains a Hupa Tribal Roll listing 1640 Tribal members,
 
640 Hupa people live off the reservation (
4).
 
The educational system at Hoopa began with a reservation school in the 1870's
 
and an Indian Boarding School in 1893. The Hoopa Boarding School became a day
 
s
chool in 1932. Presently the Hoopa High School and the Hoopa Elementary School,
 
both public schools in the Klamath-Trinity School District of Humboldt County,
 
s
erve the needs of the Valley residents.
 
It i
s important to note the early philosophy of the educational systems at
 
Hoopa concerning the education of Indian people. About 1880, the military agent
,
 
at Fort Gaston in command of the Reservation, devoted his attention to the
 
'
assimilation' of the Hupa. "If persuasion would not induce the Indians to change,
 
the agents were told to withhold rations, and if necessary, use other means to
 
reach the desired end" (Nelson 1978:117). The Boarding School emphasized '
practical'
 
skills, and instruction in manual (or menial) labor made up 50% of the curriculum
 
(
farming, laundry, cooking, sewing) (
5).
 
The learning of English was to be the equalizing mechanism in the ideal of
 
America the melting pot. Some of the Elders today recall the punishments for
 
speaking the Indian language at the Boarding School.
 
indicating
 
that
 
We used to get punished for talking Indian at school. I know many times I
 
couldn't come home because I got caught talking Indian. My dad used to
 
bring the horse. He'd come by horseback. He'd come up there, and I
'd tell
 
him, "I can't go home."  "What's the matter?"
 I said, "I talked Indian."
 
"Oh, pshaw!"
 Everything would be '
Oh, pshaw' with him. (Alice laughs)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70 (

The memory of the educational system's harsh attitude to the Hupa language i
s
 
alive today in anyone who attended the Boarding S
chool, that i
s, anyone over
 
60 today who was born before approximately 1925. Many if not most of the Elders
 
l
earned the harsh lesson well, and wouldn't teach the language to their children,
 
Davis -
-

in order to spare the children from criticism and punishment.
 
When I was growing up, my parents' attitude was not to give us anything from
 
our culture. They were punished at the time. They couldn't talk their
 
language to their people. My grandmother raised me.  She said that when she
 
went to school, they were punished for talking their language. They had to
 
learn English, and they learned it real fast.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
The transmission of Hupa language skills in the home was so throttled by the
 
physical and social sanctions against native language and culture, that the
 
renewal of language skills within the Tribe had effectively come to a standstill
 
in 1970 when the first formal language classes were initiated. Today there
 
are 10 to 15 'Native Speakers' of Hupa, all of whom are over 60 years old (
7).
 
However since 1970,  the social movement to increase language awareness and
 
skills in a more general atmosphere of an '
Indian Renaissance' has sowed the seeds
 
of a hopeful future for the preservation and teaching of the Hupa language.  It was
 
during that time that Tom Parsons began recording the Hupa, Karok, Yurok and Tolowa
 
Indian languages of northwest California. All the language programs that were
 
developed later, had their roots in Tom Parsons early efforts.  (See language

In the school year of 1981-82, there were five language programs active on
 
the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, and a sixth related program at Humboldt State
 
University in Arcata, California, a one and a half hour drive from Hoopa to the
 
Pacific coast. In order of the age groups served by each program,  from youngest
 
to oldest, these are the six Hupa Indian language programs.  It should be noted
 
that these are also the only,
 classes for the Hupa language that exist anywhere.

There i
s a gap between the programs f
or elementary age children and adults,
 
as there i
s currently no Hupa language program available in the Hoopa High School.
 
There was a program in the High School taught by Elmer Jarnaghan, a Native Speaker,
 
until his death in 1980, and carried on until 1981 by his daughter, Marge Colegrove.
 
However there is not now a High School language program, and there are no plans f
or
 
one in the future. Presumably these students could attend the Career Center language
 
classes which are held at night, but in fact, there are no High School s
tudents
 
in that class.
 
This report will describe in detail the language program #2 at the Day
 
Care Center. First, there will be an overview of the other five language programs,
 
presented in order by age of students, from youngest to oldest, as in the previous list.
 
2
.1 Hoopa Valley Pre-School
  
The Hoopa Valley Pre-School is located in its own building across from the
 
Bureau of Indian Affairs office on the area of the Reservation called 'The Campus'
 
(
9). The language program was introduced into this school approximately two to
 
three years ago, when the Center for Community Development (hereafter referred to
 
as CCD) (
10) and Alice Pratt -
 a Native Speaker, Elder, and Tribal Medicine Woman -  
began to develop a language program for small children.
 
This school runs on a nine month school year calendar, with a half day
 
session in the morning and another half day session in the afternoon. The morning
 
s
ession was the only one with a language class. Alice Pratt would come in at
 
approximately 9
:30 or 10 AN and teach the children who were gathered into one
 
group for twenty minutes twice a week, on Wednesday and Thursday, after which she
 
was driven to the Day Care Center for its language program. The children at the
 
Pre-School range in age from two years nine months to five years. About forty
 
Pre-School children in the 1981-82 s
chool year participated in the language program
 
at some time. An average class consisted of fifteen children, although at times
 
there were thirty children in the class. The language class was held in the
 
Pre-School's '
Language Room' which displays the English alphabet and numbers,
 
Davis -

and houses the library.
 
The instructional plan that Alice used in each class consisted of teaching
 
the children to count one to ten and naming the body parts in Indian, and f
inishing
 
each class with the students singing "The Bear Went Over the Mountain" in the
 
Hupa language.
 
About once a month, Dr. Ruth Bennett of the CCD would accompany Alice to the
 
class, bringing animal puppets for the children to play with after the regular
 
language class. The children learned the animal names in Hupa and took on the
 
character of the animals in play acting.
 
On special occasions another Elder who spoke the language would come in and
 
make a presentation to the children. Rudolf Socktish, the Hupa spiritual leader,
 
sang and played the traditional drum in the class once.
 
The children have been enthusiastic about the language classes, although
 
their attention span has been strained over the year. The parents feel very good
 
about the '
idea' of their children learning Indian language, although for the
 
most part the parents haven't involved themselves in the classes per se. One
 
child's parents indicated that their child not be included in the language class.
 
They felt that this form of teaching Indian language was belittling, and that
 
if the child were to learn the language, it should be done at home. In general,
 
however, there was a very positive attitude among the parents toward this class.
 
The teachers at the Pre-School all supported the idea of the children learning
 
Indian language, and all but one participated in the program, by gathering the
 
children together when Alice arrived, and by encouraging  the children in their
 
language efforts at other times. Several of the teachers felt that there should be
 
improvements in the teaching methodology for pre-school age children. The program
 
as it exists was developed several years ago and the teachers would
 like to
 
contribute their expertise in early childhood development to the language skills
 
of Alice Pratt and the language teaching experience of CCD. Some of the teachers'
 
Davis -
-
 6
 
ideas include working the language curriculum into a pre-school format by
 
integrating the auditory skills now required, with visual aids and movement.  The
 
present program prepares the children for the elementary school program by giving
 
them a familiarity with the sounds of the language and by providing them with a
 
basic vocabulary.

other five programs.

.3 HOOPA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
  
For approximately ten years, until the end of this 1981-82 school year when this
 
program was discontinued,  there has been a Hupa language program run by the Klamath-
Trinity School District,  in the Hoopa Valley Elementary School. Eleanor Abbott has
 
been the teacher, paid by the School District.
 
She has a special teaching credential, called the Eminent Domain Credential
 
(
EDC). The state of California has a provision for this credential in order to
 
certify an individual who has informally acquired the expertise to teach a
 
subject specifically called for in a community, for which there is no university
 
degree program available for formal training in that area. Elmer Jarnaghan was
 
the first native language speaker in the Hoopa area to receive the EDC. He taught
 
in the High School until his death in 1980. Eleanor Abbott had worked in the
 
CCD for Tom Parsons and learned the Unifon alphabet used there to record the md
 
languages of northwest California. Tom Parsons encouraged the School Board to
 
consider Eleanor for the EDC, and together Tom and the Klamath-Trinity District
 
petitioned the state for her credential. Although Eleanor was not a Native
 
Speaker,  the credential was awarded with the understanding that she would improve
 
her language proficiency. While Elmer was teaching in the High School, Eleanor
 
taught Indian language in the Elementary School.
 
Davis -

Because of the nature of this special credential, the only public school
 
classes which Eleanor was qualified to teach were the Indian language classes and
 
cultural enrichment programs. There are two other Indian Cultural Specialists in
 
the Elementary School, Anthony Risling and Cathy Colegrove, who carry out a variety
 
of cultural enrichment programs, but do not teach the Hupa language. Eleanor's
 
c
lasses were elective for the students in kindergarten through third grade,
 
required parental permission, and were held during the regular class hours. The
 
students who signed up for these c
lasses left their regular classrooms and went
 
to Eleanor's room for the language class. She used curriculum materials developed
 
by CCD using the Unif
 on alphabet. For the last two to three years, many students
 
in her classes have come into this program with language skills learned from Alice
 
Pratt in the Pre-School and Day Care language programs. With f
lash cards and
 
drill, Eleanor reinforced the pre-school age skills through repetition. There
 
has been no communication between Alice Pratt and Eleanor Abbott concerning the
 
skills taught to the pre-school age groups so that Eleanor would have a basis
 
for follow-up programs. The emphasis of her class was on vocabulary development
 
and cultural enrichment.
 
There has been no problem securing parental permission required for children
 
to enroll in this class. The children have been enthusiastic about the idea of
 
learning Indian language. However, the classes have only been filled for half of
 
the class periods of the day, and about half of the 150 students that started the
 
program dropped out by the end of the school year. Some reasons f
or this have
 
been lack of communication and encouragement between the regular classrooms, the
 
home and the language class. When a student leaves the regular classroom in these
 
early grades, it is often treated as a disruption. And if the student decides to
 
stop going to language c
lass, the parents do not often put pressure on the child
 
to stay in the class.
 
It was amidst controversy that the School Board voted to discontinue this
 
Davis -
-
 8
 
c
lass at the end of the 1981-82 s
chool year. The School Board hopes that
 
Humboldt State University's CCD will expand Marge Colegrove's program (
language
 
program #4 in this report in this paper, p
.
 9
) and pick up its cost, thereby
 
adressing the language needs of the community through the efforts and resources
 
of the college. There have been disagreements between Eleanor Abbott, Marge
 
Colegrove and Ruth Bennett of CCD, which are recorded in the School Board minutes.
 
After her class was cancelled Eleanor chose to retire. However the School Board
 
has not approved an EDC for Marge Colegrove. They may be waiting for HSU to
 
graduate credentialed teachers from its new Bilingual Credential Program, as these
 
people would be qualified to teach classes in the standard curriculum as well as
 
Indian language classes.
 
According to the School Board's philosophy, it i
s important to mainstream  - 
Indian language and culture into the regular classes, rather than separating them
 
out for half hour classes as they are now. The students would have more opportunity
 
all day long to have this learning reinforced, if all the teachers were trained
 
to learn the basics of Indian language and culture and could then integrate these
 
subjects into the standard curriculum. At this point there is no reinforcement
 
of language outside of the half hour class, as Indian language i
s a departmentalized
 
program. Because of this philosophy, the School Board is hesitant to maintain
 
a separate Indian language classroom and curriculum. The School Board which has
 
a responsibility to the whole community is sensitive as well to the other Indian
 
groups represented in the Hoopa schools, especially the Yurok and Karok people
 
who attend the schools in substantial numbers, and whose languages have never
 
been taught there. This northwest pocket of California presents an interesting
 
cultural anomaly in the anthropology of native North America, for the three
 
tribes living here derive from Athapaskan (Hupa tribe), Hokan (Karok tribe) and
 
Algonquian (Yurok tribes) linguistic groups, yet they shared essentially the
 
same culture and religious beliefs and behaviors. To teach all three languages
 
on the Reservation has been a greater burden than the School District has been
 
Davis -
-
 9
 
willing or able to bear.
 
There has been concern on the part of n
iarly educators about the curriculum
 
itself. The feeling is that the rote vocabulary activities should be supplemented
 
with audio-visual, i
nultiserisoral materials, and a variety of techniques that are
 
geared to the age levels of the students.
 
At this point, there seems to be a breakdown in communication between the
 
philosophical and professional concerns of the School Board, and the pressing
 
need of the Indian community to gain the School Board's cooperation in preserving
 
and passing on what may otherwise by a dying language heritage.

.4 HOOPA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EXTRA-CURRICULAR PROGRAM
  
There were two Indian language classes run simultaneously at the Hoops Valley
 
Elementary School in the 1981-82 school year. The Eleanor Abbott program was run
 
and paid for by the Klamath-Trinity School District. The other program was elective,
 
run and paid for by CCD, and taught by Marge Colegrove with the a
ssistance of
 
Marion Mooney.
 
Marge Colegrove i
s the daughter of the late Elmer Jarnaghan, a Native Speaker
 
of Hupa, who was the first. credentialed (EDC) teacher of Indian language in Hoops
 
Valley. Beginning in 1972 for two years, Marge attended Elmer's language class
 
offered in Hoopa Valley through the auspices of the College of the Redwoods (
the
 
Junior College in Eureka). In 1974 Elmer asked her to assist him in the High
 
School language classes, so the K-T School District employed her. In 1978, she
 
effectively took over Elmer's classes, although he remained active as her consultant.
 
Elmer passed away in 1980. In 1981 she resigned from the High School, and
 
although there was some effort to keep a High School program going with Eleanor
 
Abbott, the school felt that the enrollment was too low to continue the classes.
 
Therefore since 1981 there have been no Indian language programs at all for High
 
School students, and there are no plans for any future High School programs.
 
Marge has tried twice to convince the K-T School Board to petition the state
 
for an EDC on her behalf, but to no avail. When Elmer passed away, the Board felt
 
Davis -
-
 10
 
that they already had a credentialed teacher in Eleanor Abbott to take his place,
 
so they wouldn't credential Marge. There has been community support for credentialing
 
Marge. Tom Parsons of the CCD has appeared before the Board twice on her behalf,
 
and the High School students presented a petition to the school to reinstate Marge.
 
The School Board has asked for Marge's class to give a language performance
 
to prove to them the quality of the program. This irritates Marge who feels singled
 
out from the other teachers and classes who have never been asked to give a
 
performance of skills. The school's philosophy is now against programs which ta
 
students away from their regular classes, so there have been problems with
 
scheduling Marge's classes, and suggestions that she offer her classes before
 
and after school and during lunch period, which she feels is unfair to her and the
 
s
tudents. There has also been the suggestion, based on the philosophy against
 
pull-out programs, that Marge sit in a section of an ongoing class and teach a few
 
of the students, which she feels would be distracting to the regular class as
 
well as to the learning of this very difficult Indian language.
 
Marge has become frustrated and disillusioned with the school system after
 
teaching there for eight years without the acknowledgement of a credential.
 
What makes her return each fall, she says, are the kids who show the willpower
 
to overcome s
chool resistance to this class, and who are determined to learn the
 
Indian language. However she feels that the language will not die, as about 200
 
students have now been in the classes and have their notes. Her four children
 
are l
earning the language from her, and will certainly carry it on.
 
In 1981-82 Marge's classes were held in the Reading Lab of the Elementary School,
 
a facility shared with the Johnson O
'Malley Program. There were two sessions, five
 
days a week -
 a class before school hours from 8
:15 to 9 A
11, and a class during
 
the school day in the 5th elective period from 1
:15 to 2 PM. Eighteen students were
 
enrolled in this program, eight 8th graders, eight students in a combined 4th/5th
 
grade class, and two 6th graders. For a while there were five 7th graders who
 
stopped coming because they shared the class with the 8th graders and this created
 
—I!
 
too much tension.  The students in these classes have generally been enrolled in
 
earlier language classes,  although no students have yet reached the 4th grade
 
level with the previous experience of the pre-school age language programs, as
 
these have only been in existence for a few years.
 
Next year, without the Eleanor Abbott classes for the kindergarten through
 
3rd graders, Marge will be responsible for more grade levels in the Elementary
 
School. At that time the school will provide the space and non-curriculum materials
 
for the class, and CCD will provide the salaries for Marge and Marion and the
 
curriculum materials for the classes.  CCD uses this class as a lab setting to
 
develop curriculum materials for the HSU Bilingual Credential Program. Marion
 
Mooney who holds a Standard California Teaching Credential, acts as the curriculum
 
specialist in the class.  She helps Marge take the concepts and skills she wants -to
 
teach,  and develop*4ays to introduce them in the curriculum,  for instance in a
 
game format.
 
Marion Mooney is not a Native Speaker, although she is learning the language.
 
Marge is also not a Native Speaker, although she has been studying the language for
 
ten years and is probably the best Hupa speaker of her age (36 years old).  She
 
grew up in a family where her father, Elmer Jarnaghan, was a Native Speaker, and her
 
mother understood and spoke some Hupa. Marge is now teaching her four children the
 
language so that Hupa is spoken in her home. Her mother in law, Lila Colegrove,
 
is a Native Speaker, and her husband is a leader in the Brush Dance ceremonies. The
 
language and the culture are constantly reinforced in her personal and professional life.
 
This is not true for most Hupa families, where there are no language skills,
 
so the children who learn words and phrases at school are not reinforced in Indian
 
language at home. The  religious ceremonies are the primary situations where any
 
Hupa person can hear the language spoken correctly and abundantly,  in its proper
 
context, as the Elders come to the ceremonies and use the opportunity to speak to
 
each other in Indian, and the ceremonies themselves are conducted in the Indian
 
language. The interest level at Hoopa in the language is very high now, among all
 
T'Z, —
.• -
:
 
ages. What is learned in the classroom by the young people is being picked up in
 
the home as an inspiration to the parents to either take a language class themselves,
 
or to use their family's Elders as resource people who can teach them Hupa.  Some
 
of the Elders who did not speak Indian to their own children, are now encouraged to
 
speak the language to their grandchildren or great - grandchildren as they enthusiast-
ically acquire language skills.  This cross - generational feedback provides an
 
opportunity for the children to apply their new skills, creates a language
 
learning environment in the home,  and encourages and reinforces the children in
 
learning more about their language and culture.

.5 HOOPA VALLEY BUSINESS COUNCIL, ADULT CAREER EDUCATION CENTER (CAREER CENTER)  
The Indian language class that serves the adult community at Hoopa is
 
administered by the Hoopa Valley Business Council's (11) Adult Career Education
 
Center, commonly referred to as either the Hupa Tribal Career Center, or simply
 
as the Career Center, which is located behind the Neighborhood Facility. For the
 
forty weeks of the school year,  a class is held once a week from 7 to 10 PM.  The
 
language program was introduced into the Career Center's schedule in 1980.  The
 
Career Center's program of adult education and basic skills began in 1979.
 
Adrienne Drake is the Director of the Career Center.  She had previously worked
 
for CCD as a Vocational Counselor in 1
973 ' and in 1
974 f
or Tri -County (The Indian
 
Manpower program for Humboldt, Del Norte and Siskyiou Counties).  She is not a
 
Native Speaker, although her mother, Lila Colegrove,  is.  She understands Hupa if
 
the Elders speak to her slowly.  (Consequently they speak rapidly when they don't
 
want her to understand.) Adrienne is one of the two Brush Dance Medicine Women
 
in the Tribe (12).
 
In 1981,  the Career Center contracted Dr. Victor Golla of George Washington
 
University in Washington, D.C., who had written Hupa Grammar (1970) as his
 
PhD dissertation at the University of California at Berkeley in the Department
 
of Linguistics.  He is the only living author on the language. He has been very
 
willing to work with the Tribe,  and spends his s
iu mers at Hoopa.  In 1981,  the Tribe
 
Davis -
-
 13
 
contracted him to complete a Hupa Language Dictior3r - . wh
-
core of the language classes at the Career Center.
 
The Career Center language class serves two functions -
-
 the Elders work on
 
the Dictionary, and comm unity members observe and participate in this process,
 
thereby learning the language. This class is very different from the other Hupa
 
language classes, in that there is no  '
teacher' and no lesson plan. At the
 
beginning of each session,  either Adrienne or another class member chooses a section
 
of the Dictionary, and Adrienne reads that section one word at a time. The Elders
 
then say the word in Hupa several times, so the class can practice the sounds which
 
don't exist in English, and the specific pronunciation of the word. Often discussion
 
will result about a word, what it means, another Hupa word that they had used for
 
this item, the context of its use, a controversy between the Elders over one of
 
these issues,  sometimes a song, a story or formula, and sometimes a complete
 
digression.
 
This manner of conducting the class is flexible, low key and non-threatening
 
to people many of whom aren't used to or comfortable in a standard classroom
 
situation. In some ways,  it is similar to the manner of interacting in an
 
informal gathering in an Indian home. There is much humor and laughter. The pace
 
is determined imperceptibly by the mood of the class as a whole.  Sometimes the
 
class lasts 45 minutes,  sometimes three hours or more. People will often stay after
 
class to socialize and discuss language and culture anecdotally (e.g. An Elder
 
in a family told a student something that the student wanted to check out with
 
another Elder in class. A student heard something at a ceremony. What did it mean?).
 
Coffee is available during class, and at some point is served respectfully to the Elders.
 
There has been a maximum of about 33 students in a class, although the average
 
is closer to 15 students.  In the spring of 1982 (
13), the Elders participating
 
in the class were Lila Colegrove, Myrtle Moon and Pearl Randall, all Native
 
Speakers.  In the past, other Native Speakers who have been involved in the class
 
included Rudolf Socktish, Alice Pratt, Clarissa Stone, Jimmy Jackson, and Evelyn

Marshall. According to Adrienne, there are approximately 79 Native Speakers of
 
s
ome proficiency in Hupa. According to Elsie Ricklefs, the Tribal Chairman, Elder
 
and Native Speaker, there are only ten to fifteen Native Speakers, all over the
 
age of 60 years old. This difference of opinion probably reflects a different
 
definition of language proficiency, as Adrienne's list includes people that Elsie
 
has explicitly excluded (
7). Adrienne's list is appended to this report.It i

The three Elders now participating in the class are paid by the
 
Center from the BIA's Adult Education Program funds. No one else in the class
 
i
s paid. One student this spring, Tammy Hostler, was receiving college credit
 
from HSU's Bilingual Program in which she is a student.
 
In 1980 CCD asked the Career Center to use the language class as a lab to
 
develop language curriculum and concepts. In turn CCD paid some Elders to
 
participate in the class and offered college credits for class participation. This
 
association ended in 1981 amidst controversy, and there has been no further
 
a
ssociation with CCD.
 
The Career Center's class is unique among the six Hupa language classes,
 
in that it i
s the only one not affiliated with CCD and the only one that doesn't
 
use the Unifon alphabet. When Victor Golla presented the idea of the Dictionary
 
to the Tribe, together they decided to use the Modified International Phonetic
 
Alphabet, which the Career Center now uses. This has caused some confusion, which
 
could be aggravated if there was ever a coordination of effort among the various
 
language efforts and their two alphabet systems. The Elders were not comfortable
 
with the Unifon alphabet and supported Victor in his decision to abandon it in
 
favor of the more familiar looking Modified International Phonetic Alphabet.
 
However at this point, the only person who can listen to Hupa and record it in
 
the MIPA i
s Victor. There are several people who can record the language in Unifon:
 
Davis -

 15
 
Ruth Bennett, Marge Colegrove, probably Eleanor Abbott, and the HSU Bilingual
 
Program students.
 
This summer of 1982 when Dr. Golla arrives, there will be workshops run in
 
the manner described above, but on an irregular schedule. The weekly classes
 
will resume in the fall.
 
The Tribal Council supports language efforts in theory but has allocated little
 
money to any of the language programs. It has contracted Dr. Golla to complete the
 
Dictionary and has established a fund for secretarial and publishing costs.
 
These allocations by the Tribal Council have indicated their goodwill and support
 
for the language program. The Tribe has been involved in litigation for years,
 
trying to save the Valley's resources for the people. Therefore even though
 
education i
s stated to be a high priority, it i
s a low priority in terms of funding.
 
And within the area of education, the Career Center has given priority to getting
 
High School diplomas for its students. There are many
 
power at Hoopa, Tribal Council members and members of
 
Committee, who believe that the language is dying and
 
people in positions of
 
the Tribe's Education
 
should not be supported
 
since Indian language skills won't get anyone into college, get a job, or help
 
support a family. This attitude finds employable skills worthwhile, and views
 
language classes as an extra and somewhat frivolous activity with low funding
 
priority in an era of dwindling budgetary resources.
 
In general, Tribal members believe that the language i
s important, whether
 
they participate or not. However most families don't follow up on a child's
 
interest in learning Hupa by speaking and encouraging the Indian language in
 
the home. Nor do they encourage the child to be around Hupa speaking people, nor
 
come into the classrooms and learn the language with the child.
 
Adrienne Drake is an enthusiastic supporter of recording and preserving the
 
Hupa language. In her view, it i
s of prime importance to define and encourage the
 
unique nature of this group of people. The alternative is integration and assimilation
 
into white society, with the loss of a unique self-esteem. Hupa people often have
 
-
 
t
rouble with the English language because of the background of the Hupa language,
 
whether or not they speak i
t. They are made to feel inferior when they speak
 
and write broken English, and this engenders a low self-concept. Politically, the
 
Indians of the Valley have been battling to conserve their natural resources
 
(
such as the Trinity River water which is threatened by the Peripheral Canal
 
water Diversion issue, and the salmon whose numbers dwindle every year) in order
 
to sustain the Hupa religion and its ceremonial life, as well as to contribute to
 
the subsistence economy of the Valley people. The religion is intimately tied
 
into the language, as the ceremonies are conducted in Hupa, and the spirits speak
 
to the Medicine Women, Alice Pratt and Adrienne Drake, in Hupa. For these
 
educational, psychological, political and religious reasons, Adrienne has
 
continued her efforts to preserve and pass on the Hupa language.

it as a laboratory situation. CCD supports five of the six Hupa language programs
 
with funds or curriculum. It pays the salary of the language teachers in the
 
Pre-School, Day Care and Elementary School Extra-Curricular Programs. It
 
administers the HSU Bilingual Program and has provided curriculum materials for
 
all of these programs as well as the Eleanor Abbott program in the Elementary
 
School. CCD has developed curriculum materials and supported teachers and language
 
students in preparing curriculum materials. It puts on workshops periodically
 
for teachers in Hoopa, centered on curriculum and not on theory.
 
Although no credentialed teachers have yet graduated from the HSU program
 
to come back to the Hoopa community, former Day Care and Pre-School teachers have
 
left their jobs to enter this program as s
tudents. Ruth has also played a key
 
personal role in recording and preserving the Hupa language, in encouraging Elders
 
to participate in all the language programs, and in actively encouraging the
 
Klamath-Trinity School Board, the Tribal Council and its various departments to
 
recognize the important role that the native language could and should play in
 
Hupa society.

.0 HUPA N+-JE-E-D4IN DAY CARE CENTER -
-
 AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF ITS LANGUAGE CLASS
  
The Day Care Center is a department of the Hoopa Valley Business Council,
 
commonly called the Hupa Tribal Council. The Center is located in the Neighborhood
 
Facility and is an all day program serving children from two to seven years old.
 
This is the only onWof the six programs that runs continuously throughout the
 
year, that is, the only language program with summer classes. Alice Pratt teaches
 
Indian language twice a week at the Day Care Center, Wednesday and Thursday from
 
11 to 12 L
AN. She is driven there in the Headstart van from the Pre-School where
 
she teaches just before this time on the same days.
 
Upon arriving, Alice goes to the kitchen area where Charlotte Colegrove, the
 
cook and also a Hupa speaker, has a cup of coffee for her. They chat and then
 
Alice enters the classroom with her coffee. The class is held in the room where
 
lunch i
s later served, and it is closed off for the class. The students are
 
brought in by the teachers, in groups of three to six. Each class lasts from ten
 
to twenty minutes, and the next group of children i
s then brought in. One to
 
four classes are held per hour, depending on how many students are in school that
 
day. Alice may be the only adult in the room, however one of the Day Care teachers
 
usually observes, Sherry Nixon or Laura Latham, who tell the children that if
 
t
hey are good, they will get a sticker. On Thursdays, Ruth Bennett will often
 
accompany and assist Alice Pratt, and bring specially made, high-quality puppets
 
of the animals from Indian legends.
 
Alice follows a standard teaching procedure. She chats with the children as
 
they enter. She is sitting at a table shaped like a kidney bean, in the convex
 
section. The children sit in chairs arranged on the convex outside of the table
-
facing Alice. Alice generally starts the class by counting one to ten, first
 
saying the number in English, then in Indian, while pointing to her fingers. As
 
the children are quite proficient in this exercise, Alice will often have them
 
repeat the counting if their attention wanders or they misbehave. Counting is
 
a familiar guidepost to which Alice returns the children in order to focus their
 
attention back to the lesson. She then enumerates the body parts, first in English,
 
then in Hupa, while pointing to the part of the body with her hand: feet, eyes,
 
nose, mouth, ears, tongue, hand, fingernails, elbow, arm, leg, knee, toenails,
 
shoulder, back, ribs, stomach, hair, eyelashes, backbone, neck, jawbone, head,
 
false teeth, teeth, cheeks, calf, eyebrows, forehead, liver, navel.
 
Interspersed in this routine, Alice interacts with the children in Indian,
 
with such phrases as: I told you, don't bother that, sit down, don't do that,
 
I
'm leaving, I
'll see you again, I am talking, wait aminute, do you understand,
 
what is it, what are you saying, what are you doing, I
'm glad to see you, how
 
are you, shut your mouth, you go no ears (
scolding to child), I
'll do that today,
 
don't say that, you're scared, it stinks, you crazy Indian you.
 
She also will include stories about life when she was a child, about what
 
Davis -
-
 19
 
it was like to live an '
Indian'  life in the old days: the difficulty of gathering
 
acorns and finding deer to kill and the patience it took to fish, how her father
 
caught a sturgeon in his net, how the old Indian people reprimanded children for
 
interrupting, how the children were punished for speaking Indian in Boarding
 
School, how strict the Boarding School was.
 
The class has come to an end when Alice or the Day Care teacher who is
 
observing,  indicates that the children should sing "The Bear Went Over The
 
Mountain" which they boom out in Indian with great delight. The teachers often
 
give the children stickers at this point as rewards for being good in class.
 
If Ruth Bennett has brought the puppets,  she will then hand them out and
 
encourage the children in play acting with the animals, using their Hupa
 
names if possible: bear, eagle, red headed woodpecker, etc. The following is a
 
scenario from one of the puppet playing sessions.

she laughs)

Well.. .

OK. Everybody can come in.  Sit down. OK, we'll go to your house. OK.
 
We're going to our house.

During the class itself, Ruth may lead the children in the correct HuTE
 
response to Alice's questioning in English, as well as disciplining the childre
 
in the proper respect for Alice: pay attention, show respect, don't be silly,
 
don't bother things -- both in English and in Indian.
 
Alice Pratt is one of a dozen Native language speakers in Hoopa. She i
s a
 
respected Elder and a Medicine Woman in religious ceremonies. Her family came
 
from an area in Hoopa Valley that is just below her present house. Her parents
 
spoke Hupa in the home, and she didn't learn English until she went to the
 
Boarding School in Hoopa. She often tells the story of being punished for talki
 
Indian at Boarding School.
 
Years ago we used to get punished for talking Indian. Oh, we went to
 
Boarding School. And then Friday comes, well, you can go home. Come back
 
Sunday. And then if you're caught talking Indian language, you can't go
 
home. Um-hm. And that's what they done to us. We had one little spot that
 
we used to go sit in. In that little building they had, there was a
 
basement down there. And they cut that off, they closed it. But we could
 
still sit up there. So we used to go up there, and talk to one another.
 
(
she laughs)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70
 
The lesson that Alice and the other people in her generation learned was that
 
it was unacceptable to speak Indian, that to move forward into the modern world
 
they would have to leave behind their Indian culture. They did not speak Indian
 
to their children, except for words and phrases, and their children grew up
 
speaking English, understanding some Hupa when their parents still spoke i
t to
 
each other, with their own small vocabulary of Indian words and phrases.
 
However, the old people .
..
 
clung to the language tenaciously, those who did
 
speak it. They thought that it was very important. And in any matter of r
eal
 
importance, that was the language they'd use, because they could express
 
themselves better, people could understand better, because it was much
 
Davis -

deeper than some of the translations that we had. People on the outside
 
would take verbatim reports. When it came out translated, it was not really
 
accurate, and did not reflect the true feeling and meaning of what the
 
Indian people were trying to say.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
Alice stopped speaking Indian to her own children. She thought it was no good.
 
Her son Alex and her daughter Jean don't speak Hupa, but her son Edgar knows
 
some Indian. However with the resurgence of interest in their heritage among the
 
Hupa people, Alice has begun to teach the language to her great-grandchildren
 
whom she looks after, and they are good learners.
 
With the increasing recognition being given to the Native Speaking Elders by
 
Hupa society, younger people in Alice's family have come to her as a resource
 
person in learning the language. Laura Latham, her step-granddaughter, was a
 
student years ago in the Elmer Jarnaghan class at Hoopa High School. After she
 
graduated from High School, she began losing her skills due to lack of opportunity
 
for application. She went to Alice and tape recorded her speaking Hupa. Laura now
 
works at the Day Care Center where she assists and observes in the language classes.
 
Her son, T
.R., is one of the Day Care students. Before she worked in the Day Care,
 
T
.R. came home with Indian words, and this made her proud. She has made the
 
effort to improve her own language skills, by listening to the tapes that Alice
 
made for her, by using Hupa in the home and by encourageing T
.R. to speak
 
Hupa as well  Laura is proud to be an Indian, and to participate in Indian culture.
 
She is proud that in her generation, she has the opportunity to learn and speak
 
the language after it's been gone so long.
 
It was about three years ago when Ruth Bennett of CCD came after Alice to
 
ask her to teach Indian language to little children. This was the first time
 
that Alice had actually taught the language. Until that time, she spoke Indian
 
to other older people, with minimal cross-generational language transmission.
 
The interest in passing on the language, the seeking out of younger people, and
 
the development of a new set of roles in the language context, adding those of
 
teacher-student to the old role set of Elder Native Speaker-Elder Native Speaker,
 
Davis -

are major social developments that have accompanied the actual cultural increase
 
in language skills.

.0 COOPERATION OF FIVE AGENCIES IN DAY CARE LANGUAGE PROGRAM
 
The language class at the Day Care Center which enjoys great community
 
approval and prestige, due in large part to the reputation, language skills and
 
personality of Alice Pratt, has been unusually successful in sustaining a
 
widespread cooperative effort among various agencies within the Hupa Tribe, as
 
well as with outside agencies at the University. The contribution of each agency
 
to this cooperative effort in the Day Care language class,  is described below.
 
4.1 DAY CARE CENTER
 
Marsha Feinland was the Director of the Center until July 1
, 1982, when this
 
program was consolidated with the Johnson O
'Malley Program and Headstart under
 
the Directorship of Elizabeth Pratt Marshall. The language program was introduced
 
into the Center several years ago. The Center functions to facilitate the program
 
in terms of making time in the children's schedule for the language class, by
 
providing the van and the physical facility for the class. The staff, which is all
 
Indian exept for Marsha, accomodates cultural programs by giving them priority
 
over the regularly scheduled activities, and by changing their own schedules when
 
necessary. The staff thinks it's important for the children, who are almost all
 
Indian,  to learn about their cultural heritage.
 
4 2 JOHNSON O'MALLEY PROGRAM (JON)  
Leslie Campbell works with Elders in developing curriculum materials for the
 
Pre-School and Day Care Centers. This is a cultural enrichment program not
 
specifically tied into the language program, although clearly related. Leslie is
 
in the process of making up a Cultural Book,  in which learning exercises,  such as
 
connect the dots,  shape games, and identification of like items, are illustrated
 
with local plants, native basket designs, elki-i
orn spoons, recipes for Indian food,
 
and legends from local oral tradition,  instead of the  standard cultural inventory

from Anglo-American society. Leslie i
s a parent of children in the Day Care
 
program and i
s involved in its parent committee. CCD works with this program,
 
because of its interest in bicultural curriculum materials, but there is no formal
 
affiliation.

.3 HEADSTART
 
Elizabeth Marshall was Interim Director of the Headstart Program until
 
July 1
, 1982 when she became Interim Director of the Consolidated Program which
 
includes the Day Care Center, Headstart and the Pre-School. The Day Care Center
 
was set up f
rom its inception to include a cultural component, using reservation
 
people, especially the Elders. Elizabeth believes that the continuity of one teacher,
 
Alice Pratt, in the language program, has maintained the focus on the teaching
 
unit of Alice and the children, and that i
s a key to the success of this
 
language program. Support for the language program falls into Headstart's educational
 
component and its philosophy of cultural preservation through education. Headstart
 
has paid for the van and gas to pick up Alice.

.4 HSU CENTER FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (
CCD)
  
Ruth Bennett, Director of the Bilingual Credential Program at Humboldt S
tate
 
University, and Assistant to Tom Parsons at CCD, lives in Hoopa, and is a regular
 
visitor in the Day Care's language class. Ruth works with Alice on Thursday
 
afternoons, collecting language data, so she often accompanies Alice to language
 
classes on Thursday mornings. CCD pays Alice out of a Bilingual Grant to teach and
 
to consult with Ruth on
 
specially made based on
 
encourages the children
 
her language research. Ruth may bring in animal puppets,
 
the local Indian legends. After a language session, Ruth
 
to play act with the puppets, and to learn their Indian
 
names. The children enjoy this very much. Ruth is in the process of developing and
 
working with others to develop curriculum materials to teach language and culture
 
classes. She is also instrumental in arranging for workshops on language
 
curriculum to be held in the Valley, drawing on such resource people as Dr. Pat
 
Wenger of the Anthropology Department at HSU.

4 5 TRIBAL COUNCIL (HooPA VALLEY BUSINESS COUNCIL)
  
Elsie Ricklefs is the Chairman of the Hupa Tribal Goverment.  She is one of
 
the "Full Blood" (14) Hupa people in the Valley,  is a Native Speaker of the language,
 
and a highly respected Tribal Elder. She is very thoughtful and articulate about
 
the role of language in Hupa culture. The Tribal Council administers the Day
 
Care Center, however at a budgetary level, and does not involve itself in the
 
daily activities nor in the educational programs of the Center. The Council has
 
discussed the role of language in recording, preserving and passing on the Tribal
 
heritage. Philosophically it supports all language efforts.  In its budget,  there is
 
money to promote the language efforts of Dr. Golla in compiling the Hupa Dictionary.

.0 COINCIDENT ISSUES IN THE HUPA INDIAN LANGUAGE PROGRAMS
  
To conclude this report,  I would like to reiterate some of the key issues
 
involved in the Day Care language program and in the Hupa language efforts in
 
general, drawing especially on the perceptive comments of the many articulate
 
and concerned community members from taped interviews.
 
5
.1 REPUTATION OF THE DAY CARE LANGUAGE PROGRAM
 
This widely respected program is perhaps the least controversial of all six
 
Hupa language programs.  Its success rests to a certain extent on its continuing
 
focus on Alice and the children, rather than on political,  financial, or curriculum
 
issues.  In interviews with Day Care teachers, students and parents, in conversations
 
with community members, it is clear that the Day Care language program has earned
 
the highest regard and admiration.
 
Children
  
In interviews and informal conversations with Day Care students from two
 
through six years old, there were two major impressions. First, the children for
 
the most part either liked or were enthusiastic about Alice and the language class.
 
I like class.
 
Alice is pretty.
 
Alice, did you go to that Brush Dance (Alice is a Medicine Woman in this
 
ceremony)? I seen you. Were you making the Medicine? I seen you too. Me
 
too.  I was there too. Alice I was in the Brush Dance (a boy who is a
 
dancer),  I danced. Corky and Tsewenaldin, his little boy were in it (dancers
 
Second,  the children knew who in their families could speak Indian, which
 
indicates that Hupa is being spoken at home, and that the children have learned
 
who will interact with them in Hupa,  thereby reinforcing their own language skills,
 
and being a part of creating a home environment where there is pride in the
 
family's heritage. 
I
 
Day Care Teachers
  
The Teachers, who are all Indian,  support th,� ldnguag� prj2rdm,  ar,
 
in their own schedules to accomodate any language or cultural activity, and
 
encourage the children to use their language skills outside of class.
 
Sherry Nixon (Head Teacher) is real interested in the language.  She's
 
been in the language class  (at the Career Center)...Alice goes in the
 
Day Care class.  The teachers aides help get the kids together. At different
 
times there have been specific people appointed to get the kids together,
 
and get the kids in groups. And now Laura (Latham) gets the kids organized
 
and gets them together. We teach the class, and when that group is done,
 
they bring in another group. We get a lot of cooperation in terms of
 
having the class taught, and having it go in an effective way .
.. That's one
 
of the things, besides the fact that Alice is a good teacher,  that makes
 
this successful,  that the administrators are invisible. Alice and the
 
kids are the focus.
 
The teachers think the language class is a very important program. They've
 
been cooperative in accompanying the children to the lessons, and in
 
changing their schedules whenever necessary. Whatever lessons they had
 
planned, they held them in limbo, whatever they needed to do to accomodate
 
the language classes or any cultural programs. All the staff members here
 
are American Indian except for myself, and they all feel that it's very
 
important for the children to learn about their culture.
 
Marsha Feinland, Director Day Care Center
 
Some of the teachers in the past have been so enthusiastic about the value of
 
the language program, that they have quit their jobs to enroll in HSU's Bilingual
 
Credential Program.
 
Parents
  
The parents wholeheartedly support
, the idea of their children learning
 
the Indian language.
 
There was a survey done by Steve Carr, Education Director, of the attitudes
 
of Pre-School and Day Care parents to different programs (
Community Needs
 
Assessment Survey, Hupa Tribe). Language got the highest support among
 
13 different things that the parents were asked their opinion of. Language

was either first, second or third choice of all the parents. And it was
 
first choice of a lot of them. There's a lot of interest in the language.
 
Dr. Ruth Bennett, CCD
 
There are many instances where the child has come home from Pre-School or
 
Day Care saying Indian words. This stirs the pride of the parents in the child
 
and consequently in their own feeling of pride in their Indian heritage. The
 
parents then may be motivated to learn some of the language themselves.
 
Before I started working at Day Care, my son was going there. He came
 
home with Indian words.  It just made me proud that he was learning it.  It
 
made me feel really good.  So I got into it myself so that I could work
 
with him. We use a lot of the words at home, our everyday vocabulary, and
 
we try to learn more.  I feel that it's really important that we bring it back.
 
Laura Latham, age in 20's
 
When I was growing up, my parents'  attitude was not to give us anything of
 
our culture. .  .because they were punished at the time for talking their
 
language to their people.. .My father speaks the language, but he doesn't
 
talk to us (his children). But now my kids have the opportunity to take the
 
language in the Grammar School. They're learning and that's stimulating him
 
(her father) into talking more to us in our language. With our kids now in
 
Headstart and the pre-kindergarten services, they go home and they stimulate
 
their parents, and so they're able to keep it up. They get interested and
 
they enroll in our Adult Career Center in the language, in craft making,
 
canoe building, making acorn spoons, making baskets, even making the dresses
 
(used in religious ceremonies), everything, down to arrows.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
This cross-generational snowballing interest and pride in the heritage started
 
with an Elder who is a language teacher (Alice), moved to young children, which
 
encouraged the parents' and grandparents' participation and reinforcement
 
through the incorporation of the Indian language and culture in the home and family.
 
Community Members
  
We had a lot of bugs in the system,  in the cooperation it took. But
 
working with just one person, with Alice, we were able to make it. Her
 
whole main goal was to teach the children.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
One of the things, besides the fact that Alice is a good teacher, that makes
 
this program successful,  is that the administrators are invisible. Alice
 
and the kids are the focus.
 
Dr. Ruth Bennett, CCD
 
There is no controversy over Alice's qualifications in language proficiency
 
as she is one of the few Native Speakers, nor in cultural expertise as she is
 
knowledgable in traditional ways and is one of the Tribe's two Medicine Women.

Her continuing committment to the language and t
o the children has earned this
 
program the respect and gratitude of the community. The
 
individuals and various Tribal agencies in carrying out
 
by the reputation of the program, and the desire of the
 
cooperation of many
 
the classes, i
s bolster
 
people involved to p
 
the continuation of the program before their practical problems in carrying i
t out.
 
The two pre-school age programs also affect the most people in the Valley,
 
as all the children who attend these centers take the language class, unless their
 
parents specifically request otherwise(15). The children in turn affect the
 
parents and the home environment, and so the circle of influence grows.

.2 CROSS-GENERATIONAL LANGUAGE FEEDBACK
  
The dozen or so Native Speakers of the Hupa language are now all over 60
 
or 70 years old. In their childhood, the Bureau of Indian Affairs administered
 
the Hupa Indians as wards of the government.
 
Unfortunately, when the BIA came in and took over the administration
 
.of the Indian people, they were under the mistaken assumption that the
 
Indian people would fit into the mainstream much better if they did not
 
speak their language, or attend their rituals, the whole culture that we
 
had known, our Indian heritage, in order to facilitate that transfer. They
 
felt that if we just became white people, English speaking people, then
 
we would just be accepted into the mainstream of life more readily.
 
However, they had discounted the fact that we had been living this way
 
for thousands of years, and you just don't do it in ten, or twenty, or
 
a hundred years, or two hundred that we've been under them. That i
s part
 
of our being, part of our tradition, our heritage.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
It was the government Boarding School's responsibility to ensure that the
 
Indian children learned and spoke English.
 
We couldn't go home. We used to go home every Friday. If we got caught
 
talking Indian language, we couldn't go home. They washed our mouths out
 
with soap too. And it wasn't ordinary soap, it was that lye soap that they
 
used. They made that themselves, it was lye. Oh, that was terrible.
 
Alice Pratt, age70
 
The Indians of that time clung to their language tenaciously.
 
They thought i
t w as  ve ry  import ant.  And in any matters of real importance
 
that was the language they'd use, because they could express themselves
 
better, and people could understand better.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
However because of the punishments and negative attitudes toward Indian language
 
Davis -

and culture, these people didn't pass the language on to their children.
 
I stopped talking Indian to my children. I didn't bother about it any more.
 
It was no good, I thought. And that's why my son can't say a word of Indian,
 
no matter how much he tries!  (
she laughs)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70
 
My grandma speaks the language f
luently. My mom understands nothing.
 
Leslie Campbell, age 23
 
My father speaks the language. But he doesn't talk to us, his children.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
The consequences have been that the Elders have spoken Hupa to each other, but not
 
cross-generationally.
 
Sometimes I talk Indian to my friends on the phone. It's lots of fun.  (
she laughs)
 
Alice Pratt, age 70
 
We (
the few Native Speakers of Hupa) talk to each other in all ways, actually.
 
On the phone, or just in meeting one another, or when we have a Tribal
 
group, sometimes we have our Head Man come up, our religious leader,
 
Rudolf Socktish. He prefers to speak in his language because he feels more
 
comfortable. And it should be done that way. And I usually interpret for
 
him (
to the Tribal gathering).
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
With the introduction of the language programs in the last 15 years or so,
 
the Elders have been encouraged to pass their language and cultural knowledge on
 
to the younger generations who are eager to learn more about their heritage and
 
cultural identity.
 
My father speaks the language. But he doesn't talk to us (
his children).
 
But now my kids have the opportunity to take the language in Grammar
 
School. They're learning and that's stimulating him (her father, their
 
grandfather) into talking more to us in our language.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
The Elders speak the language fluently. The middle generation loses it.
 
Some can speak it, but the majority of them have lost it. And then the
 
young people are picking it back up again.
 
Leslie Campbell, age 23
 
It's a wonderful thing to have Alice teaching Indian language because
 
pretty soon there aren't going to be any more older people like her.
 
If she can teach these young children, and they can learn so fast, it's
 
wonderful. If we didn't have her, and these children weren't learning,
 
there would be nobody in a few more years. There'd be nobody speaking
 
it, and our older people would be gone, and there would be nobody to
 
look back to. Through these programs, tapes and things are being made.
 
It can go on through tapes and books, whatever. These kids can go on
 
learning it.
 
Laura Latham, age in 20's
 
The Elders teach the young children,  two or three generations removed from
 
themselves, and the children encourage their own parents, that middle generation
 
deprived of language information,  to learn more about the language.
 
Children are not learning their Indian language at home.  It's slipped away
 
with a lot of them (the Hupa families). When the parents hear the
 
children, as young as they are,  come home and start speaking Indian,
 
it encourages them.  They say,  I don't even know it and my kid's speaking
 
it and he's younger than I am.
 
Laura Latham,  age in 20's
 
The current generation of parents, people in their 20's through 40's, can't
 
speak Indian and can only understand a few words or phrases.
 
People in my generation can only say words, say '
hello' to each other,
 
but not conversations.
 
Marge Colegrove, age 36
 
The parents' lack of language skills deprives the children of a home setting
 
for Indian language acquisition or reinforcement. But the current atmosphere
 
of a general cultural renaissance, has encouraged young people to approach the
 
Elders for language and cultural information.
 
I
've seen a change in the young people. They want to know the language.
 
They'll sit in here and say, "I just love to hear you and somebody else
 
talk." That's the way to go. And they know it's real .
.. I
've had so many
 
young people tell me that.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62

.3 METHODS AND CURRICULUM FOR TEACHING INDIAN LANGUAGE
  
All the language classes are now serving two functions, as teaching
 
environments and as lab settings to develop curriculum materials for language.
 
There is a general feeling of frustration that the current curriculum and teaching
 
methodologies are not yet adequate to match the widespread enthusiasm in the
 
community for learning the language. However there is a great deal of effort
 
being put into filling these needs, by CCD, by HSU Bilingual Credential students,
 
by Marge Colegrove and Marion Mooney, by JOM, by the Klamath-Trinity School
 
District, and by Adrienne Drake and Victor Golla.
 
There are cultural enrichment aspects to all the language programs. Language,
 
culture and religion are inseparably interwoven in the Hupa bequeathal of identity.
 
It should be noted that there are also separate cultural enrichment programs in
 
Hoopa,  at the schools,  in the museum and in other Tribal efforts.  These
 
cultural programs involve language to some extent. But in terms of emphasis,
 
language is the central focus of the language programs,  and culture is the central
 
focus of the cultural programs.
 
5
.4 COOPERATION AND COMMUNICATION:  THE FUTURE OF INDIAN LANGUAGE AT HOOPA
 
A very great man once said,  "If you want to get rid of a people,
 
take away their language."
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
Unfortunately there is very little communication among the various language
 
programs,  in the sharing of materials,  in monitoring student reaction and
 
improvement to different teaching strategies, or in coordinating the six programs
 
into one concerted effort. A coordinated effort would seem to promise a reduction
 
in expenditure and paperwork,  the pooling of various resource skills and people,
 
and a channeling of energy and momentum to reach the language goals of the
 
Tribe and community before the dozen Native Speakers, all over 60 years of age,
 
are gone. Three reasons for the current lack of communication have surfaced in
 
this research.  The Tribe spends the major part of its time, money and human
 
resources on important legal cases,  leaving little for language or other cultural
 
programs.  There is a history of friction among the programs.  There are other Indi;
 
groups who live in Hoopa,  for whom there have never been language classes in the Valley.
 
There is skepticism among some people whether the language will survive.
 
I doubt that the language will be passed on, I doubt it. No one that I
've
 
heard, who is trying to talk Indian. When I go, I think it's going to be
 
all gone.
 
Alice Pratt, age 70
 
The older Native Speakers learned and used the language in many contexts. There
 
are younger people who hope that the language will survive because it is being
 
recorded and preserved.
 
Through these programs,  tapes and things are being made.  It can go on
 
through tapes and books (after the old people are gone).  These kids can
 
go on learning it.
 
Davis -

There are now language programs in a s
chool setting, but what needs to happen
 
if the language is to be carried on after the Elders are gone, i
s a reinforcement
 
of language speaking in many contexts: in the home--
I feel that I
've learned enough. I have four children and I can teach my
 
children. And I feel that the language will live on that way. They can
 
always teach someone else and talk to their friends.
 
Marge Colegrove, age 36
 
The Tribal people will tell you they think it's really important, but
 
whether they participate in it (
language programs) or not is another
 
thing. They don't follow up on it. If the child learns a word in the
 
Pre-School or the Day Care program, they might think it's really cute,
 
but then no one talks the language in the home. They don't encourage
 
the child to be around other Hupa speaking people. The parents don't
 
come into the school and sit with the child and learn the words themselves.
 
Adrienne Drake, age 47
 
I use the Indian words in my home a lot, words like '
sit down' and '
hurry
 
up',  '
no, yes'. Just the few words that I know, and I
'm interested in
 
learning more with the Indian language.
 
Laura Latham, age in 20's
 
in s
chool--
The School's philosophy i
s to mainstream the cultural and language
 
programs. The more information that the classroom teachers have about
 
the language and the culture, the more opportunities the kids are going
 
to have all day long to have it reinforced. But if they're just pulled
 
out for a half an hour, having language instruction, and then going back
 
to class, they will not get any reinforcement, as they would if that teacher
 
were their teacher all day long, and has a period of language along with
 
a period of math, a period of reading, etc.
 
Sally Biggin, Vice-principal of Hoopa Elementary School
 
in mass media--
Another plan i
s to put some of the Hupa language on tapes and produce
 
them o,er the air, locally here on the reservation, on KIDE-FM, the Tribal
 
radio station.
 
Adrienne Drake, age 47
 
and at religious ceremonies. 
You got to talk to everything you do in that hole (
the Brush Dance pit).
 
So when I come in, I talk to the walls, to the four corners. You pray
 
right there.
 
Alice Pratt, Medicine Woman, age 70
 
The language is very important in carrying out the Brush Dances. I f
eel
 
that I really lack in a lot of things, because I don't understand the
 
language completely. There are so many ancient words that I have no
 
knowledge of. If a spirit came to talk to me in the ancient language,
 
I wouldn't understand it.  (Adrienne later told me, off the tape, that the
 
spirits are so smart that they must surely have learned English by now,
 
and she laughed.)

.5 INDIAN LANGUAGE AS A VEHICLE OF INDIAN AUTHENTICITY
  
Indian people living at Hoopa are straddling the requirements of two cultures.
 
This engenders an unremitting ambivalence between the rewards of belonging to one
 
culture or the other, and fulfilling the obligations owing to two different sets
 
of rules. Each life situation asks for an unconscious decision -
-
 which culture
 
to follow?
 
The children in the language classes do not comprehend this greater context
 
of learning Indian language. Their loyalties are divided. They are loyal to their
 
peer group which watches cartoons instead of talking to their Hupa grandmothers,
 
which plays sports during school free time instead of attending an extra-curricular
 
language class. They are loyal to their families, and are rewarded with encouragement
 
if the family values tradition, discouraged by the non-interest of a non-traditional
 
family. They are obliged to a larger cultural context that is requiring them to
 
learn the skills and attitudes of a proper active adult in that world. In many
 
situations, these loyalties and obligations conflict, and the child must choo se  
over and over which group he will '
b elong
' to . Learning the Indian language has
 
meanings that vary within the contexts of each individual's loyalties, identifications
 
and cultural affiliations.
 
Although the language programs were s
et up t
o consciously preserve and p
 
on a traditional part of Indian life, the context of learning has changed, and
 
with it, so has the meaning that the child finds in learning the Indian language.
 
Traditionally, language was learned in the home, in infancy and childhood, as a
 
way of life. Identity formation was part of the traditional socialization process
 
that occured in the home and in the cultural institutions. Now as that way of life
 
is gone, learning the
 
in a classroom with a
 
children. Traditional
 
then formally taught.
 
language takes place in a decidedly Anglo-American style,
 
teacher, separate from the mainstream of life for these
 
cultural values have been re-interpreted and capsulized,
 
This formal teaching creates a selective identity and
 
Davis -
-
 33
 
language becomes an esoteric knowledge. It takes on the aura of sacred knowledge,
 
not the secular knowledge that Indian language used to be and that English
 
now i
s in their lives. To attend a language class has
 become a way for a
 
person to assert his '
Indian-ness' and language is a badge of '
authenticity'.
 
In the virtue of Indian orthodoxy through Indian language, there i
s passed on
 
a sense of well-being and worth, which is a consequence of these programs
 
perhaps more valuable more often than the acquisition of language competence
 
which no student has yet attained.
 
Indian language plays a primary cultural role in modern Hoopa for its
 
'
mythic' quality as a vehicle for defining the boundaries around Indian
 
authenticity. The Hupa leaders are vigorous definders of their cultural boundaries,
 
fighting against attempts to dispossess them of their land, their culture,
 
their natural resources, their ancestors bones, their religion and their language.
 
If myth i
s defined as "a sacred narrative of how people and the world came
 
to be in their present forms", then Indian language and traditional cultural
 
information are sacred and mythic, bequeathing the story of virtuous and orthodox
 
'
Indian ways and days' in an esoteric language reserved as a formal vehicle for
 
transmitting this mythic knowledge alone. The sacred nature of the knowledge being
 
taught explains the charismatic role of the individual teacher in the Indian
 
language programs, versus the standardized role of language teacher that theoretically
 
anyone with language training could fill. The life of the traditional Elder is
 
the cord that ties past to present, sacred to secular and thereby transfers the
 
essence of authenticity to the students. The individual is the sacred caretaker
 
of tradition and sacred tradition i
s what is being transmitted. Caretaker becomes
 
teacher and teacher becomes caretaker. All the teachers/caretakers are women:
 
Alice Pratt in the Pre-School and Day Care, Eleanor Abbott, Marge Colegrove and
 
Marion Mooney in the Elementary School, Adrienne Drake at the Career Cente
 
Ruth Bennett at HSU. The only two men are outsiders, educational consultar
i
 
Victor Colla and Tom Parsons. The f
riction among the language programs whic i
i
 
Davis -
-
 34
 
created the difficult situation for cooperation, is to a certain extent the
 
product of a jealousy over the control of '
Heritage', over the '
correct' forms
 
of selective knowledge to be passed on, over '
doctrinal' methods of teaching
 
that sacred knowledge, and especially over the '
authenticity' of the teacher!
 
caretakers. Alice Pratt i
s the most revered (
therefore qualified) teacher because
 
she i
s a Native Speaking Elder, and a Medicine Woman as well, the only perfect
 
combination. Ruth Bennett is the most controversial and the only non-Hupa person
 
actively involved in the language programs.
 
5
.6 CULTURAL HERITAGE AND SELF-IMAGE
  
The sensitive and eloquent s
tatements of Tribal people and community members
 
express the belief that a positive self-image i
s intimately rooted in self-
knowledge through cultural heritage.
 
The Tribe's long range goal i
s to get the people to understand the value of
 
their own language. A very great man said once, "If you want to get rid of
 
a people, take away their language." We realize that that's what could
 
happen. We've seen some erosion of our traditional cultural beliefs by our
 
young people. They just don't know about it. They haven't heard about i
t
 
through our language. So we see that that can happen. The tragedy of taking
 
away a people's language is that finally they are no longer a people.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
Learning the language makes children receptive to learning more of our
 
traditional and cultural-religious beliefs, because then they can realize
 
that we are a people. It's a form of identification which should start at
 
a very early age..
. It makes them feel very special. That was the harm that
 
was done by the early government in Indian relationships, they felt that
 
it wasn't worth very much and were ready to discard it. Now we think thert
 
i
s something in it. We are a people. We are an identifiable group. The
 
-
 language reinforces our identity.
 
Elsie Ricklefs, age 62
 
The language program is very important to the community, in any community,
 
or for any child, of any nationality or ethnic group to have some awareness
 
of where they belong, and what the really good points are about their
 
heritage. Because so often children are brought up and they are put down
 
for whatever they are. They don't have a sense of pride, and that's what's
 
really important, the child's self-concept and sense of self-worth. Through
 
having a language program, they can understand part of their heritage, and
 
what they have that's valuable. American Indian languages are so many, and
 
each one has such a small number of people that speak it, that the languages
 
can become lost and this i
s the only way of preserving it... In many cultures,
 
the Elder people are very important. But now in the kind of society we have,
 
people are losing the value and respect they have for their Elders, and this
 
i
s another form of contact that the children have with an Elder, when Alice
 
comes in and does the classes. .  .
It really gives the children a contact and
 
a special feeling for the Elder people.
 
Marsha Feinland, Director of the Day Care Center
 
Davis -

The language program gives the children a self-awareness, allows them t
o
 
discover who they are, where they fit in their society, to live in harmony
 
with the people there.  I think it does a lot for them-They know who they
 
are. They have all their resources here, animals, trees. We're all a part
 
of life, and we all fit together. They see how they fit together in the
 
puzzle, so they know who they are. Their singing and dancing (
the Hupa
 
religion), these have more meaning to them than i
t would to me. Because
 
to me that was a no-no thing, you don't do that. Now it's something that
 
you can do because you are an Indian, because you are you. There's more
 
pride in being an Indian now, than when I was growing up.
 
Elizabeth Marshall, age 41
 
The kids are really proud of what they have to share.
 
Sally Biggin, Vice-Principal Hoopa Elementary School
 
You teach respect by giving respect. That comes through very well in the
 
language program. When Elders come in the building, Indian people in
 
general show them a great deal of respect. That says it's OK to be
 
Indian, it's OK to old, and it's OK to respect other people.
 
John Biggin, Head Teacher Pre-School
 
I
'm proud to be an Indian and of my culture and my language. Being able
 
to speak some of my language after i
t's been gone s
o l
ong, in my generation,
 
feels good. It feels good to be able to learn it.
 
Laura Latham, age in 20's
 
I
'm turning into second grade next year. I
'm smart
 
older kids. I
'm learning Indian language good now.
 
Harold Marshall, age 7
 
The language i
s of a prime importance. If we lose our language completely,
 
and we lose our religion completely, then we're going to be just like
 
anyone else. We'll no longer be able to hold our religious dances, our
 
culture. We'll just be completely integrated into the white society.
 
That's the first thing. The s
econd reason I think that the language is
 
important is this. A lot of our people have a hard time in school, in
 
getting through school, bcause we speak broken English. We have the
 
Hupa language background. I find this in myself. I write backwards, because
 
that's the way the Hupa language is spoken. It has been a hindrance to us,
 
because language is a way to make people feel inferior. If you speak your
 
language and you can't speak adequate English, you're somehow inferior.
 
People make you feel inferior, they won'tsay you're inferior. But that has
 
a l
ot to do with why people have a low self-worth, a low self-concept.
 
Therefore the language is very important, that we pick up on it, get the
 
materials, record all the Elders, and preserve as much as we can preserve.
 
Otherwise we're going to lose our whole culture. Then we'll have no special
 
uniqueness, which I feel that we have now.
 
Adrienne Drake, age 47
 
The Hupa Tribe i
s attempting to avoid the l
oss of its language through these
 
language programs, through the education of its children. Therefore the language
 
programs involve the whole community, rather than the children alone. The children
 
are the catalysts in this system. They are acted on and in turn they cause reactions
 
in others.
 
Davis -

 36
 
The feeling of an Indian identity is a complex i
ssue that finds its roots in
 
many '
Indian' experiences and one of the most  'authentic', in the general opinion
 
of the reservation people, derives from some contact with the Indian language.  It
 
is felt to be '
right' and 'good'  to actively preserve and pass on the language.
 
This moral imperative invests the language programs with a sense of urgency and
 
emotion -
-
 dedication as well as conflict. Many people feel that the future of a
 
Tribal identity,  that feeling of  '
special uniqueness'  that Adrienne Drake talked
 
about, is fused to the continuity of the language programs. As the language goes,
 
so goes the '
Indian-ness' of the Tribe.
 
The Hupa Indian identity of 1982 has long taproots into the geography of
 
the Valley and the heritage of its ancestral ways. The language classes, a
 
modern development using a non-Indian Americanized style of teaching and
 
learning nonetheless strengthens that awareness of the historic and sacred past,
 
and anchors the present to it,  so that the Hupa community of today may discover
 
and preserve the unique nature of its identity.

 Native Speaker has a technical meaning, according to Dr. Victor Golla (personal
 
communication), which is,  simply stated, someone who still can speak the
 
first language he learned in childhood. However this term is used at Hoopa
 
as a synonym for a fluent speaker. Therefore Elsie Ricklefs who learned
 
English as her first language and learned Hupa when she was about ten years
 
old, is now a fluent speaker. Technically she is not a Native Speaker, but
 
by Hupa definition,  she is. While Elsie Ricklefs only lists 10 to 15
 
people as Native Speakers, Adrienne Drake consulted her mother Lila Colegrove,
 
an acknowledged Native Speaker, and compiled a list of 79 "Hupa Speaking
 
People 1982". The list is appended to this report.  I have chosen the low
 
figure of 10 to 15 Native Speakers as I have heard other Elders use
 
approximately the same number.

Hoopa Valley, California
 
Final report by Lee Davis
 
The l
ower course of the Trinity River flows n
ortherly t
hrough Hoopa Valley
 
in northwest California's Humboldt County. The principal,  twelve-mile-square
 
s
ection of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservatio ,,/is traversed by canyons and
 
hills surrounding the r
iver valley.  The Trinity has been designated a "wild
 
r
iver" by the s
tate of California
,4ts valley i
s i
solated by mountain ranges
 
on the east and west and by r
iver gorges on the north and south.
 
The Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation i
s r
ich in natural r
esources. Deer,
 
squirrel, black bear, fox, raccoon, rabbit, and puma are still hunted for food.
 
Among the r
enowned f
ish resources in the r
egion are salmon, t
rout, s
turgeon,
 
suckers, and eel. The main food plants utilized by the Indian people are
 
several varieties of acorns, pine nuts, and l
ily bulbs, as well a
s other nuts
 
and berries. The Indian people of Northern California also utilize animal
 
/ by-prod uct s,
 such as skins, antlers, feathers, b
one and shell, i
n addition t
o
 
plant materja ?jn woodworking and basketry
 
A
 
The HupA,,,/are Athapaskan_speaking Indians who continue t
o occupy a major
 
portion of their pre-contact territory. Their territory was set aside as a
 
r
eservation in 1
864, only a generation or two a
fter white contact. This
 
geographical and cultural continuity and relative lack of disruption (compared
 
t
o other California Indian groups) are major factors in the fact that
 
continuous language and cultural traditions exist a
s part of t
he present Native
 
American way of life a
t Hoopa.

The 1
980 U
.S. Census declared that more American Indian people l
ive in
 
California than in any other state. The Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation is
 
California's largest r
eservation, both in t
erms o
f t
erritory and population.
 
Approximately 1
,000 Hupa tribal members, 800 other Indian people, and 2
,200
 
non-Indians live on the reservation. The Hoopa Valley Business Council, a
 
tribal council for the Hupa people, maintains a Hupa Tribal Roll which lists
 
1
,640 t
ribal members, of whom 640 live off the r
eservation.5 /
 
History of the Hupa Indian Language School
 
The educational system a
t Hoopa began with a reservation school in the
 
1
870s and an Indian boarding school in 1893. The Hoopa boarding school b
ecame a
 
day school in 1
932. Presently the Hoopa Elementary School and the Hoopa High
 
School, both public schools in the Klamath-Trinity School District of Humboldt
 
County, serve the educational needs of the valley residents.
 
It i
s important to note the early philosophy governing t
he public
 
education of the Indian people at Hoopa. About 1880 the military agent a
t Fort
 
Gaston in command of the reservation devoted his attention t
o the
 
assimilation  of the Hupa.  "
If persuasion would not induce the Indians to
 
change, the agents were told t
o withhold rations /and, i
f necessary, use other
 
means to r
each the desired end!
/The boarding school emphasized "
practical"
 
skills. Instruction in manual (or menial) labor (farming, laundry, cooking, and
 
sewing) made up fifty percent of the curriculum.
 
3
 
The learning of English was to b
e the equalizing mechanism for the
 
achievement of the American melting pot ideal. Alice Pratt, now seventy,
 
r
ecalls the punishments for speaking t
he Indian language a
t t
he boarding
 
school.
 
We used t
o get punished for t
alking Indian at school. I
 
know many t
imes I couldn't come home because I got caught
 
talking Indian. -My dad used t
o bring t
he horse. He'd come
 
by horseback. He'd come up there, and I
'd tell him,  "
I
 
can't go home." "
What's the matter?" I said,  "
I t
alked
 
Indian." "
Oh, pshaw!" Everything would be "
Oh, pshaw" with
 
him.  (Alice l
aughs J/(ES82_LD_c1)
 
The memory of the educational system's harsh attitude regarding the Hupa
 
language i
s alive t
oday in anyone who attended t
he boarding school —that i
s,
 
anyone over sixty. Many, if not most, of the Elders learned that harsh lesson
 
well and would not t
each the language to their children, to spare them
 
criticism and punishment. Forty-one-year-old Elizabeth Marshall says:
 
When I was growing up, my parent's a
ttitude was not t
o give
 
us anything from our culture. They were punished at the
 
t
ime. They couldn't talk their language t
o their people. My
 
grandmother raised me. She said that that when she went to
 
school they were punished for talking their language. They
 
had to learn English; and they learned i
t real fast!
 
(
E582-u -c4)
 
The transmission of Hupa language skills in the home was so throttled by t
he
 
physical and social sanctions against Native American language and culture that
 
the passing on of language skills within the Tribe had effectively come to a
 
standstill in 1970, when the first formal language classes were initiated.
 
Today there are ten to fifteen  native speakers" of Hupa, all of whom are over
 
sixty years old.t

In t
he early 1
970s Tom Parsons began r
ecording the Hupa, Karok, Yurok, and
 
Tolowa Indian languages of northwest California. All the language programs that
 
were developed later had their r
oots in Tom Parsons early efforts. The social
 
movement t
o increase language awareness and skills in a more general atmosphere
 
of an "
Indian Renaissance" has sowed the seeds o
f a hopeful future for t
he
 
preservation and teaching of the Hupa language.
 
In t
he s
chool year of 1
981-1982, there were f
ive l
anguage programs active
 
on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, and a sixth related program at Humbo1
 
State University in Arcata, California, an hour and a half away. The six Hupa
 
,
,/ Zlndian language programs are listed below by 'age group. I
t should be noted
 
that these are also the only c
lasses for the Hupa language that exist anywhere.

s l
ocated in i
ts own building across from t
he
 
Bureau o
f Indian Affairs office on the part of the reservation called "
the
 
Campus "
.\i /
e language program was introduced into the school some two t
o t
hree
 
years ago, when the Center for Community Development (hereafter referred to as
 
CCD)11 and Alice Pratt, a native speaker, Elder, and tribal medicine woman,
 
began t
o develop a language program for small children. The school runs on a
 
nine -month school year, with a half-day session in the morning and another in
 
the afternoon. The morning session is the only one with a language class. Alice
 
Pratt arrives at approximately 9
:30 A
.M. or 10:00 A
.M. and t
eaches the
 
children, gathered into one group, for twenty minutes on Wednesday and
 
Thursday. After that she i
s driven to the Day Care Center for i
ts language
 
program.
 
The children at
 
the preschool range in age from two years . ns month8 t
o
 
five years. About forty preschool children were participating in the la
age
 
program at any one time during the 1
981-1982 school year. An average class
 
consisted of fifteen children, although at times there were thirty children in
 
the class. The language class was held in the preschool's language r
oom, which
 
also houses the library.
 
6
 
The instructional plan t
hat Alice uses in each class consists of t
eaching
 
the children t
o count from one t
o ten and name the body parts in Hupa. She
 
concludes the class by having the s
tudents sing "
The Bear Went over t
he
 
Mountain" in the Hupa language.
 
About once a month Dr. Ruth Bennett of the CCD accompanies Alice
 
class, bringing animal, puppets for the children t
o play with after the regular
 
language class. The children l
earn the animal names in Hupa and take on t
he
 
character of the animals in play acting. On special occasions another Elder who
 
speaks the language makes a presentation for the children. For example, Rudolf
 
Socktish, the Hupa spiritual leader, sang and played the traditional drum for
 
one class.
 
The children are enthusiastic about the language classes, although t
heir
 
attention span gets shorter as the year progresses. The parents feel very good
 
about the idea of their children's learning the Indian language, but, for the
 
most part, have not involved themselves in the classes per se. One set of
 
parents did not want their child included in the language class, however. They
 
felt that formal instruction in the Indian language was belittling and that, if
 
the child were t
o learn the language, it should happen at home. Nonetheless, in
 
general, there is a very positive attitude about the class among the parents.
 
The t
eachers a
t the preschool all support the idea of the children's
 
learning the Indian language, and all but one participate in the program,
 
gathering the children Logether when Alice arrives and encouraging them in
 
their efforts to learn the language at other times. Several of the teachers
 
feel that there should be improvements in the teaching methodology for
 
7
 
Preschool-age children. The program was developed several years ago and the
 
current teachers would like t
o contribute their expertise in early childhood
 
development t
o t
he language skills of Alice Pratt and the l
anguage t
eaching
 
experience of CCD. The p
'reseat program prepares the children for the elementary
 
school program by giving them a familiarity with t
he sounds o
f t
he language and
 
viding them with a basic vocabulary. One of the teacher's propo8al fo
 
improving the t
eaching methodology is to work t
he language curriculum into a
 
preschool format by integrating the auditory skills now required with visual
 
aids and movement.

Hoopa Elementary School
 
For approximately ten years, until the end of the 1
981-1982 school year,
 
there has been a Hpa i
.anguag
 rogr
un by the Klamath-T rinity  School  
District in the Hoops Valley Elementary School
'. Eleanor Abbott has been the
 
teacher, paid by the school district. She has a special teaching credential,
 
called the Eminent Domain Credential (EDC). The State of California has made a
 
provision for this cred ntjal t
o certify an individual who has informally
 
acquired the expertise to teach a sub Jecj ?pecifica Uy

he Hoopa area t
o r
eceive
 
C
—
 
the EDC. Ha taught in the h g  school up
.t l_his death- in- -
L980. Eleanor Abbott
 
-
had worked in the CCD for Tom Parsons and learned t
 
phabet used
 
there t
o record the Indian languages of northwest California. Tom Parsons
 
encouraged t
he school board t
o consider Eleanor for the EDC, and t
ogether Tom
 
and the Klamath-Trinity District petitioned the state for her credential.
 
Although Eleanor was not a native speaker, t
he c
redential was awarded with the
 
understanding that she would improve her language proficiency. While Elmer was
 
teaching in t
he high school, Eleanor taught Indian language in t
he elementary
 
school.
 
Because of the nature of this special credential, the only public school
 
classes which Eleanor is qualified to teach are the Indian language classes and
 
cultural enrichment programs. There are two o
ther Indian cultural specialists
 
in the elementary school —Anthony Risling and Cathy Colegrove —who carry out a
 
variety of cultural enrichment programs, but do not teach the Hupa language.
 
Eleanor's classes for students in kindergarten through third grade are
 
elective, require parental permission, and are held during the regular class
 
hours. The students leave their classrooms and go to Eleanor's room for the
 
language class. Her curriculum materials, developed by CCD, use the Unif
 on
 
alphabet. For the last two or three years many students in her classes have
 
come into this program with language skills learned from Alice Pratt in the
 
\
/ /preschool
. and day care language program. Eleanor reinforces the preschoolers "
 
skills through repetitfon, using flash cards and drill. There has been no
 
communication between Alice Pratt and Eleanor Abbott concerning the skills
 
9
 
taught to the preschoolers so that Eleanor would have a basis for follow-up
 
programs. The emphasis of her class i
s vocabulary development and cultural
 
enrichment.
 
There has b
een no problem securing the parental permission r
equired for
 
children to enroll in Eleanor's cla8s  and the
Ji1dren
,e bee
enthuajastjc . ....
 
about the idea of l
earning the Indian language. The classes have only been
 
fill ed during fifty percent of the class periods each day, however, and about
 
half of the 1
50 students that start the program drop out by the end of t
he
 
school year. One explanation may be lack of communication with and
 
encouragement by t
eachers in the other classes and parents. When a student
 
leaves the regular classroom in these early grades it is often treated by the
 
teacher as a disruption. Furthermore, if the student decides to s
top going t
o
 
language class, the parents do not often put pressure on the child t
o continue.
 
The school board voted to discontinue Eleanor's class at t
he end of the
 
1981-1982 school year, amidst a good deal of controversy.  According to the
 
school board's philosophy, it is important to incorporate Indian language and
 
culture into the regular classes. If all the teachers were trained in the
 
basics of Indian language and culture and could integrate these subjects into
 
the standard curriculum, say board members, the students would have more
 
opportunity to have their cultural education reinforced all day long. At this , 
point there is no reinforcement of language outside of the half-hour class,
 
since Indian language is a departmentalized program.
 
Another reason the school b
oard hesitates t
o maintain a s
eparate Hupa
 
language classroom and curriculum i
s its sensitivity to the needs of other
 
Indian groups represented in the Hoopa schools, especially the Yurok and Karok
 
people who attend
 
the schools in substantial numbers and whose languages have
 
never b
een taught there. -
Th±s northwest pocket of California presents an
 
interesting cultural anomaly in the anthropolgy of native North America. The
 
three t
ribes living there derive from Athapaskan (Hupa tribe), Hokan (Karok
 
tribe) and Algonquian (Yurok tribes) linguistic groups, yet they share
 
e
ssentially the same culture, religious beliefs, and behaviors. To t
each all
 
three languages on the reservation has been a greater burden than the school
 
district has been willing or able to bear to date.
 
In addition, there has been concern on the part of many educators about
 
the curriculum itself. The feeling is that the rote vocabulary activities
 
should be supplemented with audio-visual, multisensorial materials and a
 
variety o
f techniques that are geared to the age l
evels of the s
tudents. At
 
this point there seems to be a gulf between the philosophical and professional
 
concerns of the school and the pressing need of the Indian community to gain
 
the school board's cooperation in preserving and passing on what may otherwise
 
be a dying linguistic heritage.

 run and paid -
 for by CCD,
 taught by Marge Colegrove
 
with the assistance of Marion Mooney, who holds a standard California teaching
 
credential.
 
Marge Colegrove is the
.—daughter of the late Elmer Jarnaghan, Her classes  -
 
a
 held- in the Readi g Lab of the elementary
 
the Johnson- O'Malley Program. There are two s
essions, five days a week---a class
 
before school from 8
:15 A.M. to 9
:00 A.M. and a class during the school day
 
from 1
:15 P
.M. to 2
:00 P
.M. Eighteen students are enrolled in this
 
program —eight students in a combined fourth/fifth grade class, two sixth
 
graders, and eight eighth graders. For a while there were also five seventh
 
graders, who stopped coming because they shared the class with the eighth
 
graders and this created too much tension. The students in these classes have
 
generally been enrolled in earlier language
 
yet r
eached the fourth grade l
evel h
 
for
 
programs, which have only been in existence
 
classes, althougi no students have
 
attende4-the preschool
 
a few years.
 
Marge has tried twice to convince the school board to petition the state
 
for an EDC on her behalf, but to no avail. When her father, the first
 
credentialed (EDC) teacher of Indian language in Hoops Valley, passed away in
 
1980, the board felt that they already had a credentialed teacher in Eleanor
 
Abbott to take his place, so they would not credential Marge. There has been
 
community support for credentialing Marge. Tom Parsons of the CCD has appeared
 
before the board twice on her behalf, .
and the high school students presented a

M 
The school board has a
sked 1,a; Marge's class,to—give a language
 
performance t
o prove the quality of the program. This irritates her. She feels
 
s
ingled out from the other t
eachers and classes, who have n
ever b
een a
sked to
 
give a performance of skills. The school's philosophy i
s now against programs
 
which take students away from their regular classes, so there have been
 
problems with scheduli
 2&_kkarge.'
s_
  
and suggestions that _
she­offer­ her
 
classes before and after school and during lunch period, which she feels i
s
 
unfair t
o her and the students. There has also been the suggestion that Marge
 
sit in a section of an ongoing class and teach a few of t
he s
tudents, which she
 
feels would b
e distracting t
o the regular class as well as t
o the students
 
trying t
o l
earn this very difficult Indian language.
 
Marge has become frustrated and disillusioned with the school system after
 
\
,b c s
l�
 
teaching there for eight years without _
the—aciarow�e_
i 4ement 
-
-of--a x
-r
-aden
-tial.
 
What makes her return each fall, she says, i
s the kids who s
l e
ow the willpower
 
class and are determined t
o learn ths
 
Indian language. She feels that the language will not die since about 200
 
students have now been in the classes and have their notes. Her four children
 
are learning the language f
 rom her and will certainly carry i
t on.
 
Next year, without the Eleanor Abbott's classes for the k
indergarten
 
through third graders, Marge will be responsible for more grade levels in the
. 
elementary school. At that t
ime the school will provide the space and
 
non—curriculum materials for the class, and CCD will provide the salaries for
 
Marge and Marion and thi curriculum materials for the classes. CCD uses this
 
class as a lab setting to develop curriculum materials for the Humboldt State
 
1
3
 
Universit
 
Bilingual Credential Program.
 
Marion Mooney acts a
s t
he curriculum
 
specialist, developing the means, a game perhaps, through which Marge can
 
introduce t
he concepts and skills she wants t
o t
each.
 
Marion Mooney i
s not a native speaker, although she i
s learning the
 
language. Marge is also not a native speaker. She has-been -
studying-the.
 
language for ten years, however, and i
s probably the best Hupa speaker of her
 
age group (
she i
s 36 years old). Her father, Elmer Jarnaghan, was a native
 
speaker and her mother understood and spoke some Hupa. Marge i
s now teaching
 
her four children the language and Hupa is spoken in her home. Her
 
mother-in-law, Lila Colegrove, is a native speaker and her husband i
s a leader
 
in the Brush Dance ceremonies. The language and t
he culture are c
onstantly
 
reinforced in Marge's personal and professional life.
 
Such is not the case for most Hupa families, who have no l
anguage skills,-
.,
.
 
V so the children who learn words and phrases at school are not reinforced in 2e 
Indian language at home. The r
eligious ceremonies are the primary situations in
 
which a Hupa person can hear the language spoken correctly and abundantly, in
 
its proper context. The Elders use the opportunity t
o speak t
o each 
her in
 
Hupa, and the ceremonies themselves are conducted in the language. The interest
 
level in the language at Hoopa is very high now for people all ages. The
 
interest in language generated in the classroom is_be±i
picked
._ep in the hbT
h
 
as parents are inspired to either take a language class themselves or use their
 
family's Elders as resource people who can teach them Hupa. Some of the Elders
 
who did not speak Hupa t
o their own children are now encouraged t
o speak the
 
language to their grandchildren or great-grandchildren, who are
 
enthusiastically acquiring language skills. This intergenerational feedback
 
:
 
language learning environment in the home, and encourages and reinforces the
 
provides an opportunity for the children to apply their new skills, creates a
 
children in l
earning more about their language and culture.

the dictionary, and community members observe and participate in this process,
 
t
hereby learning the language. This class is very different from the other Hupa
 
anguage classes since there is no "
teacher" and no lesson plan. At the
 
/
 
b
eginning of each session either Adrienne or another class member chooses a
 
section of the dictionary and Adrienne reads that section a word at a time. The
 
Elders then say the word in Hupa several t
imes, so the class can practice the
 
sounds which do not exist in English and the pronunciation of the word. Often
 
discussion will result about a word —what it means, other Hupa words for the
 
same thing, the context of the word's use, and so forth. Sometimes a
 
controversy between the Elders over one of these i
ssues will arise. At other
 
t
imes a song, & story  or a complete digression will result.
 
This manner of conducting the class i
s flexible, low key, and
 
non- threatening for those involved, many of whom are not used t
o or may not be
 
comfortable with a standard classroom situation. In some ways i

 the mood of the class as a
 
whole. Sometimes the class lasts forty-five minutes, sometimes three hours or
 
A
 
more. People will often '
stay after class to socialize and discuss language and
 
culture anecdotally. Coffee is available during class and is served
 
respectfully to the Elders at some point.
 
There has been a maximum of about thirty—three students in a
.
, class, 
although the average is closer t
o fifteen. In the spring of 1
982u4/the Elders
 
participating in the class were Lila -Colegrove, Myrtle Moon, and Pearl Randall,
 
all native speakers �
r
 hey were paid by the Career Center from t
he Bureau o
f
 
Indian Affairs' Adult Education Program funds. No one else in the class was
 
paid. One s
tudent, Tammy Hostler, was receiving college credit from Humboldt
 
State University's bilingual program in which she is a student, however.
 
participate in the class and offered college credits for clas s part icipatio n.
 
The Career Center's class is unique among the six Hupa language classes
 
since i
t i
s the only one not affiliated with CCD and the only one that does not
 
use the Unifon alphabet. When Victor Golla presented the idea of the dictionary
 
to the tribe, they mutually decided to use the Modified International Phonetic
 
Alphabet (MIPA). This has caused some confusion, which could b
e aggravated i
f
 
there were ever a coordination of effort among the various language programs
 
and their two alphabet systems. The Elders were not comfortable with the Unifon
 
alphabet and supported Victor in his decision t
o abandon i
t in favor o  the
 
point, however, the on17 person who can listen to Hupa and record it in the

MIPA i
s Victor. There are several people who can record the language in Unifon:
 
Ruth Bennett, Marge Colegrove, probably Eleanor Abbott, and students in the
 
b
ilingual program at Humboldt State University.
 
During the su mmer of 1982, once Dr. Golla arrives, there will be workshops
 
run in the manner described above, but on an irregular

The Tribal Council supports language efforts in theory, but has allocated
 
little money to any of the language programs. I
t has contracted with Dr. Golla
 
to complete the dictionary and has established a fund for secretarial and
 
publishing costs. These allocations by the Tribal Council indicate their
 
goodwill and support for the language program. The tribe has been involved in
 
litigation for years, trying t
o save the valley's resources for the people.
 
Therefore, although education i
s stated to be a high priority, i
t i
s a low
 
priority in terms of funding. The Career Center itself has given priority t
o
 
getting high school diplomas for its students. There are many people in
 
positions of power at Hoopa —Tribal
. Council members and members of the tribe's
 
Education Committee —who believe that the language is dying and should not be
 
supported since Indian language skills will not help anyone get into college,
 
get a job, or support a family. Teaching esployable skills is worthwhile, they
 
feel, but language classes constitute a somewhat frivolous activity that
 
deserves a low funding priority in an era of dwindling budgetary r
esources.
 
In general, however, tribal members believe that the language is
 
important, whether they participate in the various programs or not.
 
Nonetheless, most families do not follow up on a child's interest in learning
 
1
8
 
Hupa by speaking and encouraging the Indian language in the home. Nor do they
 
encourage the child to be around Hupa-speaking people, or enter the classrooms
 
and l
earn the l
anguage with the child.
 
Adrienne Drake i
s an enthusiastic supporter of recording and preserving
 
the Hupa language. In her view it i
s of primary imp rtaqce in defining
. and
 
encouraging the unique nature of this group of people. The alternative i
s
 
integration and assimilation into white society, with a loss of self-esteem.
 
Hupa people often have difficulty with the English language. They are made t
o
 
feel inferior when they speak and write broken English, and this engenders a
 
low self-concept. Politically, the Indians of the valley have  been  battling
 t
o  
conserve their natural resources 4
ch as the Trinity River water, which is
 
threatened by the Peripheral Cana,1 
 Water Division i
ssue, and the salmon, whose
 
numbers dwindle every year
' hey have also been struggling to sustain the Hupa
 
r
eligion and i
ts ceremonial life and to maintain the subsistence-level living
 
conditions of the valley people. Their religion i

language. Th

Medicine Women —Alice Pratt and Adrienne Drake —in Hupa. For these educational,
 
Psychological, political, and religious reasons, Adrienne has continued her
 
efforts t

developed by Dr. Golla..

Humboldt State University's Bilingual Bicultural Credential Program
 
About seventeen years ago Tom Parsons started language programs for the
 
four Indian groups of northwest California —the Hupa, Karok, Yurok, and Tolowa
 
people —through the Center for Community Development (CCD) a
t Humboldt State
 
University in Arcata, California. This pioneering program has influenced
 
ways of thinking about and implementing Indian language preservation and
 
education on California's North Coast ever since. In 1
976 Parsons h
ired  t
i L
 
Bennett, who received her Ph.D, from the University of California at Berke e
 
in 1
980, to take over this effort since the CCD was diversifying i
ts interests.
 
Ruth worked on and off with CD until assuming her present position two years

While Ruth works with all four Indian groups, she lives in Hoopa and uses
 
i
t as a laboratory. CCD supports five of the six Hupa language programs with
 
funds or curriculum materials. It pays the salary of the language t
eachers in
 
the preschool, day care, and elem entary school extra-curricular programs. It
 
administers the bilingual program at Humboldt State and has provided curriculum
 
materials for all of these programs, as well as for Eleanor Abbott's program in
 
the elementary school. CCD has developed curriculum materials i
tself and has
 
20
 
Supported t
eachers and language students preparing curriculum materials. I
t
 
also periodically organizes workshops centered on curriculum, not on theory,
 
for t
eachers in Hoops.
 
Although no credentjaled t
eachers have yet graduated from the Humboldt
 
State program and returned t
o the Hoops community, former day care and
 
preschool t
eachers have left their jobs to enter this program a
s students. Ruth
 
has also played a key role in recording and preserving the Hupa language,
 
getting Elders t
o participate in all the language programs and actively
 
encouraging the Klamath-Trinity School Board, as well as the Tribal Council and
 
its various departments, to r
ecognize the important r
ole that the native
 
language could and should play in Hupa society.

Hupa M'-JE-E-D'N Day Care Center: An Ethnography Of Its Language Class
 
The day care center is a department of the Hoopa Valley Business Council,
 
commonly called the Hupa Tribal Council. The center is located in the
 
Neighborhood Facility and is an all-day program serving children from two to
 
c
­-
*
 
seven years
 This is the only one of the six programs that runs
 
continuously throughout the year ,
 that is, the only language program with
 
summer classes. Alice Pratt teachers Indian language on Wednesday and Thursday
 
at the day care center from 1
1:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon. She i
s driven there in
 
the Headstart van from the preschool, where she teaches just before on the same
 
days.

Upon arriving Alice goes to the kitchen area, where Charlotte Colegrove,
 
the cook, has a cup of coffee for her. They chat and then Alice enters the
 
classroom with her coffee. The class i
s held in the room where lunch is later
 
served,  and i
t i
s closed off for the clas . The stid its are
 
-
.
teaehers--in groups of three to six. Each clag
j
.asts
  fro
t a_
q
.twenty... 
minutes, and the next group of children i
s then brought in. Between one and
 
four c
lasses are held per hour, depending on how many students are in school
 
that day. Alice may b
e the only adult in the room, although one of the day care
 
t
eachers usually observes the classes. On Thursday Ruth Bennett will often
 
accompany and assist Alice Pratt, bringing specially made puppets of the
 
animals in Indian legends.
 
Alice follows a standard t
eaching procedure. She chats with the children
 
as they enter, while sitting at a table shaped like a kidney bean. The children
 
sit in chairs arranged along the outside of the table, facing Alice. She
 
generally starts the class by counting from one t
o ten, first saying the number
 
in English, then in Indian, while pointing to her fingers. As the children are
 
quite proficient in this exercise, Alice will often have them repeat the
 
counting if their attention wanders or they misbehave. Counting i
s a familiar
 
guidepost t
o which Alice returns the children t
o focus their attention back to
 
the lesson. She then enumerates the body parts, first in English, then in Hupa,
 
while pointing t
o the part of the body. Interspersed with this routine Alice
 
interacts with the children in Hupa using such phrases as: "
I told you,'  Don't
 
bother that," "
Sit down " "Don't do that," "
I'm leaving," "
I'll see you again,'
 
"
I am talking," "Wait a minute," "
Do you understand?" "
What i
s i
t?" "
What are
 
22
 
you saying?" "What are you doing?" "
I'm glad to see you," "
How are you?" "
Shut
 
your
 mouth," "
You go, no ears (
scolding a child)," "
I'll do that today," "
Don't
 
say that," "
You're scared," "
It s
tinks," and "
You crazy Indian, you."
 
She also will include stories about what life was l

child and about what it was l

During the class itself, Ruth may lead the children in the correct Hupa
 
response to Alice's questioning in English and discipline the children in the
 
proper respect for Alice —"Pay attention, - "
Show respect," "
Don't be silly,"
 
"Don't bother things" —both in English and in Indian.
 
Seventy-year-old Alice Pratt is one of a dozen native- anguage speakers in
 
Hoopa. She i
s a respected Elder and a Medicine Woman in religious ceremonies.
 
Her family came from an area in Hoops
, Valley that is just below her present
 
house. Her parents spoke Hupa in the home, and she didn't learn English until
 
she went to the boarding school in Hoops. She often tells the story of being
 
punished for talking Indian at boarding school. The lesson that Alice and the
 
other people of her generation learned from that was that it was unacceptable
 
to speak Hupa, that to move forward into the modern world they would have to
 
leave behind their Indian culture. They did not talk Indian to their children,
 
except for words and phtases. Their children grew up speaking English and
 
understanding some Hupa, if their parents still spoke it to each other. As
 
Elsie Ricklefs points our, however, the old people,
 
25
 
clung t
o the language tenaciously, those who did speak it.
 
They thought that i
t was very important. And in any matter
 
of real importance, that was the language they'd use,
 
because they could express themselves better. People could
 
understand better, because it was much deeper than some of
 
the translations that we had. People on the outside would
 
take verbatim reports. When it came out  translated, it was
 
not really accurate and did not r
eflect t
he true feeling
 
and meaning of what the Indian people were trying t
o say.
 
(ES82-LD-C3)
 
Alice stopped speaking Indian t
o her own c
hildren; she t
hought i
t was n
o
 
good. Her son Alex and her daughter Jean do not speak Hupa, but her son Edgar
 
knows some Indian. With the resurgence of interest in their heritage among the
 
Hupa people, Alice has begun t
o teach the language t
o her great -grandchildren,
 
whom she looks after, and they learn quickly. In the last few years young
 
people in Alice's family have gone to her often as a resource person for
 
kl
 
learning the language. Laura Latham,
 step-
'
granddaughter, was a student
 
years ago in Elmer Jarnaghan's
 ass at Hoopa High School. After she graduated
 
from high school she began losing her skills due t
o lack of opportunity for
 
speaking. She went to Alice and tape recorded her speaking Hupa. Laura now
 
works at the day care center, where she assists and observes in the language
 
classes. Her son T. R
. came home with Indian words, which made her proud. She
 
has made the effort to improve her own language skills by listening to the
 
tapes that Alice made for her, by using Hupa in the home, and by encourageing
 
T
. R
. to speak Hupa as well. Laura is proud to be an Indian and to participate
 
in Indian culture. She i
s proud that she has the opportunity to learn and speak
 
the language after it has been gone so long.
 
About three years ago Ruth Bennett first asked Alice to teach the Indian
 
language to little children. It was the first t
ime that Alice had actually
 
taught the language. Until that t
ime she spoke Hupa to other older people and
 
26
 
participated minimally in intergenerationa' language transmission. Her
 
interest in passing on the language, seeking out younger people, and developing
 
a new set of r
oles for herself has resulted in her adding t
he role of
 
teacher—student t
o th& previous ones of Elder and native speaker.
 
The language class at the day care center enjoys great  
community ,
,appr oval
 
and prestige, due in large part to the reputation, language skills, and
 
personality of Alice Pratt. I
t has been unusually successful in sustaining a
 
widespread cooperative effort among various agencies within the Hupa Tribe, a
s
 
well as with outside agencies a
t the university.

accomodates cultural programs by giving them priority over the regularly

he
 
continuity of one teacher, Alice Pratt, in the language program i
s a key to tha> —

Headstart's educational component and is consonant with its philosophy of
 
cultural preservation through education. F

Students
 
I had two major impressions from interviews and informal conversations
 
with day care students from two through six years old. First, the children, for
 
the most part, were enthusiastic about Alice and the language c
lass, as
 
demonstrated by remarks such as "
I like class" and "Alice is pretty." Second,
 
the children knew who in their families could talk Indian, which indicates that
 
Hupa is being spoken at home. The children have learned who will reinforce
 
their newly acquired language skills by interacting with them in Hupa.
 
28
 
Teachers
 
The day care center teachers, who are all Indian, support the language
 
program, are flexible enough with their own schedules to accommodate any
 
language or cultural activity, and encourage t
he children to use their language
 
skills outside o
f class. As Ruth Bennett comments,
 
Sherry Nixon [head t
eacher] is r
eal interested in t
he
 
language. She's been in the language class [
at the Career
 
Center].  .
 .
 .
 Alice goes in the day care class. The
 
teachers aides help get the kids together, and get the kids
 
in groups. And now Laura [
Latham] gets the kids organized
 
and gets them together. We teach the class, and when that
 
group i
s done, they bring in another group. We get a lot of
 
cooperation in terms of having the class taught and haviu
 
it go in an effective way.  .
 .
 .
 That's one of the things,
 
beside the fact that Alice is a good teacher, that makes
 
this successful —that the administrators are invisible.
 
Alice and the kids are the focus. (ES82-LD-Cl)
 
Marsha Feinland, director of the day care center, adds,
 
The teachers think the language class i
s a very important
 
program. They've been cooperative in accompanying the
 
children t
o the lessons and in changing their schedules
 
whenever necessary. Whatever lessons they had planned, they
 
held them in limbo, whatever-they needed-to do, to
 
accommodate the language classes or any cultural programs.
 
All the staff members here are American Indian except for
 
myself, and they all feel that it's very important for the
 
children to learn about their culture. (ES82-LD-C3)
 
Some of the t
eachers in the past have been so enthusiastic about the value of
 
the language program that they have quit their jobs to enroll in Humboldt State
 
University's Bilingual Credential Program.
 
The parents

1 the Hupa language. Says Ruth Bennett
 
There was a survey done by Steve Carr, education director,
 
of the attitudes of preschool and day care parents to
  
-
- dif f
tLent- PrOgramV. Language got the highest support among
 
thirteen different things that the parents were asked their
 
opinion of. Language was e
ither first, second, or t
hird
 
choice of all the parents. And i
t was first choice o
f a lot
 
of them. There's a lot o
f interest in the language.
 
There have been many instances in which the child has come home from preschool
 
or day care saying Indian words. This stirs the pride of the parents in the
 
chil  an _
19-
EK
-K- in their own Indian heritage. The parents may even be motivate-d
 
t
o learn some of the language themselves. As twenty-year-old Laura Latham
 
anything  
30
 
There i
s no controversy over Alice's qualifications. She i
s one of t
he few
 
native speakers. She is also knowledgeable in traditional ways and i
s one o
f
 
the tribe's two Medicine Women. Her co tinuing commitment to the language and
 
to the children has earned the day care program the respect and gratitude of
 
the community. The cooperation of many individuals and various tribal agencies   
in offering the classes i
s bolstered by the reputation of the program and the
 
desire of the people involved to make its continuation a priority.
 
Of all the language programs in the valley, the day care preschool
 
programs also affect the most people, since all the children who attend those
 
programs take the language class, unless their parents specifically request
 
otherwise. The children in turn affect the parents and the home environment,
 
and so the circle of influence grows.  "
It's a wonderful thing to have Alice
 
teaching Indian language because pretty soon there aren't going to be any more
 
older people like her," says Laura Latham.
 
If she can teach these young children, and they can learn
 
so fast, it's wonderful. If we didn't have her, and these
 
children weren't learning, there would be nobody in a few
 
more years. There'd be nobody speaking it, and our older
 
people would be gone and there would be nobody t
o look back
 
to. Through these programs, tapes and things are being
 
made. It can go on t
hrough tapes and books, whatever. These
 
kids can go on learning it. (ES82-L.D-CIO)
 
The Elders t
each the young children, two or three generations removed from
 
themselves, and the children encourage their own parents, that middle
 
generation deprived of language, to learn more about the language.  "
Children
 
are not learning their Indian language at home," notes Laura.  "
It's slipped
 
away with a lot of them. When t

are, come home and start speaking Indian, it encourages them. They say, '
I
 
3
1
 
don't even know it, and my kid's speaking it, and he's younger t
han I am.'" The
 
parents' lack of language skills deprives the children of a home setting for
 
Indian language acquisition or r
einforcement. But the current a
tmosphere of a
 
general cultural renaissance has encouraged young people to approach the Elders
 
f
or language and cultural information.  "
I've seen a change in the young
 
people," says Elsie Ricklefs.  "
They want t
o know the language. They'll sit in
 
here and say,  '
I just love t
o hear you and somebody else talk.' That's the way
 
t
o go. And they know it's real. .
 .
 .
 I
've had so many young people tell me
 
that." (

The Future of Indian Language at Hoopa
 
Unfortunately, there i
s very little communication among t
he various
 
language programs at Hoopa in the sharing of materials, monitoring student
 
r
eaction and improving t
eaching strategies, or coordinating t
he s
ix programs
 
into one concerted effort. A coordinated effort would seem to promise a
 
reduction in expenditure and paperwork, the pooling of various resource skills
 
and people, and a channeling of energy to reach the language goals of the tribe
 
and community before the dozen native speakers, all over sixty years of age,
 
are gone. Three reasons for the current lack of communication surfaced during
 
my research: 1
) the tribe spends the major part of its time, money, and human
 
resources on important legal cases, leaving little for language or other
 
cultural programs; 2
) there is a history of friction among the programs; and 3
)
 
there are also other Indian groups who live in Hoopa, for whom there have never
 
been language classes in the valley.
 
32
 
There are currently language programs in a school setting, but, if the
 
language is to be carried on after the Elders are gone,  it must be reinforced
 
in many contexts: in the home —
 
I feel that I
've learned enough.  I have four children and I
 
can teach my children. And I feel that the language will
 
live on that way. They can always teach someone else and
 
talk to their friends. (ES82-Ln-c6)
 
Marge Colegrove
 
The tribal people will tell you they think it's really
 
important, but whether they participate in it [the language
 
programs]  or not is another thing. They don't follow up on
 
it. If the child learns a word in the preschool or the day
 
care program,  they might think it's really cute, but then
 
no one talks the language in the home. They don't encourage
 
the child to be around other Hupa-speaking people. The
 
parents don't come into the school and sit with the child
 
and learn the words themselves.  (ES82-LD-CIO)
 
Laura Latham
 
in school
 
The school's philosophy is to mainstream the cultural and
 
language programs. The more information that the classroom
 
teachers have about the language and the culture, the more
 
opportunities the kids are going to have all day long to
 
have it reinforced. But if they're just pulled out for a
 
half an hour, having language instruction and then going
 
back to class, they will not get any reinforcement, as they
 
would if that teacher were their teacher all day long and
 
has a period of language along with a period of math, a
 
period of reading, etc. (ES82-LD-05)

Hupa As a Vehicle of Indian Culture
 
Indian people l
iving at Hoopa are straddling t
he requirements of two
 
cultures. This engenders an unremitting ambivalence regarding the rewards of
 
belonging to one culture or the other and fulfilling the obligations owing t
o
 
two different sets of cultural rules. Each life situation asks for an
 
unconscious decision —which culture to follow?
 
The children in the language classes do not comprehend the greater context
 
of learning Indian language. Their loyalties are divided. They are loyal t
o
 
their peer group, which watches cartoons instead of talking t
o their Hupa
 
'  grandmothers, which plays sports during free t
ime at school instead of
 
attending an extra-curricular language class. They are loyal t
o their families
 
and are rewarded with encouragement, if the family values tradition, or
 
discouragement, if the family is not interested in tradition. They are obliged
 
to a larger cultural context that is requiring them to learn the skills and
 
attitudes of an active adult in that world. In many situations these loyalties
 
3
4
 
and obligations conflict, and the child must choose over and over again which
 
group he will "
belong" to. Learning the Indian language has meanings that vary
 
within the c
ontexts of each individual's loyalties, identifications, and
 
cultural affiliations.
 
Although the language programs were set up t
o consciously preserve and
 
pass on a traditional part of Indian life, the context of learning has changed
 
and, with it, the meaning that the child finds in learning the Indian language.
 
Traditionally, language was learned in the home, during infancy and childhood,
 
--
.
.,/as part of a way of l
ife. Identity formation was part of the traditional
 
socialization process that occurred in the home and in  hi cultural
 
institutions. Now, since that way of life is gone, learning the language takes
 
place in a decidedly Anglo-American style —in a classroom with a teacher,
 
separated from the mainstream of life for these children. Traditional cultural
 
values have been reinterpreted, capsulized, and then formally taught. This
 
formal teaching creates a selective identity and language becomes an esoteric
 
knowledge. It takes on the aura of sacred knowledge, not the secular knowledge
 
that Indian language used to be and that English now is in their lives. To
 
attend a language class has become a way for a person to assert his
 
"
Indian-ness," and language is a badge of "
authenticity." Along with Indian
 
_
-ç
 
orthodo y $h 
 gh-L dian..-language, a sense of well-being and worth i..passed —
 
which is perhaps more valuable than the acquisition of language competence
 
which no student has yet attained.
 
Indian language plays a primary cultural role in modern Hoopa because of
 
its mythic quality as a vehicle for defining the boundaries around Indian
 
authenticity. The Hupa leaders are vigorous defenders of their cultural
 
35
 
boundaries, fighting against attempts to dispossess them of their land, their
 
culture, their natural resources, their ancestors' bones, their religion, and
 
their l
anguage.
 
/
 
I
f myth i
s defined as  "
sacred narrative o
f how people and t
he world came
 
to be in their present forms' then Indian language and traditional cultural
 
information are sacred and mythic, bequeathing the story of virtuous and
 
orthodox "
Indian ways and days" in an esoteric language reserved as a formal
 
vehicle solely for transmitting this mythic knowledge. The sacred nature of t
he
 
knowledge being taught explains the charismatic role of the individual teacher
 
in the Indian language programs, versus the standardized role of language
 
teacher that, theoretically, anyone with language training could fill. The l
ife
 
of the traditional Elder i
s the cord that ties past to present, sacred t
o
 
secular, and thereby transfers the essence of authenticity to the students. The
 
individual is the sacred caretaker of tradition and sacred t
radition is what i
s
 
b'ing transmitted. Caretaker becomes teacher an d teac
her  becomes
 careta
ker . All
 
L
z
 
the teachers'/caretakers are women: Mice Pratt in the preschool and day care,
 
Eleanor Abbott, Marge Colegrove, and Marion Mooney in the elementary school,
 
Adrienne Drake at the Career Center, and Ruth Bennett at Humboldt State
 
University. The only two men —Victor Golla and Tom Parsons —are education
 
consultants from outside of the community. The friction among the language
 
programs which has created the difficulties for cooperation is, t
o a certain
 
extent, the product of a jealousy over the control of "heritage," over the
 
"correct" forms of the selective knowledge to be passed on, over doctrinal
 
methods of teaching the sacred knowledge, and especially over the
 
3
6
 
"
authenticity" o
f the t
eacher/caretakers. Alice Pratt i
s t
he most r
evered
 
teacher because she is a native speaker, an Elder, and a Medicine Woman —a
 
perfect combination.
 
The sensitive and eloquent statements by tribal people and community
 
members express the belief that a positive self-image i
s intimately rooted in
 
self-knowledge through cultural heritage.
 
The tribe's long-range goal i
s to get the people to
 
understand the value of their own language. A very great
 
man said once,  "If you want to get rid of a people, take
 
away their language." We r
ealize that that's what c
ould
 
happen. We've seen some erosion of our traditional cultural
 
beliefs by our young people. They Just don't know about i
t.
 
They haven't heard about it through our language. So we see
 
that that can happen. The tr
edy of taking away a people's
 
language i
s that finally that-are no longer a people.
 
(
Es82-LD--c3)
 
Elsie Ricklefs
 
The language program i
s very important t
o the community, in
 
any community, or for any child of any nationality or
 
ethnic group, to have some awareness of where they belong
 
and what the really good points are about their heritage.
 
Because so often children are brought up and they are put
 
down for whatever they are. They don't have a sense of
 
pride, and that's what's really important —the child's
 
self-concept and sense of self-worth. Through having a
 
language program they can understand part of their heritage
 
and what they have that's valuable. (ES82-LD-C3)
 
Marsha Feinland
 
The language program gives the children a self-awareness,
 
allows them to discover who they are, where they fit in
 
their society, to live in harmony with the people there. I
 
think it does a lot for them. They know who they are. They
 
have al
l their resources here —animals, trees. We're al
l a
 
part of life and we all fit together. They see how they fit
 
together in -the puzz18, so they know who they are. Their
 
singing and dancing [
the Hupa religion], these have more
 
meaning to them than it would to me. Because to me that was
 
a no-no thin
,g,
u don't do that. Now it's something chat  *
 
37
 
you can do because you are an Indian, because you are you.
 
There's more pride in being an Indian now than when I was
 
growing up.  (ES82-LD-c4)
 
Elizabeth Marshall
 
The language is of a prime importance.  If we lose our
 
language complete y  and we la"  our   
aligi
 o plctcly,
 
then we're going to be just like anyone else. We'll no
 
longer be able to hold our religious dances, our culture.
 
We'll just be completely integrated into the white society.
 
That's the first thing. The second reason I think that the
 
language i
s important i
s this. A lot of our people have a
 
hard t
ime in school, in getting through school, because we
 
speak broken English; we have the Hupa language background.
 
.
1 find this in myself.  I write backwards because that's
 
/ the way the Hupa language
 is spo
ken.  It  has  been
 a 
\/
 hindrance to u
s,- ecause lang u
age is a way  o
' make people
 
feel inferior. '
 
ff you speak your la nguage
,
! and you can't
 
speak adequate English, you're somehow inferior. People 
make you feel inferior  they won't say you're inferior,  but
 
that has a lot to do  t
'th -why people have a low self-worth,
 
a low self-concept. Therefore,  the language is very
 
important
T
hat we pick up on it, get the materials, record
 
all the Elders, and preserve as much as we can preserve.
 
O therwise Awe tre going to lose our whole cu lt ure
. Then  we
'll  
have no 4 ecia1 uniqueness, which I feel that we have now.
 
(Es82_LDLc9)
 
Adrienne Drake
 
The Hupa Tribe i
s attempting t
o avoid the loss of its language through the
 
language programs which educate its children. Therefore, the language programs
 
involve the whole community, rather than the children alone. The children are
 
the catalysts in this system —they are acted on and, in turn, they cause
 
reactions in others.
 
The feeling of Indian identity is a complex issue that finds its roots in many
 
Indian experiences. One 'of the most authentic, in the general opinion of the
 
reservation's people, derives from some contact with the Indian language. It is
 
felt to be "
right  and "
good" t
o actively preserve and pass on the language.
 
This moral imperative -
invests the language programs with a sense of urgency and
 
emotion, generating dedication a
s well as conflict. Many people feel that the
