JM: Okay. Uh, we are delighted today to be with Dr. Thomas Gaither and, um, thank you 
for the warm welcome, professor. 
 
Thomas Gaither: You’re welcome. 
 
JM: And, and, and we, I, I want to, I want to mention that we had a lovely tour – 
 
TG: [laughs] 
 
JM: Of your beautiful gardens before we started and that was an extra special treat. 
 
TG: My pleasure. [laughs] 
 
JM: Thank you so much. Uh, it was lovely, just beautiful. Um, let me, um, let me invite 
you to start today just with talking a little bit about your, maybe your parents and coming up in, 
in Great Falls, South Carolina. 
 
TG: My parents, uh, were Walter B. Gaither and Fannie M. Little Gaither. Uh, Great 
Falls was my father’s home. Uh, my mother, Fannie Mae, was originally from Anderson, South 
Carolina, and, uh, my mom and dad met while they were students at Friendship Jr. College in 
Rock Hill, South Carolina. Uh, after they, uh, both graduated from Friendship, uh, they, of 
course, moved, uh, permanently to Great Falls. Um, and, uh, initially, they were both 
schoolteachers. Um, you could be a schoolteacher at that time with just a junior college, uh, 
education. Um, my dad did not stay in teaching because he discovered that what was listed on his 
contract as his per month, uh, payment for teaching was not the same as he was receiving and, 
uh, this was at a time when the, uh, boards of education were all composed of white men. And so 
at the end of the year, my father approached the person who sounded, who signed his voucher 
for, uh, payment and said, “I noticed that there is a discrepancy here.” It was a five-dollar 
difference between what he was supposed to be paid, be paid, and what he was receiving. And 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 3 of 63 
 
for questioning the five-dollar differential, which the school board member was pocketing, my 
father was terminated as, as a teacher.  
My mother continued to be a teacher and in fact, my first seven years of formal education 
was in a one-room school. Uh, at that time, one-room schools, uh, in that area of South Carolina 
were actually owned by churches. The state paid the salary of the teacher, but, uh, various 
churches across the community had a school. So mine happened to be Pleasant Grove, uh, uh, 
School. Pleasant Grove was a nearby A.M.E. Zion, uh, church. So for the first, uh, seven years of 
my education, that’s where I learned to count, to read, to write, and, uh, all of those, uh, kinds of, 
uh, all of those kinds of things. Uh, the good thing about the, um, one-room school was that if 
you were in third grade, you could hear the lessons for the fourth grade, the fifth grade, sixth, and 
so on up the line. So you were on stage at some point, but otherwise you were reviewing all the 
time if you wanted to be, uh, reviewing all the time.  
We had to take to the school a jar that we took a piece of adhesive tape and we put our 
name on that adhesive tape on the jar and we turned it upside down by the cooler, which was 
present at the back of the room. Uh, we, of course, had no fountains or anything of that sort. But 
right in the middle of the room, we had this, uh, very large diameter drum that was the heater, 
and it was never possible to have heat in that room that was even. Uh, you would think that, ah, 
it’s going to work today [5:00] and then all of a sudden, the lid to the heater would start floating 
up and down and the whole place would be smoked up, and then we would have to open the 
windows. Ah, and that was, that was a little bit of a sample of the environment.  
We didn’t have a library. Uh, there was a dictionary, but I think the dictionary was owned 
by my mother as the teacher. We didn’t know very many of the white kids in the community, 
except by looking in the textbooks that were passed on to us. We could see the kids, the white 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 4 of 63 
 
kids would have used the books and rather than throw them away, I will say [laughs], they 
would, they would send them or they would, uh, they would ship them to us.  
Um, my mother remained in teaching, uh, until the consolidation of schools. That would 
have been in the early 1950s. The Supreme Court decision was 1954, but before that, there was 
some movement in, in teaching. In fact, it was rather amazing that as soon as the South found out 
that there might be this law banning discrimination or segregation in, uh, in, in schools, uh, 
suddenly the schools went up and that’s sort of interesting because we were supposed to be 
separate, but equal all the time. But all of a sudden, there’s a new black elementary school here. 
There’s one there. There’s one there. Now it turns out that I lived right on the edge of two 
counties, Fairfield County and Chester County. The nearest, um, school in Fairfield County was 
about seventeen miles away at Winnsboro [South Carolina], but the school in Chester County 
was just, uh, about two and a half miles away. So actually I went to, uh, elementary school in, 
uh, I’m sorry, I went to high school in, uh, Chester County after the seven years in the one-room 
school where my mother was the, uh, the teacher.  
Uh, the center of the community for my parents was the church. Uh, we went to church 
every Sunday. We went to Sunday school. When there were special days, we participated in the 
programs. In fact, the first time I remember speaking before an audience of anyone other than my 
parents would have been at Children’s Day at the, uh, local church. 
JM: And your church was which? 
TG: Uh, Pleasant Grove A.M.E. Zion Church. Uh, the, uh, district that my church was in 
was the Columbia-Camden district and ministers, uh, served a variable, uh, uh, period of time as 
the pastors of churches and, uh, there was a time very early in my life when we had preaching 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 5 of 63 
 
only on alternate Sundays. But, uh, at some point when there was a little bit more capital 
flowing, uh, it got to the point that we had church, we had church every Sunday.  
JM: Yeah. You mentioned your father left teaching. How old were you when that 
happened? Or was forced out of teaching, I should say. 
 
TG: Hmm, how old would I have been then? 
 
JM: Approximately. 
 
TG: Uh, I must have been eleven or twelve, some place in there. 
 
JM: Was that, was, was the cause of his termination explained to you at the time as a 
child of that age or did you learn that later? 
 
TG: Uh, no, no. I learned that later. 
 
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
 
TG: Yeah. It was, uh, it, it, the trustee boards were all white men, but there was usually a 
figurehead trustee board of black men, and these black men were chosen by the white men and 
they were usually people who would not ask questions, who would not rock the boat. So, uh, 
that’s, that’s the way the, the, the boards were, uh, structured.  
So after, uh, losing his job as a teacher, my father went to work at a, uh, cotton mill. 
Since he has a junior college education, rather than taking the jobs that, or getting the jobs that 
were traditional for black men of that day – now this was before the era of power lawnmowers. 
So there was a yard crew that was all black, and blacks also worked in some of the rooms where 
the cotton was rendered into cloth that were particularly dir – dirty, the ones where you’d get 
bissinosis [or “brown lung”] from breathing cotton fibers and, uh, that sort of, uh, thing. My dad 
worked as a fireman, another dirty job, but the fireman had two responsibilities. It was to keep 
the steam in the boiler plant up to a particular point where all the machines would operate, but, 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 6 of 63 
 
uh, you would do that by putting the coal in the furnace. And while that was heating up, you’d 
have some ideas as to how much to put in because of the experience of having done the job 
before. [10:00] They had to go around the mill and stick a key in a little box and turn the key. So 
they were night watchmen. So they did those kinds, two jobs, uh, together.  
Well, at some point, my father lost that job, too. Uh, I suspect, although I’m not sure, that 
it was because of his progressive posture on most things, including, uh, equal rights – the right to 
vote, the right to get a decent education, and so forth and so on. So in 19 – early 1950, my father 
decided to go back to college with five kids and, uh, with, uh, only jobs that he could do – I 
should say this about him. My father was, uh, capable of doing a variety of, uh, chores. He could, 
he could wire. He could, uh, do brick work. He could do carpentry. He could do all of these, uh, 
things, and he would get jobs from people in the community. So while he was doing these kinds 
of, uh, jobs – handyman, but beyond handyman, if he had to, uh – he went back to college at 
Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. And, uh, he completed, uh, the other two years of 
his college degree, uh, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology.  
Well, in getting this degree, he had been, uh, told by a local white businessman who was 
on the board of trustees at the college that he might have a chance at becoming the principal of 
the local black high school. Well, uh, that was just one member of the board. Uh, as it turned out 
later on, uh, there was one local Baptist minister who considered himself to be the sort of, uh, uh, 
highest echelon black in the community. Uh, this man did not have a baccalaureate degree. He 
was simply a minister who had been called by God. Uh, but he opposed my father getting the job 
as the principal of the school. By the way, it was one of the best things that ever happened to my 
dad because, uh, there was a lot of jealousy in the community and he would not have been able 
to be an effective principal because, uh, he would not have gotten any support from the white 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 7 of 63 
 
community and, uh, many of the black people would have also been very jealous of the fact that 
he had suddenly been able to propel himself into a place of authority and respect that they could 
not hope that they would, uh, be able to.  
So, uh, he, um, um, he quit being ah, a, um, um, a person who was working and paying 
his way through school. In fact, he used to come home in the evening from school and he would 
say, “Let’s get organized.” And “Let’s get organized” meant that we all got in the, uh, car. Now 
we used the car as one would use a truck much to my mother’s chagrin, but my father was too 
poor to buy a truck. So I remember one of the earliest cars was a 1939 Buick and, uh, he would 
load that ’39 Buick with, uh, bricks and blocks and mortar and so forth so he could go do the job, 
so he could take care of his family and he could also, uh, find some money to pay the tuition to, 
uh, go to school.  
Well, uh, at some point, uh, we were getting to close to, uh, finishing high school and, uh, 
there was never any question that we were going to go to college. The question was where and 
how are we going to, uh, pay for going, uh, to, uh, college. So, uh, my dad, uh, took one of the 
gifts that he had in the, uh, construction trades industry, which was brick masonry, and he 
became a brick mason. And as a brick mason, he would travel to jobs all over that area or region 
of, uh, South Carolina in the Charlotte, uh, Columbia, Orangeburg, all that, anyplace you could 
drive to. Well, I was going to say anyplace you could drive to in a day. Actually I remember 
once we worked down at the, uh, Paris Island Marine Base in, uh, Beaufort, South Carolina, and 
in that case, we had to go and stay for five days and then, uh, come back home.  
But being a brick mason – brick masons, uh, earned a very, uh, nice wage, uh, and that’s 
what enabled us to find the money to go to school. The problem, however, was that brick 
masonry was reliable [15:00] only when, uh, the weather was, uh, good. If the weather was not 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 8 of 63 
 
good, you couldn’t lay bricks. And in the South, that meant that there were at least two or three 
months there when it was too cold, but as, uh, things would have it favoring my dad and my 
family, he got to the point of being in a typical instance among the masons employed on a 
particular job. He got to be, uh, sort of the master mason. So when all of the other masons had 
been dispatched from the job because the job was complete, my dad was the person who stayed 
around to put up a wall where they needed. So he would very often work through the entire 
winter and they had one laborer who worked with, uh, him and, uh, that is how we were able to 
get the funds to go to school. 
Now it turns out that I was the valedictorian of my class and my brother was the 
salutatorian of the class, and we jointly decided that we would go to Claflin College, now Claflin 
University in Orangeburg, South Carolina. My scholarship was seventy-five dollars per year. My 
brother’s scholarship as salutatorian of the class was fifty dollars per year. So that’s what got us 
started, uh, in education, but education was always emphasized in my home. Even though we 
were too poor to have a library, anything that we could find, we would, uh, read it and we would 
try to discuss it and try to, uh, grow from it. So all the while this is going on, my mother was 
essentially, uh, taking care of, of the family. [chimes ringing] She was, uh, very strong in her 
insistence that we not get involved in things that took us off the path to going to college and to 
getting, getting an education.  
JM: Can you pause for just a sec. That’s a chime from –  
JB: [brief remark about the chime]  
JM: In the house. 
TG: Ah yes, my – 
[Recording stops and then resumes]  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 9 of 63 
 
JM: Microscope through the Hubble Telescope. 
[Laughter]  
JB: Okay, we’re back. 
JM: Okay, we’re back after a short break. Um, Dr. Gaither, let me, you, you were talking 
about your, your, um, move towards Claflin, but I want to ask a, a couple more things about your 
family coming up.  
 
TG: Sure. 
JM: Um, obviously your, your, your father and through your father, your family had these 
direct and not so uncommon experiences obviously in terms of, um suffering for the, the slightest 
gesture of self-assertion –  
TG: Mm-hmm. 
JM: Yeah. Um, would, would conversations about race and race relations have been, 
have been open in your household? Were those things around the dinner table? Did you, say the 
Brown [Brown v. Board of Education] decision or Emmitt Till, are those kinds of things that 
would have been engaged conversationally by your family? 
TG: Those were discussed around the, uh, dinner table and my parents shared liberally 
with what their thoughts were on these kinds of, uh, things. Um, I especially remember the, uh, 
Till case, uh, utterings by my dad and, uh, absolute shame and horror of what had happened to 
this, uh, young man. In fact, I think it was conversations about Till that lodged in my psyche as 
one of the motivating factors for participating in the movement later on. Uh, Till would have 
been 1955. That’s about the same time as the Montgomery Bus Boycott. So there were these 
cumulative things happening out there that were being internalized.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 10 of 63 
 
Um, among the other things that, um, my dad was a part of, periodically at the cotton 
mills, there would be an effort to organize the workers, which meant that a union organizer 
would come in, and my dad was always the person who hosted the union organizer. So that was 
one of the other factors that would have caused him to lose his job. Uh, the union organizers 
often tried to keep a secret of where they stayed, but of course, somebody would know and 
somebody would go and tell the big boss man and, uh, that would be to your detriment if you 
happened to be the person.  
Uh, my parents were also, uh, openly supportive of the NAACP. Uh, I remember when I 
was, uh, quite a youngster, uh, probably less than ten years old. We used to go to meetings of the 
state conference of the NAACP when my dad would stand as we were going into the auditorium 
and, uh, there’d often be a whole bunch of adults in the, uh, lobby and he would hold me up for 
awhile so I could get some air and put me down and then take my brother and hold him up. Uh, 
but we were very supportive of the NAACP. [20:00] Now it was also, uh, uh, a negative if you 
were known to be an NAACP member and supportive of the NAACP. But despite that fact, uh, 
my dad was, was still a supporter and my mom.  
Uh, I remember that, uh, at some point, there was a suit by the South Carolina conference 
of the NAACP to equalize teachers’ salaries and speaking of a family dynamic, my mom and dad 
were both in favor of the NAACP suit to equalize teaching salaries, but I had two aunts who 
were also teachers who were not. They thought the NAACP was stirring up something that was 
best left alone and so I remember the, uh, sort of tug of war arguments that went on between, uh, 
them. And at that time, teachers’ salaries in South Carolina for blacks were very, very poor, and 
you had to take the National Teachers Exam. So if you took the National Teachers Exam and you 
earned an A, in addition to your base salary, you’d get a particular monthly supplement, a B, C. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 11 of 63 
 
Well, all of the school districts with a tax base would hire off all of the A people and the B 
people. So it would mean that a little town like Great Falls, the best it could hope for would be to 
get the C people, which meant that, uh, our teachers were not the best, but they did their best by 
us with what they had been able to amass and accumulate as, as, as knowledge.  
JM: Yeah. 
TG: I don’t know whether that’s the kind of response that you were looking for. 
JM: Oh no, it’s, it’s, very much, yeah, and we have plenty of time. 
TG: Okay, okay. 
JM: Um, were your parents able to register to vote or no? 
TG: Uh, my parents were registered voters. Uh, to register to vote and I should, I, I have 
the, uh, form that I filled, that I received when I became a qualified elector, a voter in South 
Carolina. You had to be eighteen years old, but I remember registering to vote. Yeah, my parents 
registered to vote, um, and they typically voted in, uh, elections. Uh, I was so, um, uh, involved 
in making sure that I voted until the first time I was eligible to vote after registering, I remember, 
um, a three-hundred-mile trip, a hundred and fifty miles one way to vote, a hundred and fifty 
miles back, and I have tried to point that out to my students that we shouldn’t be casual about our 
input into the political process. I vote almost every election. Even when I’ve been on leave, I find 
how long you have to be in the state in order to, uh, vote and register. I remember voting in 
California a couple of times when I was on sabbatical leave. 
JM: Right, right. 
TG: Yes. My, both of my parents were qualified electors. The, the, little thing I was 
talking about that, uh, you have to present saying that you are a qualified elector, you had to read 
a section of the South Carolina Constitution and interpret it to the satisfaction of the registrar. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 12 of 63 
 
But on there is that, “I do hereby swear that I am not a pauper supported at public expense. I 
have not been convicted of any of the following crimes: uh, stealing chickens, wife beating,” you 
know, all the kinds of things that [laughs] poor black people might have been involved in, uh, uh, 
public drunkenness and all of those kinds of things. And that’s on the certificate that I have. It 
probably is not the case, at least I hope it’s not the case now, that Winnsboro and, um, uh, 
Fairfield Counties moved beyond that. But there were all the disqualifiers, which is somewhat 
interesting because we’ve had this recent resurgence of requiring voter ID cards and all of that 
kind of thing, paying poll tax, which is a throwback to the same thing. It’s a way of disqualifying 
those whose input into the political process might be at odds with those who control the political 
process. 
JM: A whole half-century later. 
TG: Yes. 
JM: That’s right, that’s right. 
TG: So the greater distance we think we’ve come, [laughs], the more we look around, 
we’re in the same place.  
JM: Yeah. Tell me about Orangeburg when you arrived in ‘56 and what you, what you 
thought would be your course through college. 
TG: Well, I expected that, uh, with the high school background that I had, that I would 
have to work hard, uh, because, uh, I would be competing with some people who had had, even 
though, uh, all the students at Claflin at the time were, uh, black, people who’d had better 
backgrounds, uh, the people who had gone, for example, to C. A. Johnson [High School] in 
Columbia or some of the large, some of the high schools in the larger communities. [25:00] 
There were some of those people, uh, at Claflin. Uh, I found myself as, uh, the, my – I haven’t 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 13 of 63 
 
told you this yet, but since my mother was our early teacher and we did not have daycare, my 
brother, uh, right next to me about a, uh, year and a half to two years younger and I wound up 
being in the same graduating class. That’s how I was the valedictorian and he was the 
salutatorian because we couldn’t find anybody to keep him. So my mother took him to school 
and it turned out he was very bright and, uh, you know, didn’t miss a beat in terms of handling 
the academic information that was, uh, put before him. Uh, I remember, uh, uh, finding it, it an 
adjustment to, to be at, uh, Claflin, but, uh, managing to, uh, to stay above board, uh, 
academically. I graduated from Claflin, uh, indeed, uh, with honors with a, uh, B.S. degree in, 
uh, general science with a concentration in biology. 
JM: Tell me about the, um, tell me about how race entered into your college experience 
in, in, in Orangeburg and I know, of course, that South Carolina State is there as well and the 
community will become a place that, um, under, in large measure because of your efforts that 
would in 1960, in the spring of ‘60, become very active. But there is a, there is a story before 
that. 
TG: Well, the only choice of going to a college at that time would have been a, a black 
college. Uh, the closest two black colleges would have been Allen University in Columbia and 
Benedict College in Columbia. Not too far away was Morris College. Benedict and Morris are 
Baptist schools. Allen is an A.M.E. school. And, uh, we didn’t, based on the reputation of those, 
uh, colleges, gravitate towards them or choose them. Claflin was a choice that I agreed upon and 
my brother was, uh, pleased with. So that’s, so we had no choice of, uh, of, uh, of colleges, uh, 
on a racial basis.  
Let me tell you this little story because I, it, it jumps ahead, but it’s, it’s apropos. Uh, I 
remember visiting my father in the, uh, ‘70s and ‘80s and, uh, he had this, uh, Clemson College 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 14 of 63 
 
logo around and I said, “What goes with, with Clemson College?” And, uh, he had chosen to 
root for Clemson College because of an incident that occurred with me when I was at Claflin. 
When I was at Claflin my senior year, I sent, uh, money to the Educational Testing Service in 
Princeton, New Jersey, to take the Graduate Record Exam. So there were about a dozen black 
students from South Carolina State and Claflin who were, uh, to take the Graduate Record Exam 
at the University of South Carolina. Well, we were told to go to an auditorium on campus. When 
we arrived, we were intercepted by a professor who said, “We cannot permit you to take the 
GRE, uh, on the campus of the University of South Carolina. You people will have to go off 
campus.”  
And so across the, uh, street, I want to say it was Bull Street. I’m not sure that was the 
name of the street at the time. There was a two-story building. The, uh, second story of the, uh, 
building was just an open room with some chairs and, uh, this is no exaggeration, the 
temperature in that room must have been eighty-five or ninety degrees. And that is where we 
were forced to take the Graduate Record Exam, an exam that determines all of your possibilities 
for the future and these were the conditions or the circumstances under which we were required 
to take the exam.  
Well, I had told my dad that when I came home, uh, to visit him. I went home to visit him 
after that, uh, event and he had stored that away in his mind that he would never root for the 
University of South Carolina, but he would root for Clemson. Now at the time, Clemson was not 
a university. Clemson started out as an agricultural experiment station. It later became a 
university, but it was the school in South Carolina that he could identify with because he refused 
to identify with the University of South Carolina.  
JM: Right, yeah. You got drawn, uh, into, into, uh, college leadership roles. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 15 of 63 
 
TG: Um, yes. Uh, I was the president [30:00] of the youth chapter of the Claflin College 
chapter of the NAACP.  
JM: Starting what year of college? 
TG: Um, let’s see, I know as, as, as a junior.  
JM: Okay, yeah. 
TG: Uh, and that is how I gravitated into the sit-ins because it was the natural position 
from which one might assume a role in, in leadership. 
JM: Tell me about – 
JB: Let’s break – 
JM: Okay, yeah. 
JB: For a second and then, um, start a new file. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
 
JB: Okay. 
 
JM: Dr. Gaither, let me have you, let me have you describe the youth chapter of the, the 
NAACP in, in, on the campus then and how it connected you to the state NAACP apparatus and 
how it then led you forward. 
 
TG: Okay. Um, the first year I was president of the campus chapter, I would say maybe 
out of, uh, two hundred students, we may have had twenty-five or thirty people who were 
members. Once –  
 
JM: Out of how many? Sorry, I’m sorry. How many students? 
 
TG: Uh, it was, I think it was less than two hundred. It wasn’t a very large university. We 
knew every –. If you were a student, you would know everyone on campus. You would know 
which year they were in and you would also know their hometowns and all of that. It was a very 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 16 of 63 
 
small, very closely-knit community. Now after the sit-ins started, almost everyone on campus 
joined the NAACP chapter. There were a couple of, uh, young people or students there who were 
afraid to join because they thought that word of their joining as youth members of a college 
chapter of the NAACP might get back to their communities and there would be reprisals against 
their parents. And I can remember a couple of those people actually coming and apologizing to 
me that they could not be members of the youth chapter of the NAACP.  
Now as a youth chapter NAACP president, uh, I was permitted to, uh, attend regional 
meetings of the, uh, NAACP. That is where I would have met first people like, uh, Ruby Hurley 
or, uh, Amos Brown or Medgar Evers. Uh, there were people there from South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Mississippi, not Alabama. Alabama at the time, the NAACP was, uh, illegal. So we 
didn’t have anybody slipping through, uh, who were, uh, parts of the, uh, Alabama civil rights, 
uh, scene.  
Uh, so when the sit-ins started in Greensboro, North Carolina – February first, 1960 – the 
first sit-ins in South Carolina were at Rock Hill, and as soon as we heard about that, we said, 
“The same problems that are being addressed in North Carolina and north of here in Rock Hill 
are here. So we’ve got to organize too.” And that’s where we sort of expanded out from this 
NAACP youth chapter to, uh, organizing and participating, uh, in the, uh, sit-ins. Um, yeah, 
maybe that’s –  
 
JM: Tell me, tell me about the process that you undertook then to bring the campus, to 
bring the campus chapter and, and the wider campus forward into active – 
 
TG: Well, it wasn’t just the wider Claflin campus. It was also the South Carolina State, 
uh, students that we would have to engage. Well, first of all, we didn’t know the first thing about 
nonviolence or how to organize a sit-in. So we were fortunately visited by or someone had sent a 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 17 of 63 
 
man named James T. McCain, who was from Sumter, South Carolina, and he worked for an 
organization called the Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE. And CORE had a little thing that 
was called CORE Rules for Action. There was also a little booklet called “Cracking the Color 
Line” by James Peck and so those were the very first kinds of sources that we were privy to, to 
form the philosophical backlog for the organization of the sit-ins. The Orangeburg sit-ins were 
actually organized by a group of students from South Carolina State and Claflin and we met in 
the old J. J. Seabrook’s, uh, auditorium or actually gymnasium on the campus of, uh, Claflin. 
And so with these pamphlets and so forth and with, uh, the inspiration of Dr. King’s book, Stride 
Toward Freedom, we started putting together socio-dramas of situations that might be faced if 
we were doing [35:00] a sitting, sit-in, or if we were picketing. So that’s sort of how we got, got 
going.  
 
Now the South Carolina, uh, State students, to my knowledge, did not have a youth 
chapter of the NAACP, but they were right there with us as, as we organized. So we actually 
started sort of a, uh, local student movement association with one person from Claflin – that was 
me – and one person from South Carolina State. I’m not absolutely certain, but the person from 
South Carolina State may have been Chuck McDew. Chuck McDew was there very early on. So 
what we did, uh, with a little bit more knowledge of, uh, what sit-ins were about and what the 
philosophy was, was to train a group of about, uh, a dozen or so sort of secondary student, uh, 
leaders. These would be the people who would be involved in helping to organize and 
communicate the philosophy and the modus operandi for Claflin but would also do the same 
kind for State. Now I think that one of the persons in that group may have been Jim Clyburn. 
JM: Sure, sure. 
TG: Uh, the current, uh, House of Representatives person from South Carolina. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 18 of 63 
 
JM: Sure. 
TG: So Clyburn was involved, uh, very early on. 
JM: Let’s pause just for a second and have you, I think there’s probably an important 
point to be made about the fact that Claflin is private and, and State, yeah. 
TG: That is –  
JM: And, and how that rippled through these issues. 
TG: That, that is, uh, that is, you’re absolutely correct because, uh, I think there may have 
even been for, uh, activities of a similar nature some expulsions from South Carolina State, 
because at the time, the persons who were chosen to be the administrators of predominately 
black state schools were often chosen because of their ability to suppress student uprisings, 
whatever their nature if the nature was in opposition to the existing status of maintaining 
segregation and so forth and so on. So at Claflin, we could, we could organize. We had the 
freedom to do so. Uh, there was, uh, in the initial groups, uh, a disproportionate representation of 
guys, because at the time, girls could be out of the dormitories only until seven o’clock or seven 
thirty. So we had to communicate what we had done to the, uh, to the girls, uh, because they 
couldn’t be there sitting, uh, uh, sitting with us. 
JM: Right, right. Tell me a little bit about, as, as much as you can conjure it and recall it 
from this distance, it must have been a, a, a wide range of emotions and a wide range of 
questions and a wide range of uncertainties that were, that, that, that you would have had at a 
time trying to launch into something as complex and prospectively, uh, difficult as, as organizing 
in Orangeburg.  
TG: Uh, we were, uh, idealists. Uh, we were, uh, in many instances, uh, quite, uh, 
enamored with the possibilities for using nonviolence as a strategy for promoting, uh, social 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 19 of 63 
 
change. Uh, we were, of course, fearful of our safety. We were fearful of the reprisals that might 
be levied at our parents, but we also realized that if we didn’t move, we were going to, uh, stay in 
the same circumstance. So that was a motivating factor that the students have moved in North 
Carolina, they’ve moved in Rock Hill. We have to move in, uh, in Orangeburg. So that, despite 
the, uh, potential, uh, pitfalls, uh, was a compelling and a motivating force for us.  
Now I should say that this was done almost exclusively by students. Uh, there was no, 
there was a very, uh, good local relationship with the adult NAACP, but we really didn’t go to 
the, the president of the Orangeburg chapter of the NAACP saying, “We want to organize sit-
ins,” because the NAACP’s approach to this whole problem was fundamentally different from 
the approach that we were interested in. We were interested in nonviolent direct action. We were 
not interested in having one student arrested and then having that person, uh, be a test case and 
getting a court ruling that at some point would say, “Well, you guys can go sit at the lunch 
counter.”  
I happen to think that a large part of the strength and reserve of my generation at least, 
uh, the passion for our involvement [40:00] was the active participation and the suffering that we 
endured. That’s very different than if you file a suit and you sit and somebody says, “Well, you 
can go sit at the lunch counter tomorrow.” This is that same question I was making, or comment 
I was making about being compelled to go and vote or feeling an obligation to go and vote. 
That’s different and, uh, that’s, I think, one of the, uh, positive attributes at the personal level for, 
uh, those who participated in the sit-ins. The day in Orangeburg when we had a mass arrest, uh, 
three hundred and fifty people arrested. 
 
JM: In March, I think the fifteenth of March. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 20 of 63 
 
 
TG: The fifteenth of March, yes. Uh, city jail filled, county jail filled, open air stockade. 
The president of the Claflin chapter of the NAACP was in Columbia, and we had not even told 
him, not that I think he would have had objected one iota, but this was our movement, this was 
our time to move, and we didn’t want any tempering from anybody about, “Well, don’t do this. 
Wait ‘til tomorrow to do this,” that kind of thing. We felt that our elders had had their 
opportunity [laughs]. They had sat on it. We were not going to be, uh, similarly, uh, situated. So 
we reasoned that if we move, there’s no choice. I mean, you’ve got three hundred and fifty 
peace-loving young people who have behaved in a nonviolent manner. They have been arrested. 
What are the adults going to do? There’s nothing. They, they’d be forced to be supportive of us, 
and that was the way we reasoned it. [laughs] 
 
JM: How’d you feel at the end of that day? 
 
TG: [sighs] Well, it was [laughs] an, an interesting, uh, day to say the least. By the way, 
uh, I, I was not arrested on that day for sitting in. Um, eventually, uh, they had students in the 
county courthouse where they were arraigning them or deciding, uh, booking them, uh, I’m sure, 
because there were so many people that they had to deal with and, uh, I was standing outside 
talking to Herbert Wright, the national NAACP youth secretary and, uh, the policeman came 
over and said, “You have to move. You can’t stand here and talk.” And I said, uh, well, I started 
walking around. The, uh, courthouse is in a square, and the sidewalk is around the perimeter. 
Well, after I went around one time, they took me out [laughs] and arrested me anyway and, uh, I 
was also charged with, uh, with breaching the peace, uh, and, uh, disturbing the peace. Uh, uh, at 
the end of that day, um, just an enormous, uh, number of people, uh, arrested and, uh, involved.  
I remember that we met back up at the, um, gymnasium on the campus of Claflin College 
and that was the first time that I remember meeting, um, Matthew Perry, who just died, uh, 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 21 of 63 
 
recently. Uh, I remember how gracious he was in, uh, telling us, uh, that we would be, uh, 
defended. Uh, the NAACP would use its resources for our defense. In fact, he was so gracious 
that I started to think, “Well, maybe we’ve won something here.” It, it was the just the tone of 
his, his, his voice. Uh, but we felt good to have contributed that one little skirmish in an 
enormous-sized battle for, uh, for equal rights. It was just simply the right to sit at a lunch 
counter and eat a hamburger in dignity like any other American. 
JM: Let me ask you about a couple things, um, in, in the, in the run-up to that day. When 
you first encountered the philosophy of nonviolent direct action, it seems that it resonated with 
you, I take, and I’m, I’m – 
TG: [laughs] 
JM: Curious about having you talk about that a little bit, if that did or did not in important 
ways connect to your personal faith through the church. I’m interested in those things and then 
I’ll –  
TG: It ultimately did, but it did not initially. Uh, the first time I heard someone talk about 
nonviolence was a man by the name of Glenn Smiley, who worked for the Fellowship of 
Reconciliation. He gave a lecture at, uh, Claflin talking about nonviolence and I remember 
standing up and saying, “That is what is wrong with black people. We have been, uh, we have 
not, we’ve been too, we’ve been nonviolent too long.” But that was my naiveté. Uh, sitting and 
accepting something, [45:00] uh, that is demeaning or demoralizing is not nonviolence, but that 
shows you where I was [laughs] in terms of my comprehension of nonviolence. So I actually 
started to embrace the philosophy when I started to learn something about its tactics and 
techniques from this man, uh, Jim McCain.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 22 of 63 
 
JM: Yeah, tell, and I wanted, that was my next question. I want to ask, I want to have you 
describe James McCain.  
TG: Uh, one of the, uh, most important people in the civil rights struggle, um, for South 
Carolina especially because that was his home, his home state, uh, a very low-key man, uh, a 
person whose primary commitment was to the cause, not to any kind of personal advancement 
that it, uh, would bring him. Uh, he was tactically a nonviolent person. If you wanted to go into 
the real substance and philosophy of nonviolence, uh, you’d have to, uh, read, uh, Homer Jack’s 
autobiography or, or Gandhi by Louis Fischer or something of that sort, which I, which I later 
read and, uh, which I found to be remarkably instructive about, uh, how Gandhi connected his, 
um, uh, how, how Gandhi, uh, staged his, uh, battle against, uh, the British for Indian 
independence using nonviolence. 
JM: Um, tell me more about McCain.  
TG: About what? 
JM: Tell me a little bit more about, about Mr. McCain. Are there – 
TG: Uh. 
JM: And, and maybe your, the nature of your evolving relationship with him.  
TG: Well, I would consider Jim McCain to have been my mentor, uh, in the, uh, Civil 
Rights Movement. Uh, he was, uh, interested in me as a person and also as one who would be a 
participant in the, uh, movement and in fact, he was the person who, uh, persuaded me to attend 
a, uh, session held by CORE. This would have been in the, uh, summer, I believe, of 1960. 
CORE held at, um, Miami what was called an Action Institute, and at this Action Institute, uh, all 
of the, uh, upper echelon of CORE and a large number of, uh, students, uh, from the New 
Orleans, uh, area especially, uh, we were there to learn about how to stage, uh, sit-ins and so 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 23 of 63 
 
forth. In fact, that was the second time I was arrested because, uh, I was sitting at a table in a 
little community that is called Hollywood, California – 
JM: Florida. 
TG: Hollywood, yeah. 
JM: Excuse me. 
JM: Hollywood, Florida. Yes, you’re, you’re exactly correct, Hollywood, Florida, with a 
girl from New York, uh, named Dottie Miller. Dottie later was, was for a short time married to 
Bob Zellner. Bob Zellner may be the, the person who’s, who’s better known in terms of, uh, uh, 
participation in the civil rights. But we’re playing this game, uh, where you’d say, “I’m thinking 
of somebody,” and you have a whole bunch of clues and you finally say who the person is. And, 
uh, the management of this restaurant decided that they, uh, didn’t want us in their restaurant. So 
we were arrested, Dottie Miller and this whole, uh, group and, uh, we spent ten or twelve days in 
the Dade County jail. Bernard Lafayette was, uh, among the other persons that, uh, one would 
identify with who were parts of this group. And we had the most interesting charge I’ve ever 
heard. The charge was ejection of undesirable guests, ejection of undesirable guests. When it 
came before the judge, the judge said, “No adjudication, but if you guys stay down here, and if 
you are involved in similar activities, I reserve the right, uh,  I’ll put you on probation and if 
you’re on probation, then, uh, you could wind up back in, in jail again.” 
JM: I’m not even sure I understand what that charge means. 
TG: [laughs] I don’t understand either.  
JM: Okay. 
TG: That was the charge, ejection of undesirable guests. It wasn’t trespassing. It wasn’t 
breaching the peace. That was the charge.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 24 of 63 
 
JM: Let me, you, you mentioned, this is in Miami and, and I think that Miami meeting, if 
my dates are right, was August 1960. 
TG: Okay. 
JM: So you would have graduated the prior May. 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
JM: Were you already on staff as a field secretary or had that not happened yet? 
TG: No, that had not happened yet. 
JM: Okay. 
TG: Right after I graduated, I worked in South Carolina, uh, with a man named, uh, 
Frank Robinson who was, he was associated with, uh, CORE. [50:00] Uh, Frank Robinson, uh, 
was from Sumter, South Carolina, and Jim McCain. I was working with a group of about, uh, 
four or five people and we were doing voter registration in South Carolina. So we would, uh, go 
to churches in the evenings and we’d talk about the importance of registering and voting and, uh, 
that, uh, kind of, uh, thing. Uh, yeah, and that’s, I went from there – 
JM: Okay. 
TG: To the Action Institute and then I was hired on – 
JM: Yes. 
TG: Uh, by CORE. 
JM: Let, let me bring in some more threads here. There are many threads. So, uh, forgive 
me if I, if I keep – 
TG: [laughs] 
JM: Wind up the clock back to bring in another theme. 
TG: That’s okay.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 25 of 63 
 
JM: Because there are so many things here. Um, on the nonviolence question again, so 
initially you, you, you told that very interesting story about your first on hearing this was 
skepticism and – 
TG: Yeah, sure. 
JM: And even contempt maybe. 
TG: Yeah. 
JM: If that’s fair to say. 
TG: Uh huh. 
JM: Um, did you, did you see its merits first in tactical terms or did you go all that 
distance to sort of internalizing it and being committed to it as a, as a, as a more encompassing 
philosophy? 
TG: No, I, I went to it in, in tactical terms. Uh, I think it takes a lot of discipline and study 
to go to nonviolence in the philosophical sense of, of, of Gandhi. Uh, in fact, there were times 
and, uh, this is jumping forward, there were times, uh, when we were, um, on the road gang in 
Rock Hill, when as the, uh, adult sort of in that group, uh, my mind was clicking in, “How would 
Gandhi behave in this situation?” And we often discussed the difference between tactical 
nonviolence and nonviolence as a more involved personal philosophy of, uh, life. Well, I knew 
how I thought Gandhi would have handled the situation. Gandhi would volunteer to clean the 
toilets, and I was not likely to be able to get my young colleagues to say, “This is what we should 
do.” There are practical limits sometimes. We were loading trucks with sand. You can throw 
only so many shovels in. But I, I happen to think that Gandhi would probably have thrown 
shovels until he collapsed. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 26 of 63 
 
And so there was always that sort of editing between the philosophy as a technique and 
the, uh, philosophy as a way of, a way of life. I think one gradually grows into it, the philosophy 
as a way of life, and I don’t think I have met a lot of people who have done that. There are some 
people whose knowledge of nonviolence is far superior to mine, whom I respect for their ability 
to connect all of this together in a life-encompassing philosophy rather than as a tactic or a 
technique for acquiring human rights or promoting issues of justice. 
JM: Along the way, say, coming through the spring semester of 1960 and into the early 
summer, you start this voter registration work. Um, what’s the reaction of your family? 
TG: Uh, my family was very supportive, uh, extremely, uh, supportive. Uh, I kept in 
contact, but, uh, my, my family was deeply religious, both my mom and my dad, and if you were 
asking them about their concern for me, they would probably say, “The Lord will take care of it 
and I just put that in the hands of the Lord.” Uh, that would have been their response and, uh, 
that’s truly the way, the way they felt. So even though they knew I was in danger, somehow they 
were optimistic that, uh, I would return with all of my, uh, senses and, uh, would not have been, 
uh, permanently impaired in, in any way. I’m not sure that they realized how dangerous it was, 
but you have to also realize that they were in danger too in a small community. Uh, and they 
were not nonviolent.  
Let me tell you [laughs] this story. Uh, when we were in jail in Rock Hill, some of the 
local people who had known my dad forever came to him and said, “We will protect you while 
your son is twenty-nine miles away on the road gang.” And, uh, I’m not sure what my dad told 
them, but I don’t think he encouraged them, because there was no one sitting in a car at the, uh, 
fence around my place to shoot someone who would come there, but while I was in jail in Rock 
Hill, uh, a cross was burned on the lawn of my, uh, parents’ house and I remember when my dad 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 27 of 63 
 
told me that, he said, “And if I had seen him,” he said, [55:00] “It would have been the last cross 
that he would have burned.” And it, it occurred to me that I wouldn’t think of shooting someone 
for burning a cross. That’s where I had grown in nonviolence. But my dad was a different 
generation, a whole different ethic about how you go about protecting your family. That’s one of 
the primary things that a man does who has a family.  
JM: Tell me about some of your, um, early – 
JB: Let’s pause for a second. 
JM: Okay, take a little break. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
 
JB: Okay. 
 
JM: We’re back after a short break. Dr. Gaither, let me ask you to talk a little bit about 
your, your emerging impressions of this organization called CORE. You’ve obviously met Mr. 
McCain through the spring. He becomes a very important mentor. You go into this voter 
registration effort. Are you getting much of a sense of CORE at the national level or how does 
your sense of that emerge? 
 
TG: Yes, uh, I was getting an impression of CORE at the, uh, at the national level 
because I had occasion to visit the CORE office in New York and at the time, the CORE office, 
uh, with the exception of Jim McCain, most of the staff was, uh, was white. Uh, Marvin Rich, 
Gordon Cary, and the executive secretary of CORE when I first learned about CORE was a very 
slightly built, uh, white man by the name of, uh, Jim Robinson, James Russell Robinson 
(laughs), a very nice person, uh, very committed to the cause. And CORE had actually, since its 
inception in 1942 at the University of Chicago, had been primarily a northern, um, organization 
composed of, uh, liberal people who, uh, believed that nonviolent direct action could be used to 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 28 of 63 
 
promote, uh, social change. So once I started going to the CORE national office, I started 
meeting, uh, other people and my impression of the possibilities for nonviolent direct action, and 
my respect for the commitment of the people involved, uh, was, was, uh, ever increasing.  
 
JM: Tell me about, I, I think it’s the case that your first trip, um, up to the office was as a 
consequence of the leadership role you had on, on the Claflin campus. 
 
TG: Oh yes, no question about it. 
 
JM: Tell, tell me about that, the invitation, the trip. Tell me about that. 
 
TG: Uh, well, it was the first time I had rode on an airplane. [laughs] And I remember 
going to the airport in Columbia and, uh, flying up to, uh, up to New York. Uh, the airport in 
Columbia was, by the way, very small then. There may have been, uh, eight or ten gates or so, 
rather unlike [laughs] the, the airport, uh, that is, uh, there now. Yeah, and I, I remember 
meeting, uh, Jimmy McDonald and, uh, Gordon Cary and, uh, Marvin Rich and so forth and 
being sort of shown a little bit of the big city, uh, never having been to a city, uh, like New York, 
uh, before, yeah.  
 
JM: Yeah, yeah. Um, through that summer and your voter registration work, what are the 
memories that, that emerge as, as, or most vividly for you about that, those few months? 
 
TG: I remember, uh, talking. See, what we did, we went individually and talked with 
people and often we chose to go to projects where there was a concentration of people, many of 
whom would have not been registered voters and we would actually try to, uh, engage people in 
conversations about the importance of voting. And it would always get down to this, especially 
with the little old ladies: “Um, I will go and register and vote if my preacher says it’s, it’s okay.” 
It was almost always that the minister had to give his blessings or you were not going to get them 
to. Now there were some people who would, uh, after you told them why it was important, 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 29 of 63 
 
would say, “Well, I’ll go down and I’ll, I’ll give it a try.” But I remember, uh, almost without 
fail, the people who were resistant, it was a matter of, uh, “If, if the minister, if my preacher says 
it’s okay, I, I may go give it a try.” I’m not sure how many of those people we ever really got to 
register and vote, but, uh, we did have some success and again, we chose projects and places 
where you could go from one door to the next to the next, and it was almost a one-on-one kind of 
thing with, with our team.  
 
JM: Um, through that summer in 1960, there is much, there is much, much active 
conversation and debate even, um, in the civil rights community, um, such as it was structured in 
its pieces and different parts in that, in that moment, um, [1:00:00] about how to move forward 
because obviously, the sit-ins oftentimes were met with, most oftentimes were met with very, 
very vigorous and ongoing resistance and yielded relatively little if anything in sort of terms of a 
direct result. So I’m wondering about, about your thoughts through that period because 
obviously, this is going to connect to the emergence of another idea about how to move forward, 
uh, that you will sort of play a very large part in helping to promulgate and, and, and, uh, 
advocate. 
  
TG: Well, the, um, early sit-ins, uh, essentially resulted in people sitting at lunch counters 
and being arrested and then posting bond and, uh, the bond was, uh, uh, used by the, uh, state to 
perhaps, uh, continue the practice and so, uh, I felt that there should be, uh, more perhaps of a 
commitment on our part being willing to suffer for something that we really wanted to, uh, to 
have happen. So that’s why a year almost to the date after the first sit-ins, we, uh, got involved in 
the “jail, no bail” policy with the Friendship Nine. That was deliberate and, uh, that protest was 
really to occur one year after the first sit-ins, and it was to take us to a different level of 
commitment and, uh, that’s the essence of the, uh, “jail, no bail.” Now there were quandaries 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 30 of 63 
 
about what had been happening previously, uh, in the people who were with the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. There were doubtlessly, uh, some NAACP chapters that 
had jumped on board and so forth who were dealing with the same thing. And so “jail, no bail” 
would turn out to be a, uh, an important, um, commitment level that we had not seen before, 
which we would hope would appeal to people of goodwill.  
Now these college students, who were just simply sitting at a lunch counter, they were 
arrested and they are in jail now or they’re on a road gang, uh, now. There’s something wrong 
with me and I’m, I’m, I’m talking about if someone were really interested in social justice or 
addressing the problems that we have in this country relative to race. So without doing anything 
active, at least the people in the other parts of the country could say, “Well, we’re not going to 
patronize that store” or “I’m going to, uh, insist, uh, in my own personal life that we find a way 
to, uh, treat those young people fairly.” So that willingness to suffering, uh, we had hoped that 
that would appeal to the good-natured, uh, sense of social justice that we hoped permeated 
enough people in the country for some positive change to occur. 
 
JM: Yeah. Let me reach back again for some of these threads that are bringing us forward 
here. So through, I think in the spring of, the spring of ‘60, in fact, a group of students who are 
CORE-affiliated at Florida A&M – 
 
TG: Oh yeah.  
 
JM: Get arrested and they serve sixty days. 
 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
 
JM: Now you would have known about that, I gather. 
 
TG: Yes, yes.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 31 of 63 
 
 
JM: And that, that is generally emerging, I mean generally cited in the literature as sort of 
a first instance of a kind of “jail, no bail.” 
 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
 
JM: Um, the – 
 
TG: May I interrupt a moment here? 
 
JM: Please, please. 
 
TG: Uh, sometimes I, I think the important thing is not perhaps what you do, but the 
context that you do it in and, uh, I would never detract one iota from the significance of what 
happened to this CORE group in Tallahassee, Pat [Patricia] Stephens, Priscilla Stephens, and, 
and, and, uh, those people, but outside of CORE echelons, I’m not sure how well that particular 
protest was known. 
 
JM: Exactly. 
 
TG: But I think we had had hundreds of students arrested, uh, in the early, in the early 
1960s, uh, after the, the sit-in movement started up in, uh, Greensboro. And we, we had a context 
for the Friendship Nine, and I think it was being in the strategic place at the strategic time and it 
still merits a significant note historically because there were certainly other groups that could 
have done the same thing, but ours was the group that did the critical thing. 
 
JM: I’m, I’m absolutely of that view, absolutely. [1:05:00] I’m, I’m trying to trace kind 
of how you, because you go to Miami in August of ‘60 and earlier in recounting that arrest there, 
you made it seem and, and I want to, I want to make sure I’m, I’m clear on this, the arrest there 
was intentional or kind of surprised you in a – 
 
TG: Well, it, this was an Action Institute. 
 
JM: Yeah. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 32 of 63 
 
 
TG: And in the Action Institute, we would very often have, uh, for example, we would 
have a white and a black sitting at a lunch counter, and we would have observers that were white 
and black, and we were trying to sense the sentiment of, or the position of the management. And 
so if the white and black who were the test group were served, then the white or the black who 
were the observers would say, “Well, I’m going to not patronize this place anymore. You’re 
letting a black person eat down at the end of the counter.” So you have no way, when you go in 
to do that, you have no way of knowing how the police are going to perceive it. They might just 
come in and arrest both of the groups, and so the arrest in Miami was really sort of accidental. 
We were not planning to be arrested, but we realized that we might be arrested. And in fact, in 
some of the proceedings of the Action Institute, there were some people whose level of 
commitment to what we were doing was not quite up to the level of being arrested, they wound 
up being arrested and they actually were, uh, uh, somewhat, uh, sore about the fact that they were 
arrested. But you had to realize that if you were in this particular game, that was all a part of the 
territory.  
 
JM: You spent time, as you mentioned, in the Dade County Jail. 
 
TG: Yes. 
 
JM: That would have been your first extended stay. 
 
TG: Yes, yes, not a, not a nice place to spend time at all. Um, we were in a, uh, cell block 
that may have had thirty-five men or so, including murderers. Um, for the most part, the 
prisoners were very respectful, uh, to us, but to anybody else who came in the, uh, cell block, uh, 
there were certain, uh, expectations that were enforced by the cell block person who was at the 
top of the hierarchy and by that, I mean the person who was the strongest and who wielded 
enough power to make other underlings carry out his orders. I remember one night, uh, an 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 33 of 63 
 
elderly man was put into the cell block and, uh, one of the, uh, underlings, uh, went over to him 
and said, “Uh, Pops, you have to take a shower.” And, uh, this man said, “Well, who the hell do 
you think you are? I’m, I’m not taking a shower. I just got arrested for being drunk out on the 
streets. I’m clean.” And he said, uh, the underling went back and told the, the guy who was the 
sort of head of the cell block and he said, “Well, either he takes a shower now or I’m going to 
beat the hell out of you.” And so this underling goes back and tells the man, “You’ve got to take 
a shower.” And he gave him the same argument before and, uh, within a matter of moments, this 
guy’s being beaten by this underling and he’s thrown into the shower and he takes a shower. So 
it was that sort of, uh, environment, not a good environment at all [laughs].  
The first time I saw guys, uh, make, uh, hot chocolate, uh, in a cell block and, uh, there 
were these metal cups. Uh, and, uh, they would take a Mars candy bar or a Milky Way and they 
would put it right up next to the incandescent lamp or light. They could find enough to attach it 
there and the chocolate would melt into the water, stir it around, and that was hot chocolate. 
[laughs] 
 
JM: Um, when, when, uh, CORE invites you to become a field secretary, right, kind of on 
the other side of the Miami, uh, experience, what, what was your thought about that opportunity 
and, and what you might be doing and – 
 
TG: I was delighted at the opportunity to be able to go, uh, and work full time, uh, in the, 
uh, in the movement. Um, my background had been, uh, in the NAACP, of, uh, course, but I did 
not agree with the philosophy of the NAACP in terms of about, of how you go about promoting 
social change, um, but I was pleased that I had the contacts with the NAACP. So when I went to 
Jackson, Mississippi, to work, uh, the only person that I really knew in Jackson was Medgar 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 34 of 63 
 
Evers and I had met Medgar Evers at these regional meetings [70:00] of the NAACP when I was 
a student at Claflin. 
 
JM: So you actually went immediately then to Mississippi in ‘60 or in South Carolina? 
 
TG: Uh, no, no, I had a, I had a variety of assignments for CORE. 
 
JM: Okay. 
 
TG: Uh, I remember working in Kentucky. Uh, I remember working in California. I 
remember working in Arizona. Wherever there were – people would, would write CORE and 
they would express an interest in addressing a problem of discrimination in their communities 
where nonviolent direct action could be used. And, uh, CORE would then send out a person to 
train them, to advise them, so forth and so on. So that’s how I got to work in some of these, uh, 
these other communities. 
 
JM: Right. 
 
TG: No, I got the Jackson assignment because I had been key in coming up with the idea 
of a Freedom Ride in the first place and because I had made all of these contacts along the route, 
that made it sort of a natural kind of thing for me to be the scout for the ride. 
 
JM: Right. It, it’s just amazing to me as we go through this conversation, you’re so thick 
in so much of this history that, that every time I, every, there’s just more and more and more. 
 
TG: [laughs] 
 
JM: So I have to slow you down again because we certainly will come on the Freedom 
Rides, um, here pretty soon, but, but through the fall of 1960, one of the things then that you’re 
very heavily involved with is beginning to do the training with the folks from Rock Hill. 
 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 35 of 63 
 
 
JM: And can you describe that because that’s going to obviously build up to January 
thirty-one? 
 
TG: Okay, um, the training with the folks from Rock Hill was done at Claflin College 
and I think that Gordon Cary was there and, uh, Jim McCain may have been in and out of, uh, 
there and the primary emphasis was on the socio-dramas. The amazing thing about the 
Friendship Nine was that we took essentially a group of college students who had no knowledge 
at all of tactical nonviolence and we pulled off one of the most important protest, uh, events of 
the movement. I mean, I, I look back at that now. Normally, to do this kind of thing, if you 
expect people to be arrested and to spend thirty days on a road gang, you go find some guys 
who’ve studied nonviolence and who have been involved in protests like we did for the Freedom 
Rides. The first riders were not randomly chosen people. They were people, you had to submit 
an application. Everybody had to feel comfortable with everybody else in terms of their ability to 
behave in a nonviolent way or fashion. That’s not what we had with the Friendship Nine, but we 
were able to pull it off. 
 
JM: Yeah. 
 
TG: Great.  
[Laughter] 
 
TG: Because those, those are really a great bunch of guys. 
 
JM: Yeah. 
 
TG: Yeah. 
 
JM: One, one question I’m curious about: why, why January thirty-one and not February 
one? Why didn’t you wait one more day? 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 36 of 63 
 
 
TG: Well, uh, there were, the students were, um, uh, interested in being able to register 
for the next semester of classes and so our, uh, choice of the date that wasn’t exactly opposite the 
starting date of February first, uh, 1960, February first, 1961, was to accommodate that. So the 
guys could get registered [chimes in background] so that if things went well and they spent their 
thirty days, they might be able to be in enough contact with their teachers to not lose a whole 
semester of, of schooling. So that’s the reason for that. 
 
JM: Let’s pause for just a sec. 
 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
 
TG: Yeah, so that the – 
 
JM: Okay. We’re back on, yeah. 
 
TG: So that the Friendship, uh, college students could register and, uh, have the potential 
for completing a semester, uh, even though they were going to be on the road gang in Rock Hill. 
Uh, we decided to have them do that on the, we decided to have the arrest on the thirty-first 
where they could accomplish that rather than putting it so that it was February first anniversary. 
February, uh, first, 1960, was the original date; ‘61 would have been the anniversary date.  
 
JM: Yeah, forgive me. I’m, I’m not, I’m missing the point. The one day difference 
mattered because of a date you had to go register on the college? 
 
TG: The, the students had to register at the college. 
 
JM: Okay, okay, gotcha. 
 
TG: So that they could, uh, stand the possibility of, uh, of, of not losing a whole semester.  
 
JM: Got it, got it, right. Um, there’s much, I’m sure, to, to say [1:15:00] about the 
experience of being, uh, on the road gang. 
 
TG: Oh yes. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 37 of 63 
 
 
JM: And you’ve written beautifully about that and at some length really detailing your 
experience there. Um, so just for sake of time, I, obviously I’d be very interested if you wanted 
to share any thoughts or perspective on that, but I want too to ask about, um, it seems that 
already you are, you personally are extremely alert to what this might mean in the moment to the 
wider movement, to, to the fortunes, the prospects of the wider movement. You make a call to 
SNCC and you say, “This could be something that we could really begin to exploit.” So can you 
talk about that? 
 
TG: Well, I, I guess I, I, I, just looking at, uh, what had happened previously and looking 
at what, at where there was the possibility of expanding it to, uh, something as we knew more 
about the potential use of nonviolence, I think that that’s what, uh, would have led to the, uh, uh, 
let’s try this “jail in strategy” again kind of thing. I made the point about, uh, the jail in and this 
particular one being pivotal. I remember going to the NAACP national convention in 1960 and, 
uh, there was a lady there named Clara Luper from – 
 
JM: Oklahoma City. 
 
TG: Oklahoma City and she spent all of her time talking about sit-ins that had been done 
by the NAACP youth chapter in Tulsa? 
 
JM: Oklahoma City. 
 
TG: Oklahoma City, in Oklahoma City. And I remember going away from that saying 
yes, but no one knew about them other than Clara Luper and a couple of other people. So that’s 
again that thing that in history sometimes, it’s when you do something, when you have a context, 
that accords significance rather than whether you’ve done it [laughs] or not. I don’t doubt that 
Clara Luper and her group had done sit-ins because she kept saying, well, the, the North Carolina 
people are, but we know about the North Carolina people. They had an impact. We know about 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 38 of 63 
 
the Friendship Nine. I think they had an impact. And historically that’s what we look for as we 
look at the social string that pushes this string, that pushes that one, that pushes that one. 
 
JM: Well, I, that, that, that’s the key point. I think you’re, I, I think I see it the way you 
do, that, that because you were able to set in motion very quickly sort of a turning of attention to 
Rock Hill and many things happened. Can you describe it? Because you’re inside. You’re on the 
chain gang, but you know that many of these things are happening. 
 
TG: But you know the, the, one of the things about being on the chain gang is that we 
were coping with the, the situation, uh, of adjusting and being able to fit in and to do what we 
had to do to survive and to provide a, uh, witness, uh, on the chain gang. What we didn’t realize 
and couldn’t possibly realize was the impact that was going on out there. On Sundays when there 
were a thousand people coming to see us, the only people that we could see would be a line of 
perhaps a hundred people that were coming straight into the, uh, dormitories where we were 
housed. We couldn’t see all of those other people, and we did not have a communications 
network that enabled us to know that so that one of the things that has been tremendously 
gratifying to me is to read what was going on on the outside. 
 
JM: So you didn’t, you didn’t have that information flow? 
 
TG: Oh no, we did not have an information flow that told us. 
 
JM: I thought you would have gotten it through those prison visits, but no. 
 
TG: Uh, no. I mean, if somebody told you, uh, I don’t recall anybody saying, uh, “I’m 
just one of about a thousand people – 
 
JM: I see. 
 
TG: Who, uh, who are out here.” And it was deliberate on the part of the authorities to 
limit the number of people that we saw so as to not break us, but certainly not [laughs] to 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 39 of 63 
 
encourage us because one of the times we wound up in solitary confinement was because they 
wanted us to erect a fence to sort of corral the people who were coming to see us. And so if 
you’re looking only at a straight line, I see twenty-five people, I don’t know how many people 
are along the laterals there.  
 
JM: Yeah. [laughs] Now— 
 
JB: Joe, we have to, we have to stop for a second. 
 
JM: Sure, okay. 
 
TG: Okay.  
 
JB: I have to change the, uh –   
 
JM: Okay, yeah. 
 
TG: Yeah, if you want to stop for awhile, that’s fine with me. 
 
JM: Yeah, take a little break. No, I’m, I’m good. Are you okay? 
 
JB: I think we should keep going. I think we should keep going. 
 
TM: Yeah, I’m okay. You want some – 
 
[Recording stops and then resumes]  
 
JB: Okay. We’re back. 
 
JM: Okay. We’re back after a short break.  
TG: [clears throat] 
JM: Dr. Gaither, let me ask, um, again, I have to pull back just a bit on the calendar. 
TG: [laughs] 
JM: Um, in December, um, [1:20:00] probably I’m guessing just after, the training at 
Claflin – 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 40 of 63 
 
JM: Was, I think, the ninth through the eleventh of December 1960. 
TG: Okay. 
JM: Very close on those dates. Um, and then you were on a bus with Gordon Cary. 
TG: Yes. 
JM: Where you and he do, do some, do some thinking and planning that will have a, just 
a very tremendous impact. So take me back to that ride and its purpose and what you talked 
about. 
TG: Uh, okay. We were going from South Carolina after a training session back to New 
York. Uh, I think Gordon had a copy of Louis Fischer’s book, uh, about Gandhi and, uh, we may 
have even talked about Gandhi’s famous march to the sea, uh, sort of, uh, uh, thing. And, uh, I 
came up with the idea or broached the idea of, um, a Freedom Ride and, uh, the Freedom Riders 
would, uh, essentially copy some of the basic pattern of a 1947 journey that had been staged by 
the Fellowship of Reconciliation and CORE jointly. That’s the ride that, uh, George Houser was 
the, uh, was the scout on. So at some point in the journey, uh, just chit chatting about, uh, one 
thing or another, the idea of a Freedom Ride comes up. We said, “Well, what are we going to 
call this thing?” And I don’t really know whether Gordon said “Freedom Ride” or I said 
“Freedom Ride.” It’s, it’s not critical to me, uh, in terms of who said what at the time.  
But we went on to, uh, suggest that, uh, well, uh, how are we going to, uh, do, do with 
this thing in terms of the mechanics of the, uh, project. Well, we said we’re going to have to have 
people who are very well-trained in, uh, nonviolence and, uh, we’re going to have to have 
somebody who will go down the route of the ride to send back very specific information about 
the, uh, town, the community, the bus schedules, the layout of the bus stations, the mass 
meetings, and all of that sort of thing. And so eventually I would become the person who would 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 41 of 63 
 
assume that, uh, particular function so that I could say that I was the scout for the, for the 
Freedom Ride. 
JM: In April.  
TG: And the choice of places was, uh, determined by the location of historically black 
colleges and universities going southward that we had relationships with where we could house 
the riders and also where we could have meetings to inform the local community because we 
didn’t want to just take a trip through a community without making some connections with the 
local people who would follow up to make sure that whatever happened with us would be a 
springboard for them continuing to protest or taking advantage of any kinds of changes that had, 
would have occurred. 
JM: Yeah. This, this was, you’ve just there described some of the close particulars, but 
pulling back one level, this is audacious. 
TG: [laughs] Well, yeah. 
JM: This is, you’re going to take, you’re going to, you have this notion of pushing all the 
way through the deep South. 
TG: Through the deep South.  
JM: And of course, this – 
TG: The original ride had not gone into the deep South because of the, uh, the danger, uh, 
element, but we were going to go through, uh, Mississippi. We were going through Alabama, 
Mississippi and end up in Louisiana and we knew that the resistance there would be 
considerable. In fact, I think my suggestion was that, uh, if we get through the state of Alabama, 
we’re going to have to have federal protection because Alabama was, uh, along with Mississippi, 
the most resistant places that I thought we would encounter. And remember the NAACP had 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 42 of 63 
 
been outlawed in, uh, in Alabama. So that’s how you got, uh, the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference and Dr. King’s, uh, organization and group going there because it was illegal to be a 
member of the NAACP.  
JM: Exactly, yeah. 
TG: So those three states, we realized were going to be toughies. Now we also realized 
that, uh, there were places in South Carolina like Rock Hill where the possibility was imminent 
and of course, in any of the small towns in any one of those states, you could encounter all kinds 
of difficulties. You could lose your life. 
JM: Yeah. Um, yeah. Tell me about the, so you and Cary, uh, communicate this idea to 
the folks at, at the CORE national office when you arrive. 
TG: This is about the time that James Farmer became the executive secretary of CORE.  
JM: That’s exactly, and that’s exactly right. And, and, and forgive me, but let me just add 
one more thing to contextualize, to set up. You’re right. [1:25:00] This is right in the late 1960, 
early 1961 when Jimmy Robinson’s tenure is in question. There’s uncertainty. He’s after all 
white, not black.  
TG: That’s right. 
JM: And so, yeah. 
TG: Yeah. And so, uh, Jim Farmer was, uh, looking for a project and, uh, this is one that 
had the potential to be very successful and, uh, I don’t think that we estimated how big it would 
become because I think it ultimately was one of the signature protests of the entire Civil Rights 
Movement. I mean, it involved all kinds of people. There were all kinds of inputs and all kinds 
of, uh, positive, uh, things that were brought together to address an issue that got national 
attention. And, uh, I don’t think that, uh, we had that in mind and, uh, evidence to the fact that 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 43 of 63 
 
we didn’t have it in mind is that we had just a dozen or so, uh, very well-trained nonviolent 
soldiers who were going to do this thing and you know you’re not going to get a dozen people, 
no matter how well-trained they are, through Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. So I don’t 
think that, uh, we had estimated the potential, and I think it’s difficult to do that anyway. 
JM: Did you think Dr. King might join? 
TG: [sighs] 
JM: Was that something you were involved in calculating? 
TG: It was not something that I was, um, um, anticipating, um, and it’s something that 
given the magnitude of Dr. King’s contributions, I do not hold one reserve in terms of my respect 
for Dr. King that he didn’t become a Freedom Rider. Uh, he was on the, uh, advisory board, 
national advisory board for CORE. He had been perhaps the primary influence in fleshing out 
nonviolence as a strategy for promoting social change and to me, that was, that’s enough of a 
contribution. I, I don’t care that he did not become a Freedom Rider. 
JM: Um, maybe the question is too obvious, but I don’t know the answer. Why weren’t 
you a Freedom Rider in, in the early stage – 
TG: Why wasn’t I a Freedom Rider? 
JM: Because you were later.  
TG: Okay. 
JM: But, but you did all the scouting. 
TG: I did all the scouting. 
JM: You set the whole thing up.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 44 of 63 
 
TG: And then after setting the whole thing up, I drew the assignment of being the person 
in Jackson who would, uh, take, uh care of, uh, all of the riders when they were, uh, released. I 
had an assignment before that, though. 
JM: Which was? 
TG: My assignment, uh, right after the, uh, bus was burned in Anniston [Alabama] was in 
Montgomery, Alabama. And in Montgomery, I lived in the home of Ralph Abernathy. This is 
when [coughs] after the event in the church, um, Montgomery was under martial law. 
JM: The event in the church was thousands of whites, angry whites massing outside the 
rally at Rev. Abernathy’s church, yeah? 
TG: Yeah, okay. So, um, um, the town is under martial law and, uh, Freedom Riders start 
to trickle in. I was training riders there. Uh, I’d have to go to the, uh, Trailways or the Greyhound 
station to pick up riders. Uh, we would know how many riders were coming in, but we wouldn’t, 
we would know their names, but we didn’t match names with people. So, the, the question was, 
you know, how are you going to get down there? Well, first of all, uh, right outside of Ralph 
Abernathy’s house about a half a block up, there was a Jeep with a National Guardsman driving 
and another National Guardsman in the back seat with a rifle across. So these guys would, uh, 
give us an escort to within a block of the bus station, Trailways or Greyhound. They’d disappear.  
We got to [laughs] get with, uh, a local guy who was my, uh, driver. We got to get from 
there past all of the, uh, rednecks to pick up the riders. We know there are five, but we don’t 
know them. So this is what I would do. I would stand [laughs] in an area near a, uh, telephone 
booth. I would know the gender of the people. As soon as I saw them dial Ralph Abernathy’s 
number, I would go over and rap on, “Come on, come on.” And, uh, that worked for a number of 
times, uh, and we’d go back with those, uh, people past the mob incidentally. [1:30:00] We’d go 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 45 of 63 
 
back past the mob. We would, uh, get in our vehicle. The Jeep would intercept us again, take us 
back to Abernathy’s house.  
Now this was the protection that we are getting. When we needed the National Guard, it 
wasn’t there. We were on our own when we got back to a safe neighborhood. Ralph Abernathy 
lived in a black neighborhood. There was not a lot of chance that there was going to be 
somebody who was going to come in and do us harm, uh, there. And it’s from there that I was 
assigned, uh, to Jackson. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. What, what, thinking back as best you can, to, to watch this whole ride 
unfold, maybe especially, especially from Rock Hill forward, Rock Hill on down to Atlanta and 
then across. 
TG: [clears throat] 
JM: I mean, really, watching your vision unfold in the spectacular really fashion that it 
did and all of that tumult and violence and chaos, the federal government’s involvement, how 
did, I mean, you’re not a, you’re not very, you’re a young man. You’re in your early twenties.  
TG: That’s right, yeah. 
JM: I’m interested in the response and your sense of what’s happening. 
TG: Um. 
JM: As best you can. 
TG: It was a sense of, uh, gratification. It was also a sense of, uh, responsibility for 
people who would, uh, be injured, uh, who might carry those injuries for the rest of their, rest of 
their lives. Uh, it’s one thing to ask me to do that as a person. It’s another thing – But I also 
thought that, uh, uh, we were in this together and what happened to any one of us could have 
happened to any others of, uh, us. And I would have been willing to do and, uh, I was gratified 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 46 of 63 
 
that there were brothers and sisters, white, black, who were similarly minded. So I, I think we 
had grown up to the point here of the level of sacrifice that might be expected, always hoping 
that that would not be the case, but, uh, realizing that, uh, it, it certainly could be the case. 
JM: Right. Um, obviously, the, the, the experience of violence by that point was not 
entirely new to the movement, but it was pretty ferocious. 
TG: Yes. 
JM: And I wonder about your reaction to that. Did that change any part of your 
perspective in any way to see that unfolding? 
TG: Uh, no, because I, I think that the, the idea was that we can’t let violence intimidate 
us into doing, uh, any less than what we think we should be doing and that would be insisting 
that we be treated just like any other citizens. 
JM: How about, um, how about your perspective about the federal government and the 
Kennedy administration in particular after what happened? 
TG: [clears throat] Well, the federal government was, uh, not our ally. I think that, uh, 
they were sort of annoyed that there were all these critical international issues and then you’ve 
got this bunch of blacks and whites who want to ride through the South challenging the culture 
of, uh, of segregation. Uh, I’d be particularly critical of the FBI because there was no community 
that I worked in where I could, uh, talk to an FBI agent. I did once think on a sort of intuitive 
quirk that there was an FBI guy that I could, uh, say something, uh, to. This was when I was 
working in Jackson. Uh, about two months later, I wound up in, uh, federal court. Uh, the agent 
had, uh, hoped that he could implicate me in a conspiracy. Well, it turns out I had been tactful 
enough that when I testified, it really didn’t [laughs] didn’t help their case. So the, uh, the Justice 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 47 of 63 
 
Department, uh, presence, uh, with people like John Doar was, uh, often welcomed and, ah, was 
sincere.  
[Sound of bell ringing] 
 
TG: That’s one of –  
 
JB: Why don’t you just pause? 
 
JM: Excuse for a sec. 
 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
 
JB: Okay. 
 
JM: We’re back on. Let me have you recount that, that last point one more time. 
 
TG: Well, I think the, uh, the, the Justice, we were talking about the Justice Department. 
 
JM: And John Doar, yeah. 
 
TG: Yeah, the Justice Department and Joan Doar. Uh, John Doar did a lot of, uh, very 
good work, I think in, in Mississippi and voter registration protections and so forth, but the, uh, 
sincere involvement and the, uh, uh, by the federal bureaucracy in protecting rights and so forth 
was, uh, grossly negligent. Uh, I think to the Kennedys, this was all about politics. [1:35:00] It 
wasn’t about a moral commitment to protect, uh, citizens who were being disenfranchised by the 
local political culture. 
 
JM: Yeah, yeah. Um, um, I’m asking some of these things because I, later in our 
conversation, I’ll ask you some kind of reflective things and these are part of the ground, I think, 
that, that you go across in this terrain. Um, it must have been, it must have been, and you 
yourself will get on a bus, of course, later in the course of this and it must have been very 
interesting to watch everything turn toward Jackson, toward Parchman, um, and it became really 
a national event. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 48 of 63 
 
 
TG: It did, yes, it did. Yeah, we had, um, people coming in from, uh, various parts of the 
country. We had, uh, various religious groups. I remember the, uh, Episcopalians, the, uh, 
Church of Latter Day Saints, uh, groups. Uh, yeah, it was a, it was a good cross-section of 
America and, uh, that’s the situation where the Freedom Rides started out as a specific protest 
involving a very small group and they wound up being a national movement essentially and, uh, 
I, I don’t think we could have predicted that. 
 
JM: Yeah. How did you, what was your broad sense of the prospects of the movement, 
say, as that summer of ‘61 wound down and the civil rights community is looking for the best 
choices about how to move forward? What was your sense of what the Freedom Rides at that 
point meant and what, what opportunities seemed ahead of you? 
 
TG: Well, I, I saw nonviolent direct action as being a, uh, possible, um, um, root to 
promoting some of the kinds of changes that we wanted to promote. But at the same time, I was 
aware of the impatience of, uh, people who had been tactically nonviolent, who were starting to 
listen to what is a dominant cultural theme, which is violence. And so, uh, there was a kind of 
innocence, there was a kind of moral focus to the early part of the movement, but to be, uh, a 
nonviolent movement, if you go back to Gandhi, it requires a lot of discipline, a lot of training. 
And to ask people in a society that is predominately violent through its core to continue to 
maintain that, I think that that is the, uh, the sad thing about what, uh, happened, uh, with the, uh, 
with the death of Dr. King. I mean, I think that Dr. King’s star, by the time he was, uh, 
assassinated had really started to wane because the violent elements were so ever present until 
they were becoming considerable in terms of how we go about promoting the change that we 
want to promote. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 49 of 63 
 
 
JM: You would move, um, from, from the Freedom Ride into the COFO experience in 
Mississippi. 
 
TG: Uh, yes. Now I didn’t do a lot with the COFO, uh – 
 
JM: Yeah. 
 
TG: Experience. Uh, I, I was there when COFO was founded. 
 
JM: Exactly. Can you, that, that – 
 
TG: And, uh, it seemed to be a natural, uh, kind of thing. Uh, to the segregationists and 
the culture of segregation in Mississippi, there would be no difference between CORE, NAACP, 
SNCC, SCLC. I mean, they, to the segregationists, those were all the same and, uh, we had 
different strengths in terms of what organizations could contribute to the struggle. So I have 
always ascribed to the notion that there were some people who would be active in the NAACP, 
who would never be active in CORE, who would never be active in SCLC, but we need their 
push as a thrust for this movement forward. And so I, I don’t go back and, uh, belabor any 
negative points about the organizations that were involved because I think there were enough 
niches for all of us to put our shoulders to the plow to move this wretched animal of segregation 
out of the way. 
 
JM: Exactly, yeah. Tell me about Bob Moses because you worked with him briefly. 
 
TG: Uh, Bob Moses, uh, a brilliant, uh, guy, um, a visionary. Uh, when we were focused 
on, um, taking care of Freedom Riders, uh, in Jackson, which is when I first, Bob, met Bob 
Moses, [1:40:00] Bob Moses was, uh, uh, involved in managing the campaigns of some of the 
local ministers who were running for Congress. He was looking ahead to the potential for, uh, 
political, uh, status, solidifying some of the gains that we were trying to get to happen or to 
occur. Uh, his, uh, book is on that, uh, the Algebra Project. Uh, he and Dave Dennis, uh, worked 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 50 of 63 
 
together. I have high respect for Bob Moses. One of the things I respect about Bob Moses is that, 
uh, there were people involved in this movement who, in my opinion, were, uh, quite a bit 
centered around themselves and their significance. I think Bob Moses saw the larger picture and 
I think his very low-key manner is to push the issues and the important things as opposed to 
pushing the individual. 
 
JM: Yeah. Um, in ‘62, I guess, you reached the point where because of reasons related to 
your deferment status, you will, certain choices are very stark in front of you. Can you talk about 
what they were and how you – 
 
TG: Okay. Uh, after college, I had, uh, received a number of deferments and, uh, I’d 
gotten to the point of being classified, I think it was 1-A. And so actually I received, when I was 
still right in the midst of working in Jack – in Jackson, I received a, uh, notice that I had to report 
to, uh, Fort Jackson for induction into the army. Now I had been negligent to, uh, make the 
argument that I would object to military service on the basis of conscience because that 
philosophy of nonviolence had, uh, uh, convinced me that I was, would not be a very, very good 
soldier, but I would be willing to serve my country in an alternate, uh, capacity. So not being a 
C.O. [conscientious objector], I get to Fort Jackson. We take all of these, uh, preliminary tests 
the first day. Uh, the sergeant says, “Looks good.” Uh, the next day, uh, he says, “Well, uh, I see 
you have an arrest record here.” I said, “Indeed, I do.” “Um, well, you’re not morally fit to serve 
in the military, except we’ll think about this.” And when he said that, he said, “We’re going to let 
you go for a few days.”  
And I went very quickly to, uh, resurrect the interest that I had shown in a couple of 
graduate schools. One was, uh, Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. The other one that I’d 
been admitted to was, uh, the University of Washington, um, on the West Coast, and, uh, the 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 51 of 63 
 
University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana [Urbana-Champaign]. So I had those choices, but I 
checked to see when sessions were starting and so the sessions were starting for summer school 
at, uh, Atlanta University. So I found myself in graduate school, [laughs] uh, rather quickly and, 
uh, that, of course, staved off the business of having to, uh, to try to resurrect conscientious 
objector status. 
JM: And, and you would spend a final summer of ‘63, I think –  
TG: Yes. 
JM: In Mississippi, right? 
TG: In Mississippi, uh, one year of work on my masters degree. That’s another 
interesting story to this, by the way. Right after the, uh, bus had been burned in Anniston and I 
had been doing some short assignments, I went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison to 
work for CORE, and they were asking questions about the Freedom Rides, uh, so forth and so 
on.  
JM: So this was a field secretary assignment to go up there, yeah, yeah. 
TG: Field secretary assignment. And so I met a, uh, professor whose last name, I think, 
was Rice [University of Wisconsin law professor William G. Rice Jr.] and he said, “You haven’t 
taken the, uh, Law School Aptitude Test.” He said, “But I’m going to recommend you to law 
school.” Now after Claflin and being involved in the movement, I had actually thought of how I 
could get into a profession that would enable me to continue to contribute to the movement, and I 
had decided that law would be that rather than biology. But one year after I had worked on my 
masters degree in biology, I went home to Great Falls and I’m thumbing through this mail and I 
come across this letter admitting me to law school [laughs] at the University of Wisconsin. So he 
said, “You’re, you’re admitted. You will have to take the Law School Aptitude Test as a matter 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 52 of 63 
 
of, uh, record.” [laughs] So that’s how, I, uh, that’s how I, I wound up, uh, [1:45:00] going into 
biology or continuing to work to biology. And, uh, I was successful in biology. So I actually 
wound up getting a couple of graduate teaching assistantships and I chose the one at the 
University of Iowa. 
JM: Tell me about the –  
JB: So you didn’t go to law school. 
JM: We’ll come back to –  
TG: No, I didn’t go to law school. I, I was already halfway through a masters degree in 
biology and I’d always liked biology. So rather than changing to something that was entirely 
different, even though it was closer to the movement, I decided to keep going in biology.  
JM: Well, as you had mentioned, you had earlier met Ernest Finney and Matthew Perry. 
TG: Mm-hmm. 
JM: These were – 
TG: Lawyers, yeah, yeah. 
JM: Superb role models on the, on the lawyering side. 
TG: Bill Kunstler, Carl Rachlin. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
TG: I’d met, you know, a whole variety of, uh, of lawyers who were favorable influences. 
JM: Tell me about, um –  
TG: Let me tell you about my – 
JM: Please. 
TG: My, my, my, my couple of lawyers that, uh, uh, are not very well-known. Um, when 
the riders were, Freedom Riders, were being tried in Jackson, Mississippi, uh, there were perhaps 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 53 of 63 
 
five or six lawyers in Jackson, Mississippi, black lawyers. Uh, there was, uh, Sidney Thorpe was 
the only lawyer who had been trained, well, he’d been trained in a Big Ten university, I think, 
but he would not take Freedom Rider cases. There was Jack Young, who started out as a postal 
clerk and had taken law as a correspondence, who was our chief legal contact. There was, uh, R. 
Jess Brown, who used to be a, uh, social studies teacher at one of the high schools, who had 
graduated from Texas Southern. And there was another man named Carsie Hall, who was also a 
mail clerk. And so those were our core lawyers, R. Jess Brown, uh, Jack Young, and Carsie Hall. 
And, uh, if it was a federal case, we would get people like Derrick Bell and Constance Baker 
Motley or Bill Kunstler or Carl Rachlin. We would get, you know, some other, uh, 
reinforcements, but it was always a nucleus of local guys that sort of coordinated things and tried 
most of the Freedom Rider, uh, cases. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. Tell me about the, the summer of ‘63, going to Mississippi. 
TG: The – 
JM: The summer of ‘63, you did a final three month – 
TG: Oh, yes.  
JM: Yeah. 
TG: The final three months, uh, I worked with Aaron Henry in Clarksdale, Mississippi, 
and, uh, Aaron Henry and the, uh, Clarksdale NAACP were involved in a, uh, selective buying 
program, uh, actually a boycott of downtown, uh, Clarksdale. And so, uh, being there for just 
three months, I was just fitting into and augmenting an existing program, uh, having to do with, 
uh, issues of police brutality, uh, issues of discriminating against, uh, uh, black people in the 
downtown area in the stores, so forth and so on. But the other thing I did there was to be the, uh, 
focus of a Freedom School, uh, that was just a block or so away from Aaron Henry’s, uh, 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 54 of 63 
 
drugstore and we would have coming into the center, I’d say, twenty, twenty-five young people 
every day and we taught freedom songs, uh, history of, uh, blacks in America, so forth and so on.  
And it was there, uh, when, uh, the March on Washington was to, uh, take place and so 
my choice was to stay in Clarksdale or to go to the March on Washington. And I opted to stay in, 
in Clarksdale. I remember as I, uh, told you there helping to put together the sign, “March on 
Washington for Jobs and Freedom,” and then with, uh, SCLC, uh, SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and 
COFO, which was the Council of Federated Organizations, sort of pulling them all together on 
that sign, which the young people from Clarksdale took to the March on Washington. 
JM: Yeah. Then you went back, I guess, to Atlanta for a second year at Atlanta 
University. 
TG: And then, uh, to the University of Iowa. 
JM: Yeah, yeah. 
TG: For the Ph.D. 
JM: Let me propose that we pause here and take a break, yeah? We’re, we’re really 
putting you to hard work. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
 
JB: Okay, we’re on. 
 
JM: We are back after a, a, a break for some refreshment and, um, thank you for that, Dr. 
Gaither. 
 
TG: You’re welcome. 
 
JM: Um, I’d like to, I’d like to ask, um, just, just a few things. [1:50:00] Let me start, 
just, just for the tape record, John thought it’d be good if we, can you just say recap just in a 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 55 of 63 
 
simple descriptive way the member organizations inside COFO and say once more what that 
was? 
 
TG: Okay. Uh, COFO was the Council of Federated Organizations and, uh, the 
representative organizations were SNCC, or the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
the SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, or the NAACP, and CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality. 
 
JM: Yeah, yeah, thank you. 
 
TG: Those together constituted COFO. 
 
JM: And you had earlier talked about how from the perspective of the average white 
Mississippi segregationist, they would have all been one broad mix of –  
 
TG: All, all one. 
 
JM: Outside agitators. 
 
TG: That’s right. 
 
JM: As they would have been known. 
 
TG: That is true. 
 
JM: Yeah. Um, let me have you, I’m very interested in, uh, we can’t do it justice because 
we’ll, we’ll just here have time for a summary, but talk about first your experience in graduate 
school, particularly say in Iowa, and then, um, move to the, to the broader question of your work 
as a scientist. 
 
TG: Uh, first year at Iowa, I was, of course, the only African American student [laughs] 
in the department. There were a couple of Asian, Indian students, uh, in the department. Um, I 
did well academically. I was assigned to be a, uh, graduate teaching assistant in a very large 
course. It was called “Life Science.” It was actually the introductory level, uh, biology course. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 56 of 63 
 
And, uh, we had two responsibilities for the sections that we were assigned. We had the students 
for, uh, laboratory, for a couple of hours a week, and we had them for an hour or so in a 
discussion group. Uh, the discussion group we could deal with, um, uh, points of information 
that students had questions about based on the lecture. Because of the very large number of 
people in the class, uh, the lecturers were just given the time to present the information. To 
embellish or to clarify or something, that was up to the, uh, up to the TA.  
Um, as the only, uh, African American student, there had been previously an African 
American student, uh, from, uh, Louisiana who had graduated and indeed, my mentor or one of 
the persons that was influential in sending me to Iowa actually compared me to his previous 
student that had been there and that was a, sort of an automatic niche for me to be in. Um, there 
were, of course, the usual cross-section of, uh, people, some of whom became close friends, uh, 
until today, but there were also the people who just sort of tolerated you because you were there 
and to them, they would have been just as happy [laughs] if you weren’t there. But, um, the 
professors were, uh, across the spectrum, too. Some very conservative ones were particularly 
standoffish, but I found, uh, enough, uh, favor in professors and they respected me enough as a 
student. And so I didn’t have any major problems, uh, with, with graduate work at Iowa.  
I had decided to go to Iowa because I felt that, uh, if not a, uh, a neutral, uh, place to go, 
uh, it might be, uh, at least a place where I could, uh, find some direction to do something that 
was a potential passion for me. The leader in the field at the time had left Iowa and gone to 
Austin, Texas, and even though Austin, Texas, has a reputation of being, uh, a bit more 
enlightened than some other cities in Texas, I didn’t, coming out of a movement where I was 
fighting discrimination in its most blatant form day in and day out, want to take that same mantle 
to do graduate work at Texas, even though the preeminent scholar in the field was at Texas. So 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 57 of 63 
 
that was sort of one of the things [laughs] that compelled me to go to Iowa. Now I’d mentioned 
that I could have gone to, uh, uh, Washington, Seattle, or Champaign-Urbana [Urbana-
Champaign]. Uh, Champaign-Urbana [Urbana-Champaign] actually did not have the fit program 
that I was primarily interested in and I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to go way out on the West 
Coast. So I wound up going to Iowa. 
JM: Tell me about, um, tell me about the things that have been most important to you, 
um, as a scholar and a researcher over the years. 
TG: Uh, okay. As a researcher, uh, eventually I got into an area of biology that’s called 
electron microscopy, and my specific interest in electron microscopy was to start with the very 
small structures that are inside [1:55:00] of a living system and to see what happens when some 
of those structures transform into, uh, entities that are important for the reproduction of the 
organism. So there was, uh, something that’s called, um, uh, capillitium, or from Latin, capillus, 
meaning a thread. I actually studied how these threads came to be and in the mature reproductive 
structure of the organisms that I studied, the threads have a function because they prevent the 
organism from putting all of its reproductive structures out at once. So they’re out over a longer 
time period, increasing the possibility that some of those reproductive structures will then 
propagate the organism.  
The other interest that I had was using the electron microscope to answer certain 
questions that you couldn’t answer given the limitations of a regular microscope. So you can see 
things with a regular microscope that are only so close to each other. With an electron 
microscope, you can see them much closer. That’s something we call resolution. So with 
improved resolution, a question that might be subjective with a light microscope suddenly 
becomes objective with an electron microscope because you can see more clearly what is there. 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 58 of 63 
 
So that was my interest in using the electron microscope to answer those kinds of questions, 
which were then involved in defining how one species of organism was different from another 
species that was closely related. 
JM: Sure, yeah. 
TG: So it was, uh, speciation or, uh, using electron microscopy to resolve the questions. 
JM: Yeah. Let, let me turn, uh, uh, forgive me because I know that is just the barest 
summary, but for, for, um, our work today, I, I want to turn to, um, civil rights and, and the 
struggle and maybe [someone coughs] to a few retrospective kinds of, of questions. Um, I know 
that in, uh, we’ve just passed the fiftieth anniversary, obviously, of, of the Freedom Ride, uh, 
Freedom Rides. And, um, there are many different ways that people approach that memory and, 
and so I’m, I’m interested in your question of, of different interpretations of the ride and its 
impact and, and how you see the significance of, of the Freedom Rides from this distance. 
TG: Well, I see them as being one of the most important, the most inclusive, the most 
integrative protests as a part of the total civil rights structure. Uh, we were talking about 
attribution of, uh, who did this and who did that. Uh, there is no question that the rides were 
conceived by and, uh, executed primarily by the Congress of Racial Equality. After the bus was 
burned in Anniston, when the riders were no longer capable of continuing, we received a very 
nice contribution from the students in Nashville and the Nashville movement. Now that 
contribution is to be given a great deal of credit, but its credit should not extend to the suggestion 
that CORE was incapable of continuing. In any kind of movement, there are strategic times that 
you move and obviously, you can’t move if you’re physically incapable at that moment. That 
does not mean that you’re not in charge of the sequence of events that is part of an ongoing 
process. So my disappointment was those who would rewrite the history as if the Congress of 
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 59 of 63 
 
Racial Equality, the people who originated and for the most part sponsored, uh, the, uh, rides, 
that these were sort of like rookies who didn’t know what, uh, they were doing. We appreciate 
the contribution of the Nashville people, but it was simply a, uh, contribution that was a part of 
an ongoing process, not a contribution that should consume the, uh, origin of the process and the 
propagation of the events that we label with the term, “Freedom Ride.” 
JM: Sure, yeah. Did you, after you departed for Iowa and then had your, the, the, the long 
run of your career as an academic here in, in Pennsylvania, did you ever live again in the South? 
TG: Uh, no, with the exception of going back for visits. No question, the South has 
changed tremendously, but the fundamental infrastructure [2:00:00] of racism and segregation 
that called the shots in the South in 1960 are still in place. They have slightly different labels, uh, 
they accomplish their goals by slightly different means, but there has been no real fundamental, 
uh, shift in who really calls the signals. Uh, we can have black public officials, but sometimes 
the strength of what those people can do is actually called by shots from the same people who 
were calling [laughs] the shots fifty years ago. So there has been change. A lot of it’s surface, uh, 
change and there’s still an awful lot of work to do.  
JM: Yeah. 
TG: And in this recent thing of a society that is color blind, much of the legal weight for 
making some meaningful changes is continually eroded, and if you’re talking about making 
changes in the southern context, ultimately, that has to come down to the, uh, administrators of 
federal programs and so forth. And very often these are very obviously discriminatory. Witness 
[Hurricane] Katrina [an allusion to the racially discriminatory character of the federal 
government’s response to the disaster]. Witness G. I. Bill, uh, availability and so forth. Uh, if we 
go back to the ‘60s and, uh, we still haven’t, [laughs] uh, pushed the bad guy out of the way yet.  
Dr. Thomas W. afc2010039_crhp0043_gaither_transcript.docx 
p. 60 of 63 
 
JM: Um, from the, from the nearer, the nearer distance in, in terms of time, when you 
were, say, in Iowa and beginning your work as an academic, did you ever, did you ever have 
occasion to, I’m sure the, the question came to your mind, did you ever have occasion to doubt 
nonviolence as a, as a, as a tactical means? Did you ever think that it won’t work here in the 
United, in the American context or –  
TG: Uh, no. I’ve always had faith that it would, uh, work. I think there is a residual, uh, 
moral conscious in, uh, a significant number of Americans that makes it possible for, uh, 
nonviolent tactics to work. They must, however, be waged within a context of people who are 
well-trained and who can, uh, articulate, uh, what it is that they are doing and why are they doing 
it. Uh, one is heartened by some of the, uh, nonviolent-type things that have occurred in the 
Middle East. Uh, so I, I think that there, you know, there is still the possibility for, uh, nonviolent 
direct action being a positive social, positively, uh, promoting a change, uh, process.  
JM: Yeah, yeah. Um, in, in having to, in having to hold the view for all of the many 
reasons that, that support it, that things have not changed so much, does it, has it had the effect 
of, um, well, how, what, what have been the, what have been the, uh, implications for your sense 
of, you know, the American project over the longer term? Do you think that this is a place that, 
that might find its way one day to a more just social order? 
TG: Uh, I hope so and, uh, if one looks at, for example, the, uh, recent, uh, election of, 
uh, Barack Obama, I, I think what we had happening there, uh, and by the way, I was immensely 
surprised that Barack Obama was elected because my mind was clicking back to what I know the 
situation to have been in the ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s. It was the young people who went out and 
rallied for the first time for change. The unfortunate thing is that many of those young people 
have not, uh, persisted with insisting that the change was there. So what we see now in the

inability of Barack Obama to govern is the kinds of factors that, if they had been dominant, 
would not have permitted him to be elected in the first place. Because everything he decides to 
do, the idea is to obstruct him and to prevent positive change from occurring or taking place. If 
the young people were just as involved in making sure that we are sending to people, people to 
Congress who are going to cooperate and who are going to be collegial and who are going to be 
bipartisan, there’d be hope. And I, I have to think that, uh, the young people hold that hope.  
JM: Yeah. Do you, um, look, looking back, the, the, the movement was your passion and 
your work [2:05:00] and you’ve struggled in very difficult contexts for, for years there at the 
opening of the decade of the ‘60s. Are there ways in which, as you think about that, are, are there 
costs that were born by you in an ongoing fashion? Was there a legacy of cost or complication in 
any way for you personally? 
TG: [sighs] 
JM: Because it’s kind of a heavy burden. 
TG: Well, this is [laughs] an interesting, uh, question because when I think back to the 
time, the energy, and the passion that I put into a movement to be, uh, accepted as a citizen, as a 
human being, there are times when I wonder what could I have done with that time to do 
something else that is automatically forthcoming if you happen to be born in this country and 
your skin happens to be white instead of brown. That, that galls me on occasion because I think 
we have lost as a nation a lot of potential and we still lose, uh, that potential when, uh, all you 
have to do is to be born white. You have all these privileges, but if you are black, you’re going to 
have to fight for them. We need all of us on the same page playing the, uh, same tune in order to 
be competitive internationally at this point.

JM: What, I’ll, I’ll, I’ll ask one final question and then invite any further comments you 
might want to make. What would Great Falls, um, South Carolina, look like if you went back 
today? 
TG: Oh, uh, Great Falls, South Carolina, um, a fundamental disconnect with the 
mainstream of American society in terms of almost every aspect of, uh, life. Uh, when I drive 
through Great Falls, uh, I see, uh, a number of men my age, uh, sitting out under a, uh, tree just 
biding the time away and but for the grace of God, there go I sitting, uh, there. These are people 
without hope, for whom the current century has passed, and, uh, quite honestly, I, I, I don’t know 
what, uh, will happen to them. But the tragedy is that they have been lost, but the, uh, tragedy 
that’s even worse is that their children, in many instances, have been lost, too. And, uh, that’s 
downright depressing. I can’t think of, uh, any reason why an industry would go to Great Falls. 
You don’t have a, uh, well-trained labor force. Uh, you don’t have the kinds of, uh, amenities 
that are necessary to run a business, uh, ethically for profit, so forth and so on. So I, I really don’t 
know. It’s one of those questions my parents would say, “I’ll leave it God,” because I, I don’t 
really have a solution for, for Great Falls, except to say that it, uh, it, it hurts me, uh, that, uh, that 
there is not hope, uh, for a future that is bright for Great Falls.  
And what I’m saying might be interpreted to be from a black perspective. I’m a black 
man. But, uh, the South in its, uh, effort to keep black people down has also cheated white 
people, especially poor white people because they’re in the same boat. The white people should 
get together with the black people and move the monkey off the back, but many of them are 
holding onto the fact, “Well, at least I’m white.”  
JM: Are there things we haven’t talked about that you’d like to spend some time on, 
themes we haven’t touched on, other issues, episodes?

TG: Uh, I would mention one other, uh, thing. Uh, I think that scholars are frequently 
misunderstood, and I think that they are, uh, especially misunderstood in the African American 
community because we’ve had so few models on which to, uh, generate a, uh, an idea as to their 
importance or to their significance so that when I tell people I have a Ph.D. in botany, they could 
identify if I had a Ph.D. in agriculture or something that they have a life experience that they can 
connect to it, but to them, my whole contribution to the total of my being and the being of my 
nation, my country, and my race is not comprehendible at all. And, uh, couple that with the fact 
[2:10:00] that, uh, uh, even my parents, uh, I couldn’t understand, I couldn’t explain to them 
exactly what it is that’s my passion I, I do. Uh, in the majority society, usually there is at least 
some way of making a connection that rings clear, but that’s a sort of lonely feeling [laughs] 
being, being out there. But I see my contribution as being more than to, uh, to, to black people, 
but being to the, the nation as a whole. 
JM: Thank you for welcoming us here to Prospect today. 
TG: My pleasure. 
JM: And into your home. It’s just been a real honor and privilege to talk with you. 
JM: Thank you. 
TG: Thank you. 
JM: Thank you so much. 
TG: Uh huh. 
JM: It was a wonderful –
