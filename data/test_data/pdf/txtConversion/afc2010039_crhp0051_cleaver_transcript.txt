JM:  And, um, we’re delighted, and it’s a real privilege and honor to be with Ms. 
Kathleen Neal Cleaver today.  Um, and let me note for the tape that we have two other persons 
who are, uh, sort of auditing, uh, our interview today, Ms. Rondee Gaines and Mr. Henry Gaddis.  
Uh, Ms. Cleaver, what a privilege and pleasure to be with you. 
KC:  Well, thank you.  Thank you for coming. 
JM:  It’s really nice to be here.  Thanks for the warm welcome.  Um, let me start – we 
mentioned before we kicked off the recording that there’s an awful lot of history that we could 
talk about here.  And let’s – why don’t we pick up the story about 1954, obviously with Brown 
[Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] and Vietnam, and move on from there? 
KC:  I like that, because 1954 is a turning point in Vietnam, it’s a turning point in the 
United States, because of the Brown decision, and it’s also a turning point in my life.  I was nine 
years old. 
Now, why was Vietnam in ’54 a turning point?  Because the world of imperialism came 
crashing down in 1954.  French imperialism was destroyed in Vietnam by the Vietnamese, and 
that inspired African colonies to understand that it was possible to defeat the French army.  So, it 
set in motion a wave of anti-colonial liberation movements. 
1954 in the United States was the profound transformation in the consciousness of black 
people when they saw the United States Supreme Court throw out the principle of “separate but 
equal.”  And even though the case said “separate but equal” – “separate but equal” was valid in 
education – it said that it can’t be.  It has to be thrown out.  The decision was about education.  
However, the way that decision was interpreted by the black community was that segregation 
was against the Constitution, and it unleashed all types of popular uprisings.  You can’t have 
segregated libraries – a protest, a protest at the swimming pool, a protest at the bus, a protest at 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 3 of 57 
 
this, so that all around the country where black people were segregated, it inspired protests 
spontaneously and enthusiastic upheaval in our community. 
But it also simultaneously inspired hatred and viciousness in the segregationist 
community, particularly when you look at a place like Mississippi and the murder of Emmett 
Till, who was one of those children who would be affected by the end of segregation in 
education, which they had a horror – this was like a horror to segregationists. 
And so, being nine years old – 
JM:  Forgive me.  May I stop you for one moment? 
 [Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Okay, we’re back. 
JM:  We’re back. 
KC:  So, being a child, being nine years old in 1954, of course, I was impressionable and 
I was aware that my parents were involved in some civil rights activity.  We were, I was aware 
of the excitement.  But we left Alabama.  My father was on the faculty at Tuskegee Institute, and 
my mother worked at the Institute, and it’s a very cohesive, small, uh, community around the 
campus. 
I left all that with my parents, because we – my father, uh, was hired to work in the 
Foreign Aid program in India.  And the reason he was selected in India had to do with his 
training in community development and his work with rural farmers in Alabama.  The United 
States Point Four Program that [President Harry S.] Truman implemented after World War II had 
this position of, uh, “We will help resist Communism.”  The notion that India may have a 
powerful Communist, um, Movement was something the United States was anxious to, anxious 
to, uh – 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 4 of 57 
 
JM:  Forestall? 
KC:  Prevent.  And they developed a community development program to be run in 
villages [5:00] to help the villagers, and my father was hired as a technical director in this kind of 
work.  So, we moved from Tuskegee Institute – uh, John Patterson, I believe, was the governor 
of Alabama; it was, you know, it was a little bit before “segregation today, segregation 
tomorrow, segregation forever,” but it was still that mindset – into a place where Nehru was 
president; uh, it’s a land of Gandhi; it’s a land of independence.  I came into a society that was 
moving from being dominated and directed by British imperial rulers to being ruled by 
representatives of the Indian people.  And so, they were changing the names of the streets.  They 
were, they were moving into an Indian society away from a British colonial society. 
So, I saw all that.  And I saw a government that had lots of dark-skinned people.  I saw 
all sorts of things.  And so, I was so young I’m not – the upshot is that it became very obvious to 
me that there’s no coherent way that someone could say people can’t vote or can’t govern 
themselves because of their color, because of, they’re dark.  So, I mean, so all the propaganda of 
white supremacy, which probably wasn’t going to get to me anyway because of my parents, was 
just blown out of the water. 
So, after two years living in India, my father was transferred to the Philippines, which 
was another society in Asia that had been colonized, but this one had been colonized by the 
United States.  But it was also independent.  So, as the Vietnam War is unfurling and colonial 
movements are developing in – anti-colonial movements are developing in Africa and in Asia, 
you know, I’m just growing up in this atmosphere.  And the work that my father is doing is 
highly political.  Even though I probably didn’t even know the meaning of the word “political,” I 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 5 of 57 
 
was in a highly political environment and I was very influenced.  These are my norms – you 
know, eliminate segregation, eliminate colonialism – from a child. 
And so, we come back briefly to visit the United States, back and forth, up until I went to 
high school in 1961 at a Quaker boarding school.  My parents stayed in Africa, I mean, stayed 
living abroad, but I came to go to this high school.  It just so happened I went to the same high 
school as Julian Bond, although he had already graduated.  And so, my – 
JM:  The George School near Philadelphia? 
KC:  Yes.  So, I have this, [sighs] you know, very unique understanding of the potential 
of people of color to rule themselves, to govern themselves, and then I come to a Quaker school, 
which had been and at least I was under the impression that they were advocates of nonviolent 
peaceful change.  So, I enrolled in ’61. 
About the time I was about to graduate, May of ’63, this is when Birmingham is blowing 
up.  And this is when the students in Birmingham are demonstrating, and [Birmingham 
Commissioner of Public Safety Eugene] “Bull” Connor is bringing out the police dogs, and 
Martin Luther King is in jail, and the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] 
students are down in Albany [Georgia] on the barricades.  They’re going to jail, uh, 
demonstrating.  It was a “jail no bail” campaign in Albany, and they’re all demonstrating. 
And I saw in the Philadelphia newspaper a photograph on the front page.  It was a 
photograph of a paddy wagon from the back, and there were these girls, high school girls, in the 
back, and they were all singing.  And they were being carted off to jail.  And I was just so 
intrigued.  I said, “These are girls.  They’re high school girls.  I’m a high school girl.  These are 
people in Georgia challenging segregation and going to jail.”  And I was just extraordinarily 
impressed.  I mean, it was more than impressed.  I wanted to be like them. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 6 of 57 
 
And we had a program at my high school called Assembly.  So, I decided that [clears 
throat] I wanted to say something about what was going on in Albany.  Now, there’s a trigger.  
It’s a boarding school, so you have a dining hall.  And there was a note put up out at the dining 
hall outside that said, um, “I suggest that we have a fast in the dining hall in support of the 
students in Albany who are praying and fasting in jail.”  And so, I said, “Okay, that’s nice.” 
The next day there’s another note outside the dining hall, and a boy in my class said that 
he thought that [10:00] that was not a good idea.  He said something more critical.  And that 
there should be a more cooperative solution than fasting and, uh, nonviolent protest.  So, I looked 
at that note.  I said, “What is wrong with him?”  I was so impressed that these girls are going up 
against these vicious racists in Georgia!  So, I just said, “Well, who in the world is he to know 
what somebody in Georgia should do?” 
So, I wanted to defend the students but I didn’t really know enough.  So, I went to 
Philadelphia.  Quaker schools have something called Work Camp.  You have to do Work Camp 
before you graduate.  And our Work Camp was in Philadelphia, and they took us to different 
social activist centers, and one of them was called Fellowship House.  And when I had gone to 
Fellowship House, I met a woman named, or I heard about a woman named Prathia Hall who 
was an activist in SNCC.  And so, I said, “Well, I’m going to go talk to Prathia, and she’s going 
to explain to me what this nonviolent movement is, so I can defend it.” 
So, I got on the train and I went to Fellowship House.  And I said, “I would like to see 
Prathia Hall.”  And they said, “Well, she’s not here.  She’s left.  She’s gone to, uh, Georgia.”  So, 
whoever it was, it was a tall painter who lived there.  Um, and I said, “Well, you’re here.  I want 
you to explain [laughing] nonviolence to me, because it’s very important for me to understand 
this.”  He said, “Well, I’ll do the best I can, but Prathia –.”  I said, “No, no, you have to do it.” 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 7 of 57 
 
So, he sat me down and gave me his interpretation – Bunch, Bunky, Bunche?  [Ralph J. 
Bunche] He was an artist, and we became friends for a long time.  And he articulated the central 
principle of transformation and how you engage in love and compassion and, um, you are 
supposed to win over your enemies by loving them and not retaliate when they attack you.  And I 
think I was about seventeen years old, and this was very appealing to me.  I was just very 
intrigued that this was their philosophy, that what they were doing had a meaning, and it made 
me see them as even braver than I understood from reading about them in the newspaper. 
So, I was very impressed and I wrote out this little speech that I was going to make to get 
this guy who said it was, “we should find a more collaborative way of doing things.”  And I went 
to the painting teacher, who I knew well because I had taken her classes, and she was in charge 
of Assembly on Thursday.  So, I said, “Can I make a presentation on Thursday?”  She said, “Oh, 
yes, Kathleen.”  And she didn’t ask me what it was about, [clears throat] and I didn’t tell her. 
So, [laughs] we have our Thursday Assembly, and they say she would like to make a 
presentation.  So, I get up, and I have my speech, and I read it, and I tell them to protest against 
the students, and I think that’s wrong, that they should be understood, that these are their reasons 
for doing it, and those who don’t agree with them should at least respect them, because they are 
doing something about racial injustice under very difficult circumstances.  So, I thought that 
Quakers, um, agreed with nonviolent protest, that they taught nonviolent protest – at least that’s 
what I thought. 
Now, I have to tell you something about the racial dynamics of the school.  It’s about 
four hundred students, uh, in grades nine through twelve.  And of the four hundred students, four 
of them were black.  And of the four black ones, me and another student were from Tuskegee, 
and one student was a day student, and one student was an African foreign student.  So, 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 8 of 57 
 
basically, I’m talking to an entirely middle America, Quaker, white audience of students and 
teachers.  They were not enthusiastic.  In fact, they were very upset!  [Laughs] 
And they started calling me a radical and they said this and they said – and so, I said, 
“Well, we have to have more discussion!”  So, I went back to Friendship [Fellowship] House and 
got the person.  And I said, “You have to come to George School!  They want to discuss this.  I 
don’t know anymore.  So, come!”  So, I brought him, and we had discussions.  And so, that’s 
what happened at the end of high school for me while the protest was going on in Birmingham.  
On my campus, the protest was around my attitude and my discussion of Albany.  So, I would 
say from then, that was, uh, the summer of, uh, ’63, I was very [15:00] focused on civil rights 
activism.  I wanted to do that.  I wanted to be like those students.  I wanted to go on those, um, 
protests that they were on. 
But I had to go where my parents took me.  That summer was the March on Washington.  
My parents came back.  We had family in Baltimore and we were visiting our family in 
Baltimore in August of 1963.  So, I wanted my parents to take me to the March on Washington.  
Well, “Oh, no,” they said, “You cannot go to that.  There will be violence.  It’s going to be 
violent,” which is what was the word in Washington.  This was to prevent people from coming.  
So, I was just very upset that I could be so close, but I couldn’t go. 
And so, in the fall, I went to Oberlin. 
JM:  So you didn’t, you did not go? 
KC:  Oh, my – no.  I didn’t have the, uh, capacity at seventeen or eighteen to be able to 
do things that my parents wouldn’t allow.  So, um – 
JM:  This all will soon change.  [Laughs] 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 9 of 57 
 
KC:  Um, I didn’t understand their opposition!  I really didn’t!  And it wasn’t violent, but 
the propaganda that had gone out in Washington, and my father was working in Washington, and 
he was a government, uh, he was a Foreign Service officer.  So, part of that was his caution.  But 
the other part was I think they did believe – I mean, my mother and father both had been active.  
So, my father had been involved in the, uh, effort to desegregate the white primary in Texas back 
in the ’30s.  And my mother had been involved in the, uh, Southern Negro Youth Congress, 
which, uh, protested education segregation, and she was the beneficiary of a, of a consent decree 
between the NAACP and the state of Virginia to be able to go to school in, graduate school in 
Michigan, because you could have segregated elementary, high school, and college, but there 
was no graduate school for blacks.  So, for her to go to graduate school, she benefited from a, uh, 
agreement that the state of Virginia would pay tuition for anyone who was accepted, and so she 
went to Michigan.  And so, it wasn’t that they weren’t for civil rights.  It was that that was the 
attitude of, uh, 1963. 
And, um, so I went away to college to Oberlin.  My parents had picked out Oberlin.  
They thought this was a fine college, and I should go.  Oberlin happened to be a hotbed of civil 
rights, which I didn’t really know.  But also I didn’t really know much about colleges, because 
from the time I was – what – nine, I was living away from the United States.  We had come back 
in the late ’50s.  I had gone to high school in Baltimore for a year. 
JM:  After your brother died? 
KC:  My brother died in ’58, and, uh, ’59 I went to, uh, Baltimore public school.  And 
then we went back and lived in Africa.  And so, then I came back and went to boarding school 
and finished.  So, I didn’t really have a lot of exposure.  I didn’t really know a lot about colleges.  
And I had been geared to go to Oberlin.  I applied and got in and I went there.  And there were 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 10 of 57 
 
some friends from Tuskegee there, and there was an active civil rights group who were both 
black and white.  I mean, there weren’t enough – there weren’t that many black students there, 
but probably more than at some of the other schools. 
And so, I was influenced – I shouldn’t say influenced.  I was in an atmosphere that was 
very conducive.  Carey McWilliams was one of the faculty there.  There was a Japanese 
professor, uh, named – I’m not remembering his name right now – uh, who was quite, uh, 
radical.  And there was this, um, um, there were a lot of speakers who were coming to Oberlin 
and talking about different protests.  The one I remember in particular was about Danville 
[Virginia].  There was a huge protest against segregation in Danville, Virginia, and there were 
lots and lots of, uh, I guess you’d say marches, and there was police brutality, and there was a 
documentary about it.  So that was like very eye-opening: Are these the things that are 
happening?  And the Mississippi Summer Project was being planned for the summer of ’64, 
when I would be, you know, the end of my freshman year.  But the beginning of the freshman 
year was when the children were killed in the, uh, Sixteenth Street Baptist Church [in 
Birmingham, Alabama].  That was in September. 
JM:  September. 
KC:  And then, in a few months, the President of the United States [John F. Kennedy] 
was killed [20:00] in Texas, you know.  And so, it, the – I remember that the group that I, my 
friends, we were all quite upset and didn’t know what the civil rights struggle was going to be 
like, because we thought then that President Kennedy was supportive.  And when he was killed, 
and Lyndon Johnson, with his southern drawl, became the President, it, it didn’t look good.  
[Laughs] It didn’t sound right.  You know, no one in 1963 ever, ever expected – none of the 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 11 of 57 
 
young people ever expected President Johnson to, uh, be an advocate of civil rights, because he 
had voted against everything.  He was a representative of Texas, so he represented Texas views. 
So, uh, I wanted to go to Mississippi, but I actually couldn’t quite manage to do it.  Um, I 
didn’t, I didn’t think I was, um, sturdy enough, or smart enough, or, you know, college freshmen 
– it takes a while to get a sense of who you are.  So, I didn’t go to the Mississippi Summer 
Project.  I didn’t sign up for it.  And, um, I actually quit college and, um, went to stay in 
Washington and had a few jobs.  I really didn’t – I actually didn’t like college.  I was so 
disappointed.  I thought it was going to be exciting and stimulating and dramatic.  Oh, I had this 
very exaggerated view of what [laughs] college was going to be, and it wasn’t all that.  So, um, I 
just went and got a job working in various agencies, government agencies. 
JM:  One of those jobs, I think – I just want to ask, because I wonder how you think 
about it in retrospect – was, I think, the Community Relations Service. 
KC:  Yes. 
JM:  And one of your chores, as I understand, was to type up certain reports that – 
KC:  When I got the job at the Peace Corps, my job was to – it was something very low, 
like a GS-7, and I think I had to put little flyers in racks and sign out the Peace Corps film.  And 
a man who worked there, uh, Richard Thornell, said he was going to go work over at the Human 
– um, at the CRS, Community Relations Service, which was a brand new agency set up under the 
’64 Civil Rights Act.  And he wanted me to come and work as his secretary.  He said, “You 
could do more than this.”  So, I agreed and I got a raise and I got to be his secretary.  And my job 
was to type reports in triplicate, working for the government. 
And so, he would go – the one I remember most vividly was Cleveland.  He went to 
Cleveland [clears throat] after riots, because the Community Relations Service sent teams into – 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 12 of 57 
 
teams would be one or two people, uh, and a secretary maybe – teams into areas of conflict.  And 
then, they would, uh, make a report to the Community Relations Service about the conflict.  And 
so, I would type up all the things he said about the Hough area and Cleveland and the economics. 
I mean, it’s almost – when you read the reports that – something is going to blow up.  I 
mean, it’s not, it’s not an unpredictable situation in the ghetto environment that they described 
that this – you know, conflagrations, riots, rebellions – would happen.  So, I did that over and 
over and over.  And I believe, um, in February Malcolm X was murdered.  Now, I hadn’t 
actually gotten to hear him in person, but I was aware of him.  I would have liked to have gone to 
hear him in person.  Um [clears throat] – 
JB:  Could we pause for just a second? 
JM:  Sure. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Okay, we’re back. 
KC:  [Clears throat] I’m sorry for laughing, um, when I said [laughing] I would have 
liked to have heard Malcolm X in person.  When I was in – it was either Baltimore or 
Washington.  There was a flyer out, and it said, “Come hear Malcolm X debate James Baldwin.” 
JM:  I think that happened at Howard [University]. 
KC:  I don’t know where it was. 
JM:  Howard University, yeah. 
KC:  Well, this was not the one that I – the one that I tried to go to [clears throat] was at a 
mosque, one of these, uh, Muslim mosques.  And, uh, I did get my father to take me.  I’m not 
sure if my mother came.  [25:00] Anyway, we went to this – I think it was in Baltimore – we 
went to this, um, address.  And my father is fairly light-skinned, and, um, I think my hair was 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 13 of 57 
 
straightened at the time, and we get there.  [Laughs] The Muslims at the door look at us very, 
very – actually my mother did come.  My mother and father and me, we all went.  They look at 
us very, very carefully. 
And they finally decided it was okay for my mother to come and was probably okay – but 
I could not come in.  They would not let me come in because they thought I was white.  So, I 
said, “Well, my father’s – this is my father.  This is my mother.  How could they come in, and I 
can’t come in?”  And they just – finally, I guess we just wouldn’t leave, and they let us in.  But it 
wasn’t any Malcolm X and James Baldwin.  It was a movie.  I mean, it was like a TV tape of a 
debate between Malcolm X and James Baldwin.  So, uh, and then – you know. 
So, to be my age and aware of the things I was aware of, and to see, you know, President 
Kennedy is assassinated, and Martin Luther King is sent to jail, and Malcolm X is being killed, 
this is not – this country is not going in the right direction.  So, um – let’s take a break. 
JM:  Sure, let’s take a break. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Okay, we’re rolling. 
JM:  Okay, we’re back.  And we’re going to pick up the story in 1965.  And let me just 
make a note we’re going to take out the prior little clip. 
KC:  Okay. 
JB:  Which we think is 1967 – 167. 
JM:  We think is track 167.  Okay. 
KC:  Well, you can imagine my parents were quite distressed when I told them I wasn’t 
going to go back to college.  So, I spent that year working in D.C.  I was working with the CRS 
[Community Relations Service].  I had a really good experience, because the director – not the 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 14 of 57 
 
director – the deputy director was Roger Wilkins, who was an attorney and a civil rights attorney 
and a very good person.  I think the director was some – uh, it was in the Department of 
Commerce.  It was someone else.  But to be with Richard Thornell and with Roger Wilkins, and 
to have that as a job and to be – just to hear the kinds of things they said.  And Roger Wilkins 
actually knew my father. 
Um, and, um – how did I meet this person?  Yes, my father had a position in Sierra 
Leone.  He was the representative of the, uh – he was the representative of the United States in 
Sierra Leone when he was first sent there, because it was a British colony, so the United States 
couldn’t actually have an ambassador.  So, we lived in Freetown for, um, a while in ’61.  And I 
met, um, one of the Crossroads Africa students who came there, also with Peace Corps, that my 
father – because he was the American representative, he had a party to bring these people who 
had come to Africa.  And one of them I met, who ended up – his name was James Thomas.  He 
ended up being a law student who was working for CRS. 
So, um, here I’m meeting people who are interested in law and civil rights and justice in 
ways that I wasn’t particularly exposed to.  But I’m meeting them in ways in which I actually get 
to know them and hear what they are, um, about.  In fact, James Thomas, who was a law student, 
I had, uh, been invited I think when I was in high school to come up to Yale Law School by him.  
I was in high school, he was in law school, but he invited me to come to his moot court, uh, you 
know, your first trial.  And I met, of all people, because it was Yale Law School, because it was 
1962 or whatever year it was, ’62 or ’63, I met, uh, Marian Wright, who was a law student in his 
class, who later became Marian Wright Edelman.  I also met, um, um, um – I’m blanking on her 
name.  Who is the D.C. Representative? 
JM:  Oh, Eleanor Holmes Norton? 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 15 of 57 
 
KC:  Eleanor Holmes!  She wasn’t Norton. 
JM:  Yep. 
KC:  Marian Wright and Eleanor Holmes, who were in his class at law school, or they 
may have been a bit ahead of him.  So, this is, this is the atmosphere of inspiration and education 
[30:00] that was – I wasn’t – I don’t think I encountered any types of people close to me that 
were against civil rights or against the Movement, so everything was encouraging.  [Sound of 
sirens in background] It was all, all things going in the same direction – except my parents were 
quite unhappy that I wasn’t in college, and they wanted me to go back.  And I really was having 
a great time and didn’t want to go back. 
But I did want to go to New York.  So, um, I applied to a college in New York called 
Barnard [College] and was accepted.  And they advertised [laughs] the fact that Barnard is in 
New York: This is where you learn, by being in New York.  I said [laughing], “Oh, I like that 
idea.  I want to go to New York.”  So, they were happy.  I was happy.  I went to New York.  
After about I’d say three weeks at Barnard, I said, “This is dumb.”  I was at Oberlin and actually 
worked and studied and went to class and got okay grades.  But when I got to Barnard, the 
classes weren’t that interesting, and after a while, I just stopped going. 
And I had met that summer [clears throat] a man named George Ware, who was in 
SNCC.  He had been in SNCC in Atlanta and he had actually – I’m sorry, he had been affiliated 
with SNCC from the Tuskegee Student Movement.  He was the director of something called, or 
he was a leader – I don’t know if he was the director – of something called TIAL, Tuskegee 
Institute Advancement League.  And, um, [clears throat] they were engaged in the big huge 
protest in, um, Selma.  But the Selma to Montgomery March was one aspect, and the Tuskegee 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 16 of 57 
 
to Montgomery March was another aspect.  So, I was meeting someone who was, like, one of the 
actual SNCC leaders.  I was very excited. 
And the important thing about meeting George – there was a graduate student who lived 
in Washington, whose mother had been a teacher in Tuskegee and knew my mother.  And he 
found out I was there that summer and came to visit, and we ended up dating.  And George Ware 
was his best friend, so that’s how I met George.  And long story short, George ultimately hired 
me as his assistant in the campus program in SNCC. 
But before he did that, [clears throat] I had this very transformative conversa – like, not a 
conversation.  Because I’d never met him before, uh, when we first met, he started recounting 
what had happened in Tuskegee and the demonstrations and how they built up the, uh, student 
energy and how they had decided they were going to challenge the – it wasn’t just racism they 
were challenging.  What they wanted to challenge was the manner in which the civil rights 
protest in Alabama, in general, and Tuskegee, in particular, was being geared to a – he thought it 
was too collaborative. 
He said, “These people think they can work together.  You know, that there’s a City 
Council; they want to get people to register to vote and to hold office.”  Let’s say they were.  
Let’s say there were nine seats.  Macon County was [sighs] eighty-eight percent [laughs] black.  
Um, Tuskegee is the county seat.  So, if the representation in voting even mildly reflected the 
demographics of the county, they could have an entirely black Council.  But the TCA, Tuskegee 
Civic Association, wanted to not be assertive, but they wanted to participate, so they only ran 
two candidates.  And George thought that was horrible. 
And George said, “Look, we’ve got to break this up.  These people, they just – they 
essentially want to get along, want this,” and he said, “I know what we can do.  We’ll have a –” 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 17 of 57 
 
not exactly a demonstration.  But he said, “We will go integrate their church in the white side of 
town.”  And he said, “And then you’ll see the parents come out,” because the citizens had come 
out with guns and attacked the children.  So, [clears throat] so, they consciously, consciously had 
demonstrations at the white churches, and they got very, very upset.  Everyone got very upset.   
Uh, then SNCC was also very engaged in voter registration.  And he was telling me all 
about the SNCC activities in Tuskegee, but it was – you know, it was like – I was in Tuskegee 
when I was a little child.  It was very stable, and nobody was challenging – they were 
challenging, like, segregation.  They were challenging the denial of the right to vote.  But they 
weren’t challenging themselves or their methods.  But that’s what TIAL was doing.  And what 
actually ended up happening in Tuskegee was that Dr. [Charles] Gomillion and TCA [Tuskegee 
Civic Association] backed down.  They said, “All right.  You want to do things differently.  Go 
ahead,” which is very interesting.  It’s a very interesting transition. 
So, George was telling me all this, and I’m not giving you the best description. 
JB:  Can we pause? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Sorry about that. 
JM:  Okay, we’re back. 
KC:  So, the, listening that evening to George Ware talk about Tuskegee and talk about 
TIAL was just transformative.  I saw Tuskegee in a light that I’d never seen it before.  But I 
[35:00] also saw the power of black political action that I’d never seen before.  And George 
became a mentor to me, in terms of politics and understanding.  He was a chemist, so he was 
very analytical.  But he never talked about chemistry.  He talked about the activism, and he was 
from Alabama, I mean, from rural Alabama.  And he had gone to the graduate school at 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 18 of 57 
 
Tuskegee.  He was brilliant.  And his friend, um, who I was dating, was a student at the vet 
school, and he was an activist.  I think he had gotten kicked out for starting a black newspaper. 
So, um, I went on – that summer, I went on to Barnard, enrolled at Columbia [University, 
at which Barnard is a college].  And George had a job in New York.  No, he had a job in New 
Jersey with a chemist, chemistry company, Hoffman-LaRoche [Corporation].  And Ernest [likely 
Stevens] had a fellowship with a, uh – uh, he was a veterinary student, so he worked in some lab 
downtown in NYU.  It just so happened that they rented an apartment on the Columbia campus 
that was across the street from Barnard. 
So, we were very close, and I spent a lot of my time after the first three weeks of 
realizing [clears throat] these classes are going to be really dull, and the teachers weren’t that 
smart, and the material isn’t that interesting.  And I had a comparison.  You see, I had already 
been a freshman, so, I had, I knew, you know, [laughs] I’m a sophomore now.  I had a 
comparison: “This is not a good school.  This is a waste of time.”  And, um, I’m learning more 
hanging out with George and Ernest, which was true.  I met Stokely Carmichael at their 
apartment.  I met Ivanhoe Donaldson at a party at their house. 
And that summer I met Ivanhoe Donaldson he had come from – he was a project director 
in Mississippi during the ’64 Summer Project and he met me – he had gone to Michigan State, 
and Ernest had gone to Michigan State, and they kind of knew each other.  So, I felt in a very 
friendly environment.  And Ivanhoe asked me, “Well, what are you doing?”  And I said, “Well, 
I’m out of school for the summer.  I’m looking for a job.”  And he said, “Well, I’m looking for a 
secretary.  How would like to work at SNCC?” 
And I said, “Oh, my God!  I’ve been wanting to work for SNCC ever since I heard about 
the demonstrations in Albany!”  You know, “What time do I need to come?!”  He said, “Well, 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 19 of 57 
 
here,” and he wrote a little note and told me to come such-and-such time.  So, I ran down – what 
was it – 100 Fifth Avenue, I think it was, rickety stairs.  I ran down there.  I was, it was like I’d 
gone to heaven!  “I’m working at SNCC!”  Oh, I had a job at SNCC, so I was so excited! 
And what that job, that summer job was – I think I sat in the front of the building, in front 
of his office at a desk, and so I saw everyone who would come in, and they’d have to stop and 
ask me what they wanted or whatever.  So, um, [clears throat] I got to see – New York was the 
place that activists from the South would come for R&R.  So, if you needed to go to the dentist, 
they’d come out of Mississippi [laughs] and go to dentists in New York.  Or you just needed a 
break.  Or some people were just so burned out they were through.  They were through with 
SNCC.  They’d come and they were going to go back to school or they were doing whatever.  
But they’d all come through the New York SNCC office.  And this New York office was the 
fundraising office, so they had the benefits and they had the money. 
And this was 1966.  This is the summer of 1966.  And the day, the month that I get the, 
um, job to work in, um, the SNCC office in New York, I think it was probably about two weeks 
after the call for Black Power [40:00] in, uh, Greenville, Mississippi.  And so, SNCC has already 
asked the executives, any people in the leadership position, that are white have been asked to 
leave, and there are no longer any white leaders.  But there’s people who are in the organization, 
uh, who work, like there’s a bookkeeper in New York, but there’s very few.  The numbers of 
people who are white are diminishing. 
The director of the New York office was a Chicano.  Actually, her name was Elizabeth 
Southerland [later Elizabeth “Betita” Martinez], and at the time people didn’t identify as 
Mexican.  So, we didn’t – I never just thought what she was.  She was just a dark-haired woman.  
I guess we knew she wasn’t black, but she was something.  She had brown skin.  So, um, but she 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 20 of 57 
 
was being replaced by Ivanhoe, so there was a woman who was not a black person being 
replaced by a black activist out of Mississippi. 
So, I come into the mix, and it’s this tremendous turmoil, because Black Power has been 
articulated.  “Black Power” is the – an ideological or an activist call that’s replaced “Freedom 
Now” in the wake of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.  And it’s also changed the 
dynamic of the leadership in SNCC, because the executive committee and the program 
committee and the chairman are now all part of the – I used to call them the “Black Power 
faction.”  Everybody in SNCC is not onboard for Black Power. 
JM:  Can I ask about this? 
KC:  Of course. 
JM:  In March – March?  Was it March of ’66 that, um, Stokely Carmichael ousts John 
Lewis? 
KC:  That would have been at a staff meeting – 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  At midnight of – 
JM:  A retreat. 
KC:  Yes, but he didn’t oust him, just oust him.  There was an election that, uh – you 
have to understand that in SNCC the role of chairman didn’t really mean much.  It meant the 
person who talked to the press or if you could send somebody to answer a question.  So, nobody 
really minded whether John Lewis was the chairman.  That was just his job.  He would answer 
the questions: “Oh, ask John.”  However, Stokely and his crew thought the chairman should be 
more active.  And they weren’t pleased with his reelection and they re – they had another vote!  
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 21 of 57 
 
John Lewis went to sleep, thinking he was the chairman.  And he woke up and found out he was 
not the chairman, that Stokely was the chairman. 
JM:  Were those stories that you heard through George and Ernest when you were – 
across that spring?  I don’t know if it matters, but – 
KC:  I probably heard them after I got into SNCC. 
JM:  Yeah, okay. 
KC:  Because when I was in New York – but George, I have to say George and Stokely 
were good friends. 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  So, I’m sure everything I heard – I might have, I probably heard it from George.  
Everything I heard about Stokely was in Stokely’s favor. 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  I never heard it from the perspective of John. 
JM:  Yeah.  Let me ask you one other thing, too, before – 
KC:  Sure. 
JM:  Because you’re now in the summer of ’66.  But in January of ’66, someone you 
knew as a child is murdered in Tuskegee, and I just wanted to – 
KC:  I think, yeah, let me get back to that – 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  Because this goes, this – [clears throat] okay, um, while I was in New York, um – 
hold on.  Let me stop. 
JM:  Sure. 
KC:  I want to get – 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 22 of 57 
 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re back. 
JM:  We’re back after a short break. 
KC:  I was a friend and in the same class with Sammy Younge [Samuel L. Younge Jr.] in 
Tuskegee.  We had a lot of the same friends, but he was Catholic and he didn’t go to the same 
school I went to.  But everyone in the same group – we all knew each other.  And he got 
involved in SNCC in Tuskegee after coming back from, uh, the Navy, which is sort of unusual.  I 
don’t think any of my classmates signed up for the military that early.  But Sammy joined the 
Navy; he got out, came back to Tuskegee, and enrolled to go to college.  And [clears throat] he 
was extraordinarily active.  And George was one of the people who told me all about what 
Sammy was doing, because he was very – sort of like with me, he was very nurturing and, uh, he 
was developing these activists.  And Sammy was one. 
And Sammy was actually very important, because he was going back and forth between 
Alabama and Mississippi, and looking at the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party operation 
and how that was problematic, and then helping figure out how in Alabama they could have a 
black political party, not a party that’s going to try and unseat Democrats, but an independent 
black party that was started in Lowndes County.  So, Stokely Carmichael, Rap Brown, and 
Sammy Younge, and George Ware were all working [45:00] kind of together in Lowndes 
County.  So, George plugged me into this. 
And midway through the school year, I think it was January, we heard on the radio that 
Sammy Younge was murdered.  He was shot in the back at a, at a, uh, gas station, by this, uh, gas 
station attendant whose name was Marvin Segrest.  And it was devastating.  It was devastating to 
SNCC.  Uh, James Forman talked about how he had “gone to too many funerals.” 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 23 of 57 
 
[Kitchen sounds going on in background] 
And it was Sammy’s murder in Tuskegee – and when I say he was murdered, what he 
was doing was registering blacks to vote, going out in the county.  When I talked about the 
eighty-eight percent and the demographics, if Sammy Younge had had his wishes, he would have 
registered every black person in Macon County.  And the Klan could see what he was doing, and 
there were death threats all the time.  He had Deacons for Defense protecting his house. 
So, when Sammy was murdered, um, the students kind of blew up.  There were protests; 
there were demonstrations.  George Ware felt – he felt guilty.  He felt that he was the one who 
had inspired and led and encouraged Sammy to take all these risks to do what he was doing, and 
when Sammy was killed, he was in New York.  So, George made the decision to quit Hoffman-
LaRoche and go back into the Movement.  And he left New York and moved to Atlanta and took 
over the campus program in Atlanta, I think, in – very shortly after – which was a big decision 
for someone who had master’s degree in chemistry.  But he rededicated himself to the 
Movement. 
And it was – SNCC – because Sammy was a veteran – Sammy had been in the Navy.  
Because he was a veteran, when Sammy was killed, SNCC took, um, a position against the 
Vietnam War.  And they said, “How can, how can we actually support this war and ask men to 
register to fight when we have a veteran here who was just murdered in cold blood and 
unarmed?” 
And that led – Sammy’s death led to, uh, Julian Bond, uh, being asked – and he had just 
won an election for the state legislature here in, um, Atlanta – he was asked did he support 
SNCC’s position against the Vietnam War?  I don’t think he had actually read it, the actual 
statement, but he knew about it.  And he said, “Yes,” he did support it.  If SNCC took this 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 24 of 57 
 
position against the war, he would support it, even though he was actually no longer in SNCC 
and had just won office in the state legislature.  And so, the news media in Georgia went berserk, 
and he was denied his ability to take his seat in the Georgia legislature because he didn’t support 
the Vietnam War.  And this went on and on, and then it went up to the Supreme Court before – 
he won another election, he won again, before he could even take his seat. 
So, it was a big, big deal in the Movement that – the transformations that happened in 
response to Sammy’s death, and the transformation in George.  And I had joined the, um, New 
York office, you know, a few months after, a few weeks after Black Power and was in those 
changes.  And when George got to, um, George got to, um, Atlanta, he said he actually wanted 
me to come down and work for him.  So, at the end of, um – I think at the end of January of ’67, 
I left New York and went to Atlanta, and I was working constantly.  I have never, ever in my 
life, before or since, spent so much time at meetings and taking notes. 
I think the first meeting I went to was Jim Forman and a few other people – because 
SNCC was in bad shape.  It was, uh, financially in trouble.  So many people had burnt out.  
Projects were being eliminated.  Direct action wasn’t the policy any longer.  It was Black Power, 
and, uh, Stokely was, uh, disturbing some of the fundraisers – I shouldn’t say – some of the 
people who were giving money to SNCC. 
JM:  Had the Palestine statement yet been made by the time you arrived in Atlanta? 
KC:  All those things were in play. 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  Um, the research, the research [50:00] for the, uh, newsletter that was published by 
SNCC that criticized the Stern Gang and Moshe Dayan and the Israeli techniques of, uh, warfare 
that were very injurious to children – they were – something that I remember about little cluster 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 25 of 57 
 
bombs that looked like toys.  And all this research had been done by a man named Jack Minnis, 
and it was written up in a newsletter by a woman named, um, [clears throat] Ethel Minor, and it 
was published. 
And Stokely was an advocate in the ’67 war [Six-Day War] of the support of Egypt and 
not supporting Israel.  And so, he was very public about this.  And many of the financial donors 
and supporters of SNCC were Jewish, and some of the whites that had worked in SNCC were 
Jewish, and they were horrified, uh, at this development.  And I was told – I don’t know if it’s 
accurate – that Harry Belafonte said he was going to smash the organization because they were – 
you know, that was not permissible in his mind, uh, to take that position. 
Um, and we went on our merry way.  So, by the time I got to SNCC, it was in sort of a 
crisis.  I didn’t understand that this was the crisis of the crisis.  But all the elements of crisis – 
people leaving, drama, long meetings – I think the report that came out of this two- or three-day 
meeting was called “Rock Bottom.”  And, um, we sat – you know, I was just taking notes.  That 
was my job, to take notes.  Taking notes – the meeting went on for about fourteen hours.  And 
they sort of – I was exhausted.  But I learned – you know, I couldn’t stop!  It was amazing to 
hear, to be in the room. 
James Forman was my most – oh, how would I put it?  The person I had admired the 
most of the civil rights leaders that I had seen at a distance.  When I was in high school, there 
was a photograph of James Forman in JET magazine, and it was taken in Mississippi, and it was 
riveting and unforgettable.  It was a picture taken in Mississippi, and on one side was this sheriff, 
Mississippi sheriff, your typical southern sheriff.  And then, on the other side, facing toe to toe, 
was Jim Forman in his overalls and his bushy hair, and they were looking at each other.  And he 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 26 of 57 
 
had an expression in his eyes that was so intense, it was like all the passion and anger and 
intelligence that he could muster to stop this man from doing what he was going to do. 
And I was just amazed.  This is extraordinary.  It’s an extraordinary man.  It’s an 
extraordinary time.  And he inspired this kind of devotion and attraction, and people – people 
wanted to give their life for Jim Forman.  They’d do anything for Jim Forman.  So, yes, and I’d 
stay up for three days and take notes for Jim Forman.  [Laughs] And, uh, it was, I was, I felt – 
and I had asked my father to help me. 
When school was over, I went to work at SNCC for the summer.  And then, he said to me 
– um, I said, I wrote to him and I said, “This is so much more educational.  I can’t –” how did I 
put it?  I think I said, “You’re wasting your money paying tuition at Barnard.  What I want you 
to do is give me the money that you would give to Barnard, and I will get a much better 
education in SNCC than in Barnard.” 
And he agreed.  He said he’d do it for a year.  So, uh, you must understand tuition back 
then was about eight hundred dollars a semester.  So, he would send me – I think he would send 
me checks every month.  I don’t remember getting a lump sum.  I can’t imagine my father even 
giving me [laughs] a lump sum.  But, um, so I went to SNCC in, um, in Atlanta.  Uh, after 
starting in the summer, I stayed through to January. 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  And, um, came down to Atlanta.  And it really did feel like I was in the midst of a 
revolution, because SNCC was in chaos, although I wasn’t sure it was chaos.  I was just learning 
so much.  But, you know, the phones were getting cut off.  And then, we didn’t have any more 
money to buy gas.  And then, the cars couldn’t get repaired so to get to work we had to [55:00] 
hitchhike.  And all this – um, I think I cut my hair in an Afro in New York, or I got someone to 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 27 of 57 
 
cut it.  And when we got down to Atlanta, they weren’t that popular here in ’67, and they called 
them “baby haircuts.”  [Laughs] 
So, we would hitchhike.  We would hitchhike to work, because there were no cars, there 
was no money.  Uh, George Ware had an apartment that was actually, belonged to Stokely, and 
he lived there, Ernest Stevens lived there, Simuel Schutz lived there, and I moved in there.  So, 
we had – our whole little campus program lived in one apartment, and the money my father sent 
me paid our rent, because SNCC didn’t have any money for salaries.  So, we were a cadre. 
And, um, the project that George was working on when I came, after the “Rock Bottom” 
report, was a conference called Liberation Will Come from a Black Thing.  Uh, we were going to 
invite the student groups that had supported SNCC to a conference.  This was very early in this 
issue, this notion of “black” students.  There were “Negro” student organizations, “Negro” 
student associations, in various colleges.  But what the Black Power Movement had stimulated 
was a change in consciousness, and there was beginning, like out in California, the San Francisco 
State Negro Student Association became the Black Student Union, one of the earliest.  And so, 
this idea of black students was fairly radical at this time. 
So, we were having, we planned this conference at Fisk [University], because there was a 
student support group at Tennessee State and there was a group at Fisk that were very strong.  
And they had good programs; they had good leaders; they were, you know, raised money; they 
worked closely with the people in SNCC.  So, they were a good home for the conference.  They 
got the buildings.  We sent out the notices, we sent out the letters, we invited the students and we 
invited our speakers. 
Now, we invited lots of speakers: uh, Amiri Baraka – I think he was LeRoi Jones at the 
time.  We invited a writer from, um, Mississippi.  Uh, oh, she was a famous writer at the time, 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 28 of 57 
 
Margaret Walker?  Is that her name?  I’ll have to look it up for you.  Uh, she had written a novel 
about the South.  We invited people from – we invited Eldridge Cleaver, who had published in 
Ramparts, and other activist-scholars, Charles Hamilton from Columbia, a political scientist.  
These are the names I remember.  I was the one who was sending out the invitations. 
So, there was a program that was going to take place two weeks after our SNCC 
conference at Vanderbilt [University], which is the same city, but it’s a white school.  Vanderbilt 
had a program called IMPACT that the students controlled.  And for their IMPACT symposium, 
they had four people they invited: Strom Thurmond, uh, Allen Ginsberg, Martin Luther King, 
and Stokely Carmichael, and they were going to come at separate times. 
So, Stokely was the chairman of SNCC, but our conference was two weeks earlier, and 
Stokely wasn’t actually coming to the SNCC, uh, it was called Liberation Is Coming from a 
Black Thing.  But the newspapers in Nashville went stark raving mad.  This was a time when 
Stokely Carmichael was being attacked as a – he needed to be retroactively, his mother should 
take retroactive birth control, or he should be this, or can we deport him, because he was a native 
of Trinidad.  So, uh, all this hostility about the IMPACT symposium that he generated, the state 
legislature wanted the students not to invite him, and they refused. 
But Fisk, a black school, decided that they would kick us out, that we couldn’t have any 
rooms on their campus because our organization was an organization that Stokely Carmichael 
was the chairman of.  So, I was at Nashville with George Ware and Ernest and other students 
who were preparing the conference [laughs] when they decided we couldn’t have the rooms.  So, 
here we are.  We have all the people coming and no place.  And the other problem was that there 
was a blizzard.  It was Easter weekend of ’67.  There was a blizzard that shut down all the 
airports in the East Coast. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11

JM:  Can I, can I ask something?  Right up – 
JB:  [interjects] 
JM:  Uh, we’re – 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re back. [1:00:00] 
JM:  You’re about to get to that, to those days in Nashville.  And I want to ask this, as 
best you can recall, if you can conjure this from this distance.  What would have been, in say 
these months in early ’67, what would have been your, broadly speaking, kind of where your 
mind was, your frame of mind about the struggle about the nature of American society as you 
were continuing to examine and think about it? 
KC:  Can I finish? 
JM:  Oh, I’m sorry.  Please, of course.  Please, please. 
KC:  No, what I’m saying I’ll give you this narrative, and then I can do that very easily. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah. 
KC:  Um, because it was all in flux.  But, um – okay, um, so let’s start back. 
JM:  Fisk disinvited. 
JB:  Yeah, they had just taken your rooms away. 
JM:  They had taken your rooms away. 
KC:  So, here we are with all the students on their way, and our conference is collapsing, 
because now our speakers aren’t going to come, because they can’t.  They’re gonna – not fly in.  
And we have one speaker, Eldridge Cleaver, who can come because he arrives from California.  
And, um, the students there were well-organized, and they were able to get Father Woodruff, 
who was the pastor of an Episcopal church that was right on the edge of the campus.  It wasn’t 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 30 of 57 
 
controlled by the campus.  He said we could have our conference at his church.  So, we had a 
site.  Eldridge Cleaver was coming; we had a speaker.  And so, we were okay. 
I was sitting there, retyping the agenda, [laughing] changing all the rooms, changing the 
speakers, when Eldridge Cleaver was brought into the room where I was typing.  And he was our 
savior.  He was wonderful.  We had a speaker.  We were having a conference.  And, from what 
he said, he took one look at me, and it was love at first sight.  But it wasn’t love at first sight for 
me.  I saw this giant standing in a doorway, all the way to the top.  And he had been out of prison 
about three months.  And he had this very, sort of masklike expression, no expression.  He was 
just sort of standing there.  And I would say he looked pretty – well, I don’t want to say 
intimidating, but he could have been intimidating. 
So, um, he kept asking me things about could I get him a room, could I get him a 
typewriter, could I do this, could I do that?  Like, he kept trying to engage me.  And I didn’t 
know that he was trying to get my attention.  It never occurred to me that he was trying – 
Eldridge Cleaver?  [Laughs] Anyway, uh, eventually, it became clear that’s what he was trying 
to do [laughs] after the conference was all over.  And he didn’t leave, because he said he was 
doing a story about Stokely Carmichael, so he said he was going to stay and write about 
IMPACT. 
JM:  For Ramparts. 
KC:  And, um, I was going to stay and organize a fundraiser when Stokely came.  And, 
um, so he helped, he helped me, because I didn’t know how to drive and didn’t have a car, he 
helped me pull together all these details.  By then, I figured out he was trying to get my attention.  
He said it took him longer to get my attention than any woman in his life, [laughing] so, but, um, 
so then we – I noticed that he was very attracted to me and I was very impressed. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 31 of 57 
 
And we went to, came back to Atlanta and we sat down and played a game of chess.  And 
I beat him.  I don’t know whether he let me beat him, or if he just thought I didn’t know how to 
play, but George had taught me how to play chess, so I was – thought I was good.  Anyway.  
And then we fell in love, and the rest of history.  [Laughs] 
But, um, in terms of how I was thinking, Eldridge had, the, the, um, distinction of being a 
– what we called at that time black nationalist.  I think that’s probably somewhat misleading, but 
we used that term in a specific way, which meant an advocate of empowering the black 
community, repudiating racism, challenging all forms of injustice, and analogizing ourselves – 
this came a little later, but analogizing ourselves to colonized people. I’m on that path. 
But in Nashville, in Nashville a huge riot erupted after I left to go to be in a wedding, uh, 
April sixth, I believe, was the wedding.  And the conference had been like March 27th, 28th, or 
29th, something like that.  So, within a week of the conference, there was this huge uprising.  And 
because the Tennessee [1:05:00] legislature had been predicting violence – if Stokely Carmichael 
came, there was going to be violence – they got Michigan state helmets and training in riot 
control for their Nashville police, and they were so ready for this violence that they started the 
riot before [laughs] Stokely Carmichael got there.  I think it was some kind of little, um, a fight, 
a fight or a conflict at a bar sparked it, and then it went on for days. 
And so, the sense that we would fight, we would have to fight, we’d have to defend 
ourselves, we’d have to be armed, we’d have to learn about guerilla tactics – all that was coming 
into play.  But it wasn’t – it hadn’t crystallized.  This was ’67.  Uh, I’d say by the time Martin 
Luther King was murdered in ’68, it – that attitude had crystallized already among the black 
revolutionaries.  And I’m – I would say that when I first went to Barnard, ’67, no, ’66, in 
January, not January, September of ’66, I don’t think I would have called myself a revolutionary. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 32 of 57 
 
But then, I would also not have – I would not have been able to tell you that in January of 
’66, when I was a sophomore at Barnard, that I had all the preparation to become a revolutionary.  
It was sort of, it was just a matter of a few more pieces of experience, a few more pieces of 
information, which, once I met Eldridge Cleaver, who was a revolutionary, who was actually 
Marxist, although he kind of kept that to himself, but he was a Marxist and he had ideas of 
revolution and organization that were more, um, more radical in some senses than SNCC, uh, 
given he was with a more, um, um, basically, a revolutionary Marxist model.  That was what was 
in his head.  Um, and he saw the potential in the Movement in the South, and he was originally a 
Southerner. 
So, but he and I fell in love, and he wanted to, um – what did he say?  He wanted me to, 
uh, come and visit him, because, once he was in Nashville during this riot, and he was a person 
who had just been released from prison on parole, his parole officer made him come back 
immediately and said he couldn’t go anywhere outside the city limits of San Francisco.  [Laughs] 
That was his restriction.  So, in order for us to have a relationship physically, I would have to 
actually enter into the city limits of San Francisco [laughs], which I did later in July, after our 
summer – the conference was in March. 
We had all these student groups come, and it was an amazing collection of groups.  One 
of the groups was the, um, student union from Cornell, the ones who became famous with those 
photographs coming outside of Straight Hall with the guns, that student group from – I think it 
was African American Student Organization. I’m not sure of their actual name, but the black 
student group at Cornell was there.  There was a black student group from Berkeley.  There was 
groups from Roosevelt University. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 33 of 57 
 
It was a very, um, self-selected group of radical students that came there.  This was not 
like the popular thing.  This was the radical thing.  This was – actually it was dangerous.  I never 
really thought of the Movement as dangerous.  I guess if you commit to the Movement, you 
accept that danger.  That’s part of the price.  But the danger is just because you are challenging a 
tremendously powerful and injust society. 
So, in terms of the broader, the broader range, SNCC was like a debating society, or like 
an ideological institute, as well as an activist group, as well as like a family, as well as, uh, civil 
rights organization.  So, to think of SNCC as a civil rights group is not adequate; it’s inadequate.  
And also it was a phenomenon.  It calls itself an organization, but it was right: It was 
“committee.”  There’s a difference between a committee and an organization.  It was a 
committee, and the personnel would fluctuate, and you would have different emphases. 
So, by the time I came into SNCC, which is ’67, it was a Black Power organization in 
transition to, probably, a revolutionary movement, but it was not going to be in that movement as 
an intact organization.  And I didn’t understand that, [1:10:00] but I was in the midst of all of 
that.  So, I was absorbing so much.  I was learning all about the thinking behind Black Power and 
the argument that – the first argument that I got was Stokely’s letter, uh, not letter, the article he 
wrote, “What We Want.”  You know, um, during that time of the Civil Rights Era, leading up to 
the mid ’60s, that was always the public question: “What do you want?  What do you people 
want?  What is it that you want?  What is it you want?”  So, when Stokely started saying, “We 
want Black Power,” you know what?  They stopped asking.  [Laughter] Nobody asked anymore. 
[Laughs] Um, and he wrote an article.  It was called “What We Want,” [laughs] and he 
articulated the view that – he said that, um, “The issue – integration does not deal with the issue 
of poverty.  It only deals with the issue of color.  But the problem that the black community faces 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 34 of 57 
 
is the absence of power and the absence of institutions.”  And he said, “You cannot have a 
legitimate social change when you say, ‘In order to have a good school, blacks have to go to a 
white school.  In order to have a good – be in a good neighborhood, blacks have to go to a white 
neighborhood.’”  He said, “Integration is disintegration.” 
And it was very clear.  I mean, now people can look back and say, “Oh, yes.  He was 
right.”  But at the time, that wasn’t obvious.  I mean, so, now integration is almost never 
mentioned.  I mean, there’s something that’s no longer segregation, but certainly this is not an 
integrated society.  It’s a society that has eliminated official segregation.  Um, at least in practice, 
in practical things, they haven’t been able, in my view, to eliminate the intellectual or emotional 
underpinnings of segregation in people’s minds, either black or white.  I mean, and so, that’s 
probably because it was instituted too long. 
And, um, so, [sighs] being in SNCC was a precursor to becoming a revolutionary and 
being able to come into the Black Panther Party – I didn’t come into the Black Panther Party 
because I decided I wanted to be in the Black Panther Party.  I went out in July to visit Eldridge 
Cleaver and, um, [laughs] when I got there, he said, “How long can you stay?”  And I said, “Oh, 
maybe a week, ten days, or whatever.”  He said, “They’re going to have to send Willie Ricks out 
here to get you back.”  [Laughs] And so, I ended up staying there, basically, through August. 
And, um, there was a little light, small riot in San Francisco that summer.  Maybe it 
lasted like a half a day.  And, um, that kind of rattled Eldridge.  He just didn’t want to be on 
parole.  He didn’t – he felt constrained.  He wanted to go to Cuba.  And so, I had met the Black 
Panthers that he was not supposed to be visiting because he was – not only was he on parole.  He 
couldn’t associate with people who were armed, and the Panthers were an armed organization.  
But also their office was in Oakland, and he was instructed not to leave the confines of San 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 35 of 57 
 
Francisco.  So, as soon as I got there, he drove me over to Oakland [laughs] to meet the Panthers, 
um, and the Panthers a lot of times would come to his house.  And, um, it was the Summer of 
Love.  That was 1967. 
And so, what I’m getting at is that notions of revolution hadn’t really crystallized as 
much as they did later by ’68, after King’s death, and into ’69.  And by then, there wasn’t really 
any SNCC, and people had stopped talking about civil rights, uh, because the Civil Rights Act 
had passed, uh, and they were – there was this interest in electoral politics that attracted a certain 
group of, uh, of activists.  But then, this interest in organizing the community, the urban 
community, that was the movement that SNCC inspired but didn’t, um, it didn’t, um – how 
would I put – it couldn’t implement because it had, because it was a committee.  [1:15:00] 
So, it put out ideas.  It put out people.  I think, for example, Bobby Rush, who was one of 
the Black Panthers’ leaders, and Bob Brown, another one of the leaders, in Chicago had been in 
SNCC.  I had been in SNCC.  Uh, I think Joudon Ford, one of the leaders of the Black Panther 
Party, early leader in New York, had been in SNCC.  And, in Chicago, not Chicago – in Boston, 
the first, uh, chairman for the, deputy chairman for the Panther office there, Panther Party there, 
was Chico Neblett, who was a Freedom Singer.  So, you see this gravitation through the vehicle 
of Black Power into what we later called “Black Liberation,” or “Liberation Movement,” in that 
era of ’68, ’69, ’67, ’70. 
And that was when I was most involved in the Black Panther Party, and left the country 
in ’69.  And so, the process of my involvement in, direct involvement, in what was going on in 
the United States, was somewhat altered by Eldridge’s decision, once he was arrested in a 
shootout after the Oakland police – it was a shootout with Oakland police, in which one Panther 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 36 of 57 
 
was killed and I think about eight were arrested, including Eldridge.  And he was the only ex-
convict in the group.  So, he was put back in prison.  His parole was revoked. 
He was able to get out in June of 1968 on a habeas petition, which was unbelievable.  It 
was just totally unbelievable how that happened.  But it did happen.  He got out.  He was 
nominated, uh, the presidential candidate of the Peace and Freedom Party, uh, although he 
wasn’t old enough to have his name on the ballot, [laughs] um, and Soul on Ice came out earlier 
that year.  So, his – sort of his start was very big in the notion of challenge, Black Power, 
revolution, and those things seemed to be extraordinarily threatening to the larger society, which 
enabled the FBI and the government to demonize us, and it was okay to put us under attack. 
So, that was the, the direction I was heading into, and in terms of our broader world 
outlook, it was very heavily influenced by what was happening in the Vietnam War.  Uh, that 
was the proof: That was the evidence of the United States as an imperial power.  We could see it.  
We could see them sending troops to a foreign soil to shore up a government that, that was a 
puppet and to stop the Communists, who had won, and prevent them from – so we were in this 
world that’s similar to what’s here now. 
But it was – you know, a lot of deception, lies, confusion, hiding the ball, not telling the 
truth – but the media, the press, the newspapers, in terms of the Vietnam War, were more able 
than currently to give the story, because they had actual physical reporters physically going into 
the battlefield with the soldiers and filing reports.  And we could see TV, we could the war, we 
could see the massacres, we could see horrible, horrible things.  My daughter was telling me – 
my daughter is now forty-one years old, but at the time she was in elementary school, and she 
said, “That was traumatic!  We would see this stuff on the news!  It was horrifying!” 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 37 of 57 
 
So, you know, maybe it was horrifying to her, but to us it was evidence.  It was evidence 
that the United States was an imperialist power, the United States was reckless, the United States 
would disregard human rights.  It was proof that the things they were doing to us they do outside.  
But the other part of that, and this is the important thing for us, the revolutionaries, is that the 
Vietnamese showed they could be defeated.  And they weren’t rich and they weren’t powerful.  
They were organized.  In fact, I heard a comment that General [Võ Nguyên] Giáp was reported 
to have made to, uh, an American during the negotiations at the end of the war.  And he was told, 
“But we won every battle,” and he said, “And it didn’t matter.” 
Because the Vietnamese understood the politics of liberation and they understood the 
dynamics [1:20:00] of the use of knowledge, of propaganda, of organization – they presented 
themselves in a way that, essentially, most countries supported Vietnam.  Even if they weren’t 
pro-Communist, they supported the Vietnamese claim for independence over the American claim 
to dominate.  So, we were in that mode – which, even, even Martin Luther King came out and 
denounced the Vietnam War.  So, we were in a mode in which an anti-imperialist upheaval was 
triggered by Vietnam, sort of right as the Black Power Movement exploded. 
JM:  Can we pause here for a minute? 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We are rolling. 
JM:  We are back after a short break.  [JB coughs] Ms. Cleaver, I wanted to – um, you 
mentioned that you want to come at a further part of our conversation by, by, around the notion 
of community revolution. 
KC:  The way the Movement has been taught has been problematic from my perspective, 
uh, particularly in the way certain terms are used.  Let’s, for example, talk about integration.  
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 38 of 57 
 
Um, the effort to put an end to the segregation of schools was not, as far as black communities 
were involved, a move to integration.  It was a move to eliminate segregation, to stop the 
oppressive exclusion.  Now, you could stop the oppressive exclusion several ways: stop being 
oppressive, stop being exclusive, fund the black schools wherever to the height, which is one of 
the choices. 
But integration, like merging these very separate societies, was a – seemed to be a 
government idea, but it did not come from the black community.  It did not come from the black 
movement, you know.  Ending racist terrorism, ending racist exclusion, is not necessarily 
integration.  So, there was a problem there, the thinking of how we were going to go about our 
struggle.  And now, in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and in the areas that it 
worked, they were dealing with local people, local communities.  And in many cases, the 
communities weren’t terribly well educated or weren’t that wealthy.  And so, you rarely ever 
heard this word, “integration,” in those communities. 
But what was going on, in reality, was all over the United States, poor people who were 
black, and largely a lot of black people were able to pull together after a long period of small 
steps that exploded up with the success of the bus boycott in Montgomery that stimulated all 
over the country people to take action, not people whose names we know, but people who lived 
in this town, who had helped in some other program, churches.  There was a groundswell of 
activism going on across the United States, a process that I like to define as “community 
revolution.”  It was done by communities in communities, and these communities could connect. 
And I say that because the way in which the Civil Rights Movement is, has been – I don’t 
know if it’s still – has been presented academically as a good movement until King died, and 
then a bad movement afterwards.  And why is it bad?  Because it’s black, it’s not for integration, 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 39 of 57 
 
it’s calling itself Black Power, and that’s anti-white.  And so, [sighs] you know, this effort to 
protect what is white is really problematic, because the real issue that we have been struggling 
with is the profound hatred, resistance, rejection, and destruction of black people and black 
communities.  That’s anti-black.  That’s anti-life.  That’s antisocial.  That’s – that’s horrible! 
So, the black communities who under segregation – and the whole country was 
segregated, not just the South – the black communities under segregation developed mechanisms 
of survival and communication and how to manage.  And there were leaders who evolved in all 
these communities, and many times the leaders were women.  And when [1:25:00] the Brown 
decision happened, and there were so many organized efforts to change these horrendous 
practices, the people who were willing to take steps into the Movement began to become 
predominant.  Because before, I’ll tell you, when – early ’60s, late ’50s, a lot of black people 
referred to the Movement as That Mess: “You don’t want to get involved with That Mess.” 
And so, as younger people in the communities, who were willing to do it, got older and 
then a few more people got bolder, you saw, as the ’60s progressed, more and more sort of 
standing up and challenges, and you saw a plethora of organizations.  You couldn’t go to 
community that had black, a significant black community, population, without finding a lot of 
organizations, except perhaps maybe in a place like Oakland. 
You go to Oakland, there weren’t many organizations.  There were some.  There was an 
NAACP maybe.  There was one, but there were – it was just not a well-organized community.  It 
didn’t have the structure of churches.  It didn’t have the structure of black colleges.  And so, it 
had an openness.  It had an openness that – I loved it!  When I saw this, it was like, “No one’s 
organized here.” 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 40 of 57 
 
And so, there was this enthusiastic group of people who were young, who had been 
watching television, and they’d heard about the Movement, and they were willing to do 
something, and those were the young people who flocked into the Black Panther Party in 
Oakland.  Some of them told me, “Oh, that was the thing to do,” to go to the demonstrations.  It 
became popular to be a Black Panther, and people wanted to be Panthers – young people wanted 
to be Panthers.  They wanted to come to the rallies.  They wanted to learn this.  And, you know, 
some of them actually joined the Movement, and some of them were just influenced by it. 
But what I wanted to say is it was a process by which communities that were working 
class predominantly, not highly educated but educated to some extent, and aware, and knew that 
[laughs] the country was talking about them.  And then, those were the communities whose 
children were being shuttled off to fight in Vietnam.  I mean, all the – not all, but the vast 
majority of soldiers were teenagers taken out of high schools out of poor neighborhoods.  Very, 
very few college kids went, because they could get exemptions.  And so, that destabilized a lot of 
communities.  And then, the return to communities of heroin-addicted soldiers and people who 
had horrendous traumatic stress issues and who weren’t victorious heroes, um, was devastating 
in a lot of ways – when I say “devastating,” I meant the way it harmed the community. 
So, the – to talk about civil rights as if it’s separate to Black Power is a mistake, in my 
mind, that the issue was how do poor people, black people, excluded people organize themselves 
so they can empower and gain recognition, gain political voice.  That’s kind of what we were 
doing.  SNCC people were doing it in one way.  SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference] was doing it a different way.  The NAACP – the NAACP is actually doing 
something else, because it’s elitist, in the sense of elitist legal action, the NAACP Legal Defense 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 41 of 57 
 
Fund, whereas the NAACP was more of a membership organization, but they had very distinct 
limits as to what they would and wouldn’t do. 
So, we have a spectrum of organizations, and you’ll see – for example, one of the most 
powerful, dramatic, inspiring leaders the Black Panther Party ever produced was Fred Hampton.  
Fred Hampton was in the Youth Council of the NAACP.  He was a leader there.  I found out that 
Fred Hampton was a leader when he was in elementary school.  Fred Hampton found out that 
there were kids in his elementary school who didn’t get any breakfast.  He invited them to his 
house.  He fixed breakfast for them!  I said, “That’s amazing!”  [Laughing] This is a man that 
later joins an organization that actually has something called “Free Breakfast for Children,” but 
he was thinking that way before he ever heard of the Black Panthers. 
So, we have this upsurge of energy, of ideas, of possibility in this world in which 
colonialism is being repudiated in Africa, it’s being repudiated in Asia, uh, there’s movements, 
uprisings in Mexico, in Brazil.  Now, they’re not all successful.  In fact, most of these [1:30:00] 
uprisings aren’t successful.  But China – 
JM:  Yeah. 
KC:  That revolution was a success.  Cuba – that was a success.  So, the sense that it was 
possible for ordinary people to make a fundamental difference in their life – we had proof that 
that could happen, we had opportunity to make it happen, and we had an energized group of 
young people and some middle-aged people and even some old people.  In the Black Panther 
Party we had, like, one member who was, like, in his fifties – just one.  [Laughter] 
But what I’m saying is that there was this energy circulating through the community.  
Sometimes it’s called Civil Rights.  Black Power was more confrontational.  And just because a 
person didn’t go to the Black Power rallies or didn’t wear African headdresses or didn’t say 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 42 of 57 
 
“Soul brother,” that didn’t mean that that didn’t affect them.  So, we’re having a cultural process, 
an educational process that was influencing our community. 
And I think, by consequence, it was influencing the way the larger white community 
perceived the black community.  Now, the more friendly types, they perceived this as probably a 
good thing, but that’s the minority.  The vast majority of whites just know about black people 
from what they read in the papers, and the papers were slanted.  The FBI was writing all kinds of 
horrible things about the Panthers, or not the FBI was writing – the FBI had reporters on the 
major papers who would write slant stories and they would plant stories and they used – this is a 
term that’s called black propaganda, you know, use the media to demonize people improperly. 
And so, um, the fact that the Black Panther Party, which was started – I’m talking about 
the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which was started in Oakland in, um, October of 1967 
[JM: 1966?] – no, I’m sorry, October of 1966.  It was started on October 21st, because that was 
Bobby Seale’s birthday.  He said he remembered coming home after writing up – he and Huey 
[Newton] had written up their Ten-Point Platform and Program, and he went home, and his 
brother said, “Surprise!”  [Laughs] It was his birthday!  So, and the Black Panther Party for Self-
Defense took that name, “Black Panther,” from the Lowndes County group. 
The Lowndes County group called itself the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, 
LCFO, but the logo was this panther, and the media called it the Black Panther Party.  And so, 
then they started calling it the Black Panther Party and said, “Pull the lever for the Black 
Panthers.”  So, what I want you to see is here are people in Alabama have a Black Panther Party, 
and people in Oakland have a Black Panther Party, and they are in communication, even though 
they are not trying to do it the same way.  And there were other Black Panther parties, and this 
name “Black Panther” became part of the symbol for Black Power. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 43 of 57 
 
[Sound of sirens in background] 
But then, there were other groups.  For example, in Kansas City, a group was 
consolidated that joined with the Black Panther Party, and Pete O’Neal was the chairman of this 
group.  And then, um, there was some dispute, which I don’t know the details of, some dispute 
between Pete O’Neal and Oakland Panthers, so he pulled his group out and said, “We’re going to 
call ourselves the Sons of Malcolm.”  And so, you see these formations all over the country in 
urban areas that involve black men and black women.  You also see the Nation of Islam, which 
was much more conservative.  You see black elected officials, gaining. 
So, there’s a ferment.  There’s a ferment going on.  And then, also, there’s young white 
activists with the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], a huge student organization, and the 
anti-war movement.  Now, the anti-war movement kind of consolidates all this, because they’re 
– well, it’s actually the anti-draft movement, but they called it the Anti-War Movement, [laughs] 
mobilization against the war.  Um, that was being inspired, in part, by what was happening in the 
black community.  And, of course, there’s tensions, and at the time, it didn’t seem that it was so 
effective. 
But the FBI and the intelligence agencies were – they were going crazy.  And part of the 
reason they were going crazy, in my opinion, is because the United States during that period was 
also at war.  So, that’s a different intelligence national security issue.  What was happening, they 
were at war with Communists.  [Sound of sirens in background] And all of these groups, like 
Stokely Carmichael, who’s the chairman of SNCC, he goes to visit the Communist Castro, and 
the Black Panthers go to Canada and have meetings [1:35:00] with these Communist 
Vietnamese.  You know, so like the United States has genuine enemies.  And they are sort of 
using their attitude toward their enemies to paint the Panthers, who are too radical for them. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 44 of 57 
 
And also, they want to get – I’ll give you an example.  I was, “lackeys” was what I was 
going to use, but what they want is their advocate.  So, a good case of what I’m talking about is 
when Malcolm X goes to visit Africa.  He makes a visit to the Organization of African Unity, 
and he speaks there, and he visits several heads of state in Africa.  And that’s written about, and 
we read about it and we’re very proud of Malcolm X.  And he comes back and he talks about 
Africa.  He talked about the interests; he talked about colonialism. 
So, what does the United States government do?  They find James Farmer, who was the 
head of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and they send him to Africa, because they don’t 
like the fact of what Malcolm was doing in Africa.  They don’t like the alignments that Malcolm 
is making, so they want to have their own version.  And so, we see that.  Like, they’ll have – they 
want a counter.  So, if SNCC becomes exceptionally radical, they’ll find ways, “Well, how can 
we fund this or arrange this so we have a counter?”  So, these are the kinds of things that were 
going on, and that’s understandable politically. 
Then there was another secret level of what was going on with the intelligence agencies, 
with the FBI and the, um, DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency.  
One of the things that they were worried about was any potential alliances between black, what 
they called black militants, African revolutionaries – African and Arab revolutionaries.  This was 
something they were very worried about, because that, sort of like, then it’s like not containable.  
So, they wanted to be sure that didn’t happen.  So, I happened to be married to Eldridge Cleaver, 
who went to Cuba and then to Algeria, and we set up an international section of the Black 
Panther Party in Algeria, with the support of the government there.  And what we were doing, we 
were meeting the African [laughing] and the Arab revolutionaries and, you know, organizing – 
so we were going completely counter.

Now, for the FBI and the CIA and these intelligence agencies, we have become, um, 
well, enemies, but it’s worse than that.  It’s, it’s – [sighs] how did they call it?  “Key extremists” 
– they had lists of “key extremists.”  They had a whole counter intelligence operation targeted to 
every form of activism that they disagreed with.  So, there was a COINTELPRO for feminism.  
There was a COINTELPRO for New Left students, a COINTELPRO for the Socialists, a 
COINTELPRO – it started out back in the ’50s with the Communist Party, which got to the point 
it was a joke in my household.  Every third person in the Communist Party was working for the 
FBI.  [Laughs] You know, they’re the ones that fill up the meetings!  So. 
Um, and so, the Black Party – the Black Panther Party came into existence in 1966.  
COINTELPRO Domestic, the FBI’s COINTELPRO against non- you know, something more 
than the Communist Party, came into existence in 1967, I believe.  And they – one of their key 
objectives was to prevent what they said, “the rise of a black messiah that could unify the black 
masses.”  So, this means that they’re looking at what’s going on in our community revolution, in 
our civil rights, in our Black Power – they’re looking at it as a political problem and they’re 
singling out the people who they think would be the most problem. 
Now, who they listed at the beginning was, uh – oh, they said there’s, uh, Elijah 
Muhammad, but he’s a little old.  Now, Malcolm X is already dead, so Elijah Muhammad, but 
he’s old.  There was Max Stanford, who was the head of Revolutionary Action Movement, 
which was the underground group in, based in Philadelphia.  There was Stokely Carmichael, 
head of SNCC.  And, uh, there was Martin Luther King, who they were really, really, really 
worried about because, well, King didn’t alienate anyone, and he drew millions and millions of 
people, and he had a Nobel Prize.  He had, uh, much more worldwide admiration than any of 
these other people on their list. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 46 of 57 
 
And then, there’s – they didn’t even have the Black Panthers in there, in part because the 
Black Panther [1:40:00] Party was collective in the sense that we didn’t ever have just one 
leader.  We’d have a whole committee of leaders.  And then, every group that was organized, 
every chapter, would have, you know, like a deputy minister of defense, deputy minister of 
information, communication secretary, education secretary, minister of culture, and, you know, 
and then captains.  And so, it was a structured group that – this structure, this leadership structure 
would be duplicated. 
And what the government found out in their first efforts – because usually they see black 
organizations that are confrontational and radical and say, “Oh, we’ll just get rid of you.”  And 
the way they’re going to do it is scare you or kill you.  [Someone coughs] So, they tried.  They 
tried killing Huey Newton, and he just got wounded and ended up in a shootout, and a policeman 
ended up dead.  So, they said, “Okay, we’ll convict him of murder.  That’ll do it.  He’ll go to the 
gas chamber.  That’ll be the end of Huey Newton.”  So, when he was arrested and charged with 
murder, this was in 1967.  It was in October, I believe, toward the end of October.  It was a few 
weeks after Che Guervara was found killed and murdered in Bolivia. 
And, um, what we did – and when I say “we,” it was a small handful of people, maybe 
eight of us, decided that, um, at my suggestion, that we have to have demonstrations at the 
courthouse.  This was not something the small group of Black Panthers – they weren’t into 
demonstrations.  That wasn’t their thing.  But I said that, well, I understood that demonstrations 
are a way to protect you against violence and also to help build, uh, support, to bring support into 
the organization.  [Sound of sirens in background] So, now they’re faced with a need to protect 
Huey Newton from what might happen, and we organized and participated – we started out with 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 47 of 57 
 
about eight people and ended up with an international movement, uh, by the time his case went 
to trial. 
Um, and that is the kind of activity that frightened the government.  That was the part I 
think I didn’t understand: that the government was frightened; the police were frightened; the 
FBI was frightened.  They had never encountered agitated, armed, angry, intelligent, articulate 
black people standing up and telling them what they would and wouldn’t do.  That’s not an 
experience they knew what to do with.  They had that experience.  Colonial regimes had that 
experience.  And, as I’ve studied other movements, I see, you know, like, there’s the early phase, 
the people who are the most like the colonialists, and they want the, you know, legal rights.  And 
then ultimately it goes to a mass movement, and then ultimately it goes to guerilla warfare, and 
then it goes to independence.  And then, it goes to neocolonialism, [laughs] unfortunately. 
But, but, what I’m saying it was a world process that – the FBI and the intelligence 
agencies and their counter intelligence programs put us in that warfare context that they had 
been dealing with that we didn’t know about.  I should have known a little bit, but I didn’t, 
because my father was in the government.  But I wasn’t – I mean, I was a kid – I wasn’t paying 
any attention to what he was doing until much later, and then I said, “Oh, my God!  He was 
doing all these things.”  This was very political.  I mean, he was helping the United States 
government put an end to Communist uprisings in the Philippines and do community 
development.  And so, I guess, we were – 
JM:  [Sneezes] Excuse me. 
KC:  We were sparks in a movement that was much bigger than what we actually 
understood.  And it was – to us, it was the most extraordinary, exciting, and wonderful thing that 
we could do.  And we also knew we were risking our lives, but we did it – we wanted to do it.  
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 48 of 57 
 
We wanted to make sure that these conditions had to come to an end, and we were going to put 
an end to them or we were going to die trying.  And that’s an attitude that is, uh, frightening to 
people in authority. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JB:  Let’s take a pause here. 
JM:  Okay. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  Okay. 
JM:  I want to ask a couple of things, and you’ve spoken to them in some measure 
already, but, but maybe if you can focus in and just illustrate in one or two examples.  I’m so 
struck when I think about your arrival in late ’67 in Oakland, and you’ve mentioned, obviously, 
that, uh, Huey Newton’s arrested already and, and on a capital charge.  Um, all of what will 
happen there in what really are not too many months before – 
KC:  Gosh, very fast. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, there’s a swirl of things happening.  The ideology of the party is going 
to move through [1:45:00] these nuanced but very significant transitions, if you stop and think 
about – 
KC:  Yes. 
JM:  Their implications.  Um, it’s quickly internationalized in its focus.  Um, the pressure 
from law enforcement through COINTELPRO, it’s just, it’s just ever-present and massive.  Um, 
uh, and you’re a very young person who becomes in many ways part of the apparatus to explain 
all of this – 
KC:  Um-hmm. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 49 of 57 
 
JM:  To report all of this, to speak all of this. 
KC:  Well, you said I was very young.  To the Panthers, I was older.  One friend of mine 
said – she was in high school.  Most of the Panthers were high school age.  And she came from 
Chicago to Oakland, and I think she was seventeen.  And she said, “Oh, Kathleen, she was 
twenty-two.  She could be a leader.” 
JM:  I’m interested in how, um, if you can illustrate, the – that climate.  And you’ve 
spoken to this already, but I’m thinking particularly the difficulties of trying to carry forward a 
broad progressive political program through the locus of the Black Panther Party at a time when 
the police pressure, the criminal police pressure, basically, is just smashing down upon you. 
KC:  [Sighs] Now, you want me to articulate that process, how we were doing it, and 
what it was like? 
JM:  Kind of how to ma – you said earlier, another time, you just, you just pressed 
forward. 
KC:  Yeah. 
JM:  But I – 
KC:  Okay, let me, let me – 
JM:  This wasn’t the – 
KC:  Let me think about this, because what the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense – it 
started with a small group of maybe four – well, it actually started with two, two guys, and then 
another one joined, and then a girl joined.  So, it started very small.  It was local.  It was only in 
Oakland.  But the concepts it began with were for the entire black community: We want power to 
determine the destiny of our own community. 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 50 of 57 
 
And when you look at the Ten-Point Platform and Program, it’s essentially a reform.  
And it’s analogous to all the other sets of demands – if you look at the points that they raised in 
the Atlanta Student Movement: We want an end to police brutality.  We want them to employ us.  
We want them to stop not letting us try on clothes in department stores.  I mean, the different – 
when you look at colonial statements of the independence desires, when you go back to the 
colored people’s conventions at the end of the Civil War, you’ll see – “Well, what do you want?”  
“We want to be treated the same as whites.  We want to be able to own land.” 
Essentially, the Black Panther Party was a twentieth-century version of the hopes and 
demands and desires of an oppressed black community, rearticulated in a new set of words.  And 
the young people who joined the Black Panther Party were young people, like me, who had seen 
civil rights activists being attacked, being beaten, being killed – people the same age as 
themselves or younger!  And so, that had a huge, huge effect.  Many people that I met who are 
older than me told me that what made them join the Civil Rights Movement was the murder of 
Emmett Till.  But that happened in 1955.  So, it was the people who were Emmett Till’s age, 
who were fifteen or fourteen in ’55, those are the ones who went into – and they went into the 
Civil Rights Movement because there wasn’t any Black Power Movement yet. 
So, the kids who came into the Black Panther Party are a little older and they – one of the 
dynamics that’s intriguing to me is that so many of the urban areas, if you talk about, let’s say, 
Philadelphia or New York or Chicago or Los Angeles, the black population, the working class 
black population in these big cities, has a large number of migrants from the South.  So, you 
have children whose parents left the South, or grandparents left the South, who may have family 
still in the South.  So, when you see these demonstrations, like, people watching what’s 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 51 of 57 
 
happening in Birmingham, that affects them in a way that it doesn’t affect, let’s say, somebody 
just watching on television.  It’s not just news. 
It’s – first of all, it’s traumatizing to see these people being beaten.  And I remember 
Emory Douglas, who grew up in, uh, uh, Michigan when he was young, before his mother 
moved to California, he said, “I didn’t want that to happen to me!  [1:50:00] I wouldn’t let 
anybody beat me like that!”  And so, you have this edge.  You say, “Well, this is what they did 
to, you know, girls and boys who just went out and protested.  You know, they beat them, they 
chase them, and they sicced dogs on them.”  So, you have anger to resolve or rectify this kind of 
violence and also this sense of, “I wouldn’t let anybody do that to me!  If they come and push me 
around, I’m fighting back!” 
And so, when the Black Panther Party took the position, as in the name, Black Panther 
Party for Self-Defense, there was automatic response, “That’s right!  We can defend ourselves.  
We should be able to defend ourselves.”  Now, if someone was growing up in Mississippi, first 
of all, they’re not even going to hear about the Black Panther Party.  And secondly, this whole 
idea of being able to defend yourself, everybody knows it but doesn’t anybody talk about it.  So, 
you had a generation who sort of threw off the caution of their parents and were thrust into the 
middle of a county at war, the Vietnam War.  And if they were younger, that’s why the age – 
they were too young, in many cases, to get drafted.  They were fourteen and fifteen and sixteen.  
In fact, some of them were thirteen.  We didn’t really like to have thirteen-year-olds.  And then, 
there were those who lied and said they were older. 
But the Black Panthers were largely a youth movement.  And youth have several qualities 
that are distinct.  One of them is they believe they are immortal.  And so, even though it’s 
[laughs] very, very, very dangerous, what we were doing, it was like, “Okay!  I’m going to go 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 52 of 57 
 
get my gun, and we’re going to duke it out!”  It’s like they didn’t really think – and I’m trying to 
think myself, “Did we really –?”  It’s sort of like I know people are going to get killed.  I know 
that.  I know I might get killed, but that didn’t function as a deterrent on us.  Now, that does 
function as a deterrent for most people. 
So, what you have with the Black Panthers and a similar group is a radical, committed, 
dedicated group of young people who are collected.  They’ve collected together, and that’s a 
huge energy.  That’s that collective communal energy, and they represent adults who aren’t 
going to join the party, but who are going to help them and support them.  And they also, 
because the Panthers ran out there the way they did – [laughs] I’m quoting from, um, a woman 
who is, Assada Shakur wrote about in her book, uh, her autobiography. 
This was when she was being, um, her picture was being circulated all over New York as 
a person who was wanted for bank robbery.  But she didn’t know that [laughing] that they were 
going to put her picture in the paper that day because she had – she wasn’t actually the person 
who robbed the bank.  But that’s who they were looking for.  So, she, um, goes by her apartment 
and she sees police all over it.  So, she says, “I can’t go there.”  And she goes to a friend.  She 
says, “Nobody knows that I have this friend.  Her phone number is not in my address book.  So, 
I’m going to go to her house.”  So, she goes to her house, and the girl says, “So, what took you 
so long?”  [Laughs] 
So, that’s what I meant, that there are people who are observing this stuff, who will help.  
They’re just not going to let it be publicly known.  And then, there are people who can’t help but 
be involved, and those are the people the FBI just messed over, like your parents or your 
neighbors or your friends – call them up, “Have you seen them?  Where are they?  What can you 
tell us?”  And that’s to alienate those people from you.  Uh, I’m trying to think of something – 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 53 of 57 
 
who was that, a cousin of mine?  It’s something I just heard recently.  They found out that so-
and-so was related to me.  We’re cousins.  I think our – my father’s side of the family is related, 
through that.  And he had some kind of security clearance in the Navy and he was called in 
because they found out that he – you know, these are the types of things I don’t even know were 
going on.  I discovered my son, Maceo Cleaver – his name is in the Mississippi Sovereignty 
Commission records!  They’re spying on my son!  I don’t think my son has even been in 
Mississippi. 
Well, I don’t know – but what I’m saying is that the level of surveillance and – what do 
you call it?  [1:55:00] See, we’re getting back now to the nature of a slave society, the society in 
which – um, how did they put it?  A South African, a South African, um, sociologist said, “It 
practices,” and he was describing South Africa, but you can use this for the United States: “It’s a 
society in which there is democracy for the whites and tyranny for the blacks.”  And so, the 
political system that black people are subjected to does not have the liberty or the freedom of 
motion or the freedom of access that the whites do.  And then, [sounds like something hits 
microphone and sound levels change] when they start acting like they do, or that they ought to, it 
becomes very frightening.  So, we were setting off fears that we didn’t quite understand. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JB:  I think she lost the microphone. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
KC:  But we, when, um, when I’m done with this. 
JB:  Okay. 
JM:  We’re back for a final kind of question.  Ms. Cleaver, I want to just invite you to 
comment on the following.  We’re at, uh, we’re at forty-plus years distance now from the late 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 54 of 57 
 
’60s.  And, um, we’re able to talk about all of this with that much space in time that has passed, 
and I think that probably in significant ways changes even the moment of explaining it.  There’s 
– I think in this context of things I’ve read that you wrote in those years – 
KC:  At the time? 
JM:  At the time. 
KC:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  And the immediacy and the rawness of it. 
KC:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  And the urgency of it and the ugliness of the things you had to talk about and 
describe to make known what you were confronting. 
KC:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  And at this distance, even when we talk about horrible things that happened to 
people that we knew, that you knew, there’s just enough remove somehow that I think the 
emotional character of the telling is a little different.  I wonder.  So, I want to ask you to reflect 
on that: If the distance has changed the way we talk about this, and, if it has, what that means for 
how we try to recover that history.  That’s one broad thing. 
The other thing, too, is – before we started today, um, we touched on the fact that there is 
a film now kind of coming into circulation, The Black Power Mixtape [The Black Power 
Mixtape, 1967-1975], um, and it’s engaged by different people in different and interesting ways.  
And so, is it nostalgia?  Is it historic interest?  Is it – why do these things resonate the way that 
they do in different audiences? 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 55 of 57 
 
So, two broad things: What the passage of time has meant to the way we think and talk 
about these things, and how we – in the specific case of this documentary, how it plays to today’s 
audience? 
KC:  At the time when these police raids were an everyday occurrence, and Panther 
offices were getting bombed, and people were being followed and shot and arrested, there’s a 
newspaper cover of one of the issues of the Black Panther newspaper – I think it’s a 1970 issue.  
It’s something about “Fascism in America,” and you open it up, and there’s just page after page 
after page after page of arrests, records of arrests, who was arrested, what they were charged 
with, where they were – like Mumia Abu Jamal, one case in point, comes from Philadelphia to 
Oakland.  He’s arrested for jaywalking, [laughs] because he’s a Black Panther.  He’s a teenager!  
He’s got a picture – the Philadelphia police have a picture of him, and I think they give it to the 
FBI – a teenager!  A teenager who made a speech at a rally, wearing a black beret, against the 
Vietnam War – and the FBI’s picture, they wrote a number and on the back “dead.” 
So, the hatred and hostility of the law enforcement community and the FBI, I think, was 
more exaggerated  than maybe the general population, but that was the element that we kept 
referring to as the – well, Huey Newton called them the “racist dog police” or the “Fascist 
police” or the “imperialism” – we were engaged with them at the time.  They were engaged with 
us.  It was a war.  It was what you call low-intensity, counter-insurgency, warfare techniques 
being targeted toward us. 
But we were revolutionaries and we believed that it would come to war and that we will 
take that risk.  And so, I think that has something to do with the tone of how we expressed 
ourselves, the things that we wrote about in our newspapers, and the attitude, because so many 
people were going to jail, going to prison, getting arrested.  It was, [2:00:00] it was, it was 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 56 of 57 
 
overwhelming to a certain extent.  It wasn’t overwhelming when we thought of what we wanted 
to see happen, our vision for America. 
Uh, and in the distance, when you come back now, I think the fact that, um, so many of 
the people who made that time, who led that time, whose voices, whether they were speakers or 
whether they were leaders or whether they were artists or whether they were singers, like Miriam 
Makeba, or maybe, uh, Ossie Davis, or Stokely Carmichael, or Eldridge Cleaver – all these 
people are gone.  They’re all passed away.  And so, the, the intensity that we had at that time has 
diminished somewhat because we don’t have that collection of powerful, brilliant, artistic, 
committed people.  We don’t have that collection anymore.  I mean, just imagine all those people 
who were together at the same time! 
Suppose – okay, let’s talk about people who were killed and suppose they weren’t.  Let’s 
say, suppose Bobby Kennedy wasn’t killed.  Suppose Malcolm X wasn’t killed.  Suppose Martin 
Luther King wasn’t killed.  Suppose Fred Hampton wasn’t killed.  And suppose the 
organizations that all those people represented flourished.  Then, we’d be talking something – 
we’d have a different outcome, and we’d be talking in a different way, and we’d be a different 
country.  So, they were killed, so we aren’t going to be that different country. 
And I think that’s – probably has something to do with why that – the images in Black 
Power Mixtape are appealing to people, because I think, you know, the opportunity to be that 
country is gone.  However, when you watch Black Power Mixtape, it looks like [laughing] it’s 
still a – it’s still possible!  And everyone is young, and Angela [Davis] is so smart, and Stokely is 
so charming.  And it’s engaging.  People were engaging.  Even though it’s a very threatening and 
dangerous time, the personalities were engaging, and they were upbeat.  Like, almost all the 
pictures you see of Stokely Carmichael, he’s got his gorgeous smile.  He’s got a beautiful, 
Kathleen Cleaver Interview, 9-16-11 
Page 57 of 57 
 
beautiful smile.  And [laughing] people also were young.  They’re just young and full of 
hormones and excitement and, you know, [laughing] we want to have a revolution, but we want 
to go to a party, too, you know!  And we want to get married and we want to have kids!  Eldridge 
used to say, “They’re just wasting our time!  Let’s get this stuff over with, so we can go back 
[laughs] to enjoying our lives!” 
JM:  Yeah.  What a privilege and an honor to be with you!  Thank you so much for – 
KC:  [Laughing] Okay. 
JM:  Having us here today.  Thank you. 
KC:  Oh, thank you.  Does that work for the black –? 
[Recording ends at 2:03:09]
