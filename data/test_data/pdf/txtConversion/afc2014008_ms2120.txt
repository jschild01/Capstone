ARCHIVES AND ACTIVISM;  Aspects of
  
Reciprocity Between Scholarly and Local Communities
  
Southern California SEM Mtg.
 
Northridge,  CA
 2/22/97
 
What  I intend to try to do this afternoon is to consider
 
a few of the particular ways  in which archives can be useful
 
in university teaching as well as  in relations with the
 
surrounding communities.  And since  I am not an archivist  -
-
 I
 
just  like them -
-
 I will have to be  somewhat  discursive  in
 
explaining why I feel this way.
 
When  I had the honor of addressing the national meeting
 
of the Society for Ethnomusicology a few years ago,  I pointed
 
out that  I am an extreme example of that tiresome phenomenon
 
-
-
 the person who wears two hats -
-
 although sometimes  I feel
 
like an entire  shop window of chapeaux -
-
 for the
 
ethnomusicologists have been kind enough to invite me in too.
 
But the fact  is that when  I began teaching at CStJN in
 
the Music and Anthropology Departments  some thirty years ago,
 
it gradually worked out that  I taught mostly folk music and
 
folklore.
 
And I came to my  job from a particularly specialized
 
Position.  Both my father,  John A.  Lomax,  and my older brother
 
Alan were  folklorists and important  intellectual  leaders
 
during the great period of folk music and folklore collecting
 
of the 30s,  40s and 50s.
 
As the youngest  child in such a family,  my understanding
 
of what  folklorists actually did was to record,  set down,
 
transcribe,  copy,  quantify,  research,  analyze,  comprehend and
 
eventually publish,  the generally old but always  shared
 
traditional repertoires of stories and songs -
-
 the artful
 
things that everybody in a particular group know,  or at  least
 
know about.
 
Since you may not have had a folklore course recently
 
(or perhaps you are  simply folkloristically challenged)  let
 
me  remind you that the really interesting and useful aspect
 
of  folklore  (which always  includes  folk music)  is that  it  is
 
there. It doesn't go away,  at  least in terms of its formal
 
structures.  Current data networks may provide us with
 
information as to birth rates,  agricultural yields,  hurricane
 
routes,  whatever,  all of which are necessarily changing
 
according to international pacts,  migration patterns,  the
 
prevailing winds,  and so forth.  But the traditional self
  
portrature of a particular group whether through tale,  dance,
 
proverb,  craft,  song or all of the foregoing,-- it has a much
 
longer shelf life,  so to say.
 
And it  is almost  impossible to destroy.  Whole empires
 
have taken unsuccessful shots at  it -
-
 the British in
 
Ireland,  India,  the West  Indies;  the Chinese  in Tibet;  the
 
United States  in Hawaii and other Pacific Islands.  You  just
 
about have to wipe out the whole population before you can
 
wipe out their traditional  identity mechanisms,  although they
 
they certainly can be distorted or denigrated.  But the way
  
they do things:  tune an instrument,  tap their feet,  use their
 
diaphragms,  play a scale -
-
 those are there.  
A Navajo third grade teacher,  a Ralphs boxboy,  a Marine
 
colonel,  an Amish housewife.  Any member of such a group knows
 
-
-
 or knows of -
-
 an assemblage of expressive behaviors that
 
go with that particular identity.  Each one will also likely
 
be a member of another folk group,  if not  several others,  and
 
will thus  share multiple repertoires.  And a very few will
 
have dedicated themselves to the best possible performamces

or presentations of their culture's culminating art  forms.
 
And you know,  I can't  see that this general description
 
varies  in any fundamental way from the the career choices
 
American culture provides  for our budding young concert
 
artists.
 
But  let's  see if I can bring this back home  for a few
 
minutes,  as  I used to try to in my old CSUN Folklore classes
 
-
-
 make you feel this all around you,  make you hear the music
 
when there isn't a performance.  Suppose you were sitting in a
 
restaurant and there was a bustle near your table and a
 
gaggle of waiters  started singing "Happy birthday to you".
 
Most of us at  least  in the nearby tables,  I believe,  would
 
sing along,  going "happy birthday dear uhm uhm,  happy
 
birthday to you".  I always do,  and it tends me to make me
 
feel wide-ranging and generous and happy.  But actually,  why
 
do  I do that?
 
It's not  as though I join  in public singing often;  in
 
fact,  there is very little public singing in today's United
 
States to  join into.  Church hymns are the best possibility,
 
but most  congregational singing other than by African-
American worshippers  is pretty wimpy.  At ball games there is
 
sometimes a chance to tackle the National Anthem but most
 
people chicken out.
 
Actually I sing "Happy Birthday to you"  in restaurants
 
to people  I don't know just because it  is what ordinarily
 
friendly English-speaking people who live in the
 
States do.  They also say "starlight,  starbright,
 
see tonight" when the  first star comes out of an
 
United
 
first  star I
 
evening,  and
 
they pull apart the turkey or chicken wishbone and argue
 
about whether the long or the short end gets the wish,  and
 
they worry about  stepping on the  lines on the sidewalk,  and
 
they think that a college class has to wait ten minutes  for a
 
tardy professor and fifteen if
 
-
-
 lives are full of pattern.
 
So in a sense folklore is
 
group all know without exactly
 
it.  But to turn it upside down
 
commonalities are a large part
 
And ironically the notion
 
she  is a PhD.  Their -

these unappreciated

of communality was one of the
 
characteristics of folklore and folk music that my students
 
hadtrouble with.  They wanted to deal with something new,
 
unheard-of,  individualistic,  special.  They kept on feeling
 
that group information was  somehow ordinary -
-
 oh heavens
 
maybe trite.  They wanted to discover something -
-
 maybe the
 
only singer in the entire United States who knew a version of
 
Child #? When  I pointed out to them that  such a discovery
 
certainly could be exciting,  but  it also indicated that very
 
few people had had any particular reason to remember that
 
particular song,  I felt  I was  somehow muddying their shining
 
vision.  And I suppose,  if  I were young again,  I might agree
 
with them.
 
And I had to admit that most  folk music builds on the
 
formal structure typical of its own folk group.  A corrido can
 
have new words and be  sung to a new tune but  it  is  instantly
 
recognizable as a corrido.  Lovely problems to chew over

Now,  I had challenqed students right  from the beginning
 
of my teaching at CSUN to do their own folklore and folksong
 
collecting.  Since  I had grown up believing that collecting
 
folklore  (songs,  tales,  riddles,  proverbs,  beliefs,  tunes,
 
techniques,  etc.)  was what  folklorists did,  I believed my
 
students had to learn something about how to do that.  So from
 
my very first tentative academic semester,  I included an
 
optional collecting project  in the course syllabus,  and later
 
made  it a requirement.
 
There were ground rules:
 
Students  could collect  from the following sources:
 
1
)  Themselves -
-
 their own experiences and
 
repertoires as members of folk groups.  When you interview
 
yourself,  after all,  you are setting up the most pleasant and
 
cooperative interaction you'll ever have.Nothing wrong there.
 
2)  You could collect  from relatives,  friends,
 
workmates,  classmates -
 people to whom you could reasonably
 
easily explain what you are doing.
 
3)  Groups with which you have no,  or perhaps
 
only secondary,  personal entree.  In such cases on-going
 
discussions with the professor were required;  I had no desire
 
to have my enthusiastic neophytes barging -
-
 without proper
 
invitation and preparation -
-
 into union meetings,  or Black
 
Panther gatherings,  or witch coven conclaves.
 
Lastly,  as far as practical,  students  should report
 
the current and historical context of the folkloric items
 
they collected.  Who  (and what kinds of whos?)  knew it? Where
 
had it been learned? When,  how,  and why had it been used? Was
 
it  in active or passive tradition -
-
 that is,  did people
 
actually know it or  just know about it?
 My earnest
 
recommendation was that  students press as  far as they could,
 
without being boring,  along these lines.
 
You are perhaps thinking that  I just put  in the
 
"without being boring" phrase to be funny.  Not so.  Any good
 
folkloric collecting project requires  some degree of
 
closeness and some degree of reciprocity.  I have told this
 
story before,  but never at  its source.  A good CSUN student
 
whose collection of -
-
 I don't remember any more:  baby games,
 
wart cures? -
-
 came to me and said,  "Mrs.  Hawes,  you taught
 
me how to collect,  but you didn't tell me how to stop
  
collecting.  I worked with this old lady who lives down the
 
block,  and she  just can't  seem to understand that my project
 
is  finished and every time she sees me,  she waves me over to
 
tell me three or four more  she  just remembered.  I' ve gotten
 
so  I go home through the alley just  so she won't  see me.  It's
 
getting embarrassing."
 
And I had to say,  "Well,  that's the way it goes.
 
You' re ready to move on,
 
lL) t

 cures ,
 
you share that  interest.
 
but  she thinks you really wanted to
 
and that you' re her friend because
 
You got your A;  now it's time  for
 
you to think about pay-back."
 
Indeed even the brightest  students had yet to learn that
 
in dealing with folklore,  you are asking people about what
  
they know,  what they have  learned or tried to learn. That is
 
a very different request than that of the field sociologist
 
or ethnologist who have to ask people about who they are -
-
personal questions about their parentage,  their children,
 
their habits,  their beliefs,  their political opinions and the
 
like
 Remember that  folklore is,  in one sense,  depersonalized
 
because  it  is group knowledge.
 
Generally,  people like to tell you what they know;  in a
 
way,  you' ve done them an honor to have asked.  And thus  in
 
dealing with folklore,  a subtle  intimacy between collector
 
 
4
 
and collectee can have formrned.  They begin to form a duality
 
within which the most tender and vulnerable qualities of a
 
person or a group can have been laid bare without anyone's
 
really recognizing it at the time.  As a project develops,  old
 
wounds may well be opened up.  Often at the end,  the most
 
suitable  recompense an outsider can make is to provide his
 
informants  (who will probably by then be his  friends -
-
 I
 
tried to warn students about this -
-
 maybe you don't want any
 
more friends?)  with copies of the texts and other materials
 
collected,  along with such historical or comparative
 
information as might be available as well as useful to the
 
informant.  Now that's a lot to ask of a sophomore.  But  it's
 
not a lot to ask of a a proper archive.
 
And as a relatively inexperienced teacher during
 
the  late  60s and early 70s,  I found myself ending every
 
semester with a stack of field research papers  full of real
 
information gathered by bright  students that  I had pumped
 
full of excitement.  It  felt  rude  just to give it back.  Our
 
relationship had by then become  semi-professional,  a bit like
 
that between dirt archaeologisxts and their student diggers,
 
I should imagine.
 
So,  we  set up an Archive -
-
 one drawer in one file
 
cabinet.  It was a simple receptacle in which we kept the
 
folkloric materials  students were bringing in from their
 
course field investigation assigments.  And as always happens,
 
as we thought we were  solving one problem,  we were
 
simultaneously creating new ones.
 
What  if the student didn't want to contribute to a
 
file that  anybody might  look into? This one was easy -
-
 they
 
didn't have to;  no questions asked,  I just gave them back
 
their project with comments,  grade and all the rest.  But what
 
about the people who had contributed their memories,  story
 
and song repertoires,  talents,  bits of personal history et al
 
to a student and thereby to a strange  institution like CSUN?
 
How would they feel about glimpses of their personal lives
 
 
a
 
being available  for  just anyone who happened to pull open a
 
file drawer?
 
This was trickier and took  longer to resolve,  if it
 
ever truly was.  Generally,  I told students who were
 
interviewing single individuals to ask for their permission
 
to retain the material in the CSUN Folklore Archives.
 
Students usually made this  request after the project was
 
completed,  since if there was an objection,  all they had to
 
do was tell me and the relevant materials would be returned
 
forthwith.  As you can see,  this whole operation started as a
 
teaching tool.  And doggone,  it was a good one.  It got
 
students more observant of their own life styles by the
 
classic anthropological technique of comparing their lives
 
with others.
 
And as time went by,  I drafted a letter on CSUN
 
stationery thanking those especial informants  (
I do wish
 
folklorists would come up with a less perjorative term)  for
 
their especial  contributions to research.  And students have
 
seen that  letter framed and hanging on the wall in Valley
 
homes.  I wish I had thought to start to do it sooner.
 
And in the case of group data -
-
 jump rope rhymes,
 
sorority songs,  camp songs -
-
 where no individual was
 
identifiable  I did not require institutional approval for
 
archiving the material;  the student collector would have had
 
to receive permission to record it  in the first place.The
 
CSUN Folklore Archive contains a plethora of such material.
 
And so here we were with a bedlam of conflicting types
 
of data -
-
 individual biographies,  group chants,  ballad
 
versions,  you name it.  We had to have  some principles for
 
sorting all this miscellany out and,  for better or for worse,
 
we early on established the idea of function as a primary.  We
 
would look first at how an item functioned within its
 
community in the most obvious ways.  If,  for instance,  a
 
rowing song consisted entirely of religious verses,  we would
 
still classify it as an occupational song.  Eventually,  we
 
would hope to cross-file  it  (if the time ever came for such
 
an academic luxury)  under religious song.
 
Now you must realize that all of this  just happened
 
because  it happened.  Who knew what would be coming down the
 
road?  Initially,  with the  sterling assistance of my friend
 
and associate Barbara Rahm,  I just wanted to set up a system
 
through which student contributions could be  located.  And
 
that was what the Folklore Archives at CSUN amounted to at
 
first.  But they grew and they kept on growing;  every
 
semester.they grew more,  and they grew more complicated as
 
well.
 
For example,  CSUN education students assigned to
 
classroom and playground supervision,  were able to observe
 
child lore on the hoof,  so to say,  in terms of traditional
 
rhyming.  But to catch the truly enormous dimensions of this
 
particular data,  you must visualize a single clothes  line
 
reaching from San Diego,  Cal±fornia.to Augusta,  Maine.  And
 
any folklorist  can assure you that all the children along
 
that rope will be  jumping to one variation or another of the
 
same ten or maybe fifteen rhymes.
 
It's not because they haven't any other possibilities.
 
Roger Abraham's  remarkable DICTIONARY OF JUMP ROPE RHYMES
 
suggests  four or five hundred.  But -
-
Mother,  mother,  I am ill,
 
Send for the doctor over the hill
 
In comes the doctor,  in comes the nurse,
 
In comes the lady with the alligator purse.
 
is  just  so right,  so perfect.  I have no hesitation in saying
 
that every elementary age English-speaking child in the
 
United States knows that  rhyme in one variation or another -
-
and nobody taught  it to them.  And no one has yet come up with
 
a workable hypothesis as to why.  If we understood the
 
universal appeal of those  four lines,  would we understand
 
something particular about the way childrens'  minds or
 
memories  or rhythmic responses work?  I really don't know,  but
 
I do believe that  such data is more  fundamentally reliable
 
than that generated by most questionnaires and tests.
 
The  folklore archives at CSUN,  because of the then-
current emphasis on elementary education,  include more than
 
jump rope rhymes,  more than
 clapping games,  more than
 
ball bouncing rhymes.  Their complex verbal,  musicological and
 
sociological structures plainly deserve more than the casual
 
academic scrutinies they have received.  Many people collect
 
them,  for they are undeniably charming,  but very few really
 
think about them.  They are  so trivial.  But they sure do
 
n
i
 
endure.  And how many things that you know last that long?
 
Another usage for the CSUN folklore archive has stemmed
 
from the requirement that  folkloric materials had to be
 
situated in a human context.  The rhyme,  song,  poem,  tale -
-
all were unacceptable  for our archives without at  least a
 
brief mention of the human surround within which they had
 
thrived and been remembered.  Such a requirement elicited the
 
occasional history of the  individual singer,  the teller,  the
 
instrumentalist,  as well as the particular circumstances
 
surrounding the tale,  the  song,  the composition.  Such
 
information not only validates but can add a richness to even
 
the most  everyday materials.
 
I have myself written three folklore  journal articles
 
out of CSUN Folklore Archive materials -
-
 "La LLorona in
 
Juvenile Hall" based on a student  social worker's collection
 
of ghost  stories told her by Juvie inmates;  "The San
 
Francisquito Dam Break:  the Story of a Local Corrido",  a
 
disaster ballad,  and a third which evolved directly out of
 
the act of archiving a student's  contribution,  a lullabye her
 
mother always  sang her:
 
There was a girl  I knew by the name of Slewfoot Sue.
 
She was chief engineer at the shirttail factory
 
Down by the riverside view.
 
Her form was all she had
 
She had a face  like a softshell  crab
 
Every night  she would tussle with her patent  leather
 
bustle
 
Gee whiz,  she was bad!
 
Now you see what a pickle  I was  in with this  song.  If I
 
held to the functional principle of the archive,  Slewfoot Sue
 
had to go in the file of lullabies,  but  it  looked so silly.  I
 
looked around in other people's archives -
-
 notably Alan
 
Dundes'  at U.C.  Berkeley --and I found that their lullabye
 
collections tended to be pretty scatty too -
-
 unless they had
 
censored them.  And that led me to do a paper  (Folklore and
 
Function:  a Look at the Lullabye)  examining why American
 
babies tend to be put to sleep with a disorderly amalgam of
 
hymns,  old college songs,  pop tunes and the occasional bit of
 
Brahms.
 
In a final example of archive usage,  my then graduate
 
assistant,  Barbara Rahm,  who had nobly filed millions of
 
superstitions,  decided to look at pregnancy beliefs during
 
the period between conception and delivery to see if she
 
could make sense out of them.  Which she forthwith did,  after
 
examining parallel data from UCLA's Dr Wayland Hand's
 
archives.  It was a fine study -
 her MA thesis -
 and I
 
recommend it not  just to folklorists but to birth clinics and
 
neonatologists.
 
Now I guess archiving must kind of run in our family,
 
because  I happen to have a son and a daughter-in-law who
 
jointly have initiated and built a local historical archive
 
on a far-northern campus of the University of Maine  .Note
 
that CSUN has a folklore archive inside its Urban Studies
 
Archive;  other places have other kinds of archives with
 
different  contents.
 
Ny son and daughter-in-law have gradually created a
 
home there for land-use documents,  family bibles,  historical
 
letters,  ancient contracts,  as well as  such odd-ball cultural
 
items as the occasional locally-composed song about a local
 
event.  The latter they have transcribed,  translated,  and sent
 
to the local newspaper with such historical  information as
 
they could add.  And it has turned out that those  songs have
 
been the  first  items that the local newspaper has ever
 
regularly printed in French,  the everyday but officially
 
scorned local  language.  (As my son once put  it,  in Fort Kent,
 
you buy your gas in French but you go to school in English.)
 
And here we come to a critical aspect of the
 
archive as a structure,  which makes  it,  I believe,  especially
 
suitable  for publicly supported colleges and universities.
 
Libraries  (which I adore),  no matter how outgoing
 
and community oriented,  generally contain materials that come
 
from everywhere and are thus generally available everywhere.
 
Archives,  on the other hand,  come out of particular sources
 
that are generally not available elsewhere.  Overall,  such
 
sources tend to be local,  including material unique and
 
appropriate to the particular community.  It  follows then that
 
their primary users mostly tend to be  local.
 
My son's and daughter-in-law's archive -
-
 The Acadian
 
Archives/Les Archives Acadienne at the University of Maine at
 
Fort Kent has become a community resource for evidence  in
 
land rights disputes,  a site for researchers all the way from
 
local high schoolers to international scholars from Quebecois
 
Universities, as well as a community repository for valuable
 
documents.  A resident  recently turned over to the archive a
 
land grant  signed by Louis the XVIth which had been handed
 
down in his family for generations.
 
For you see archives depend for their contents on people
 
putting things  in there;  such a trustful relationship has to
 
be developed with the users of the archive.  And this is why
 
my little thank you letters to the informants who had worked
 
with my students was  impressive to them.  For archives fail or
 
succeed on the basis of what has been put in them and whether
 
or not people can get that  informaton back out again.
 
Although the very word -"Archive"  sounds ultra-academic,
 
archives are essentially structured for community
 
participation and reciprocity.  And that is why I titled my
 
remarks Archives and Activism.  For unless you put your mind
 
to  stopping it,  there  is no way that an archive doesn't
 
interact with the community it's  in.  It's  just built that
 
way.
 
Let me summarize.  Libraries contain widely distributed
 
15--
'
J I
  
information,  but archives contain information not 
A available
 
elsewhere.  Archives depend upon the contributions of some
 
part of the local community,  and act also as a distributor of
 
this  information.  Therefore,  the relationship between the
 
university,  the archive and the community must always be
 
reciprocal.,
 
Now before  I close,  I want to  just mention that the
 
actual act of archiving -
-
 the identification,  categorizing,
 
and sorting out of such materials is an education in itself,
 
and the more students  I could involve
in this,  the better.
 
And then  I want to say just a few words about music
 
archiving.  We didn't do so well with music in the CSUN
 
Folklore Archives,  and I wouldn't want you to expect what
 
isn't there.  (On the other hand,  wouldn't  it be nice to try
 
to improve it? One of the nice things about archives is that
 
they are never finished.)
 
But when we were setting up the CSUN Folklore Archive
 
ion the  1960's.  tape  recorders weren't that easy or
 
inexpensive to get hold of and most people didn't know how to
 
use them well anyway.  (The quality of tape was poor too and
 
we didn't know much about  storage.  We have found most of the
 
tapes we kept had deteriorated so much that they had to be
 
discarded).  And then very few if any students could write
 
music so some of our musical stuff is  just poetry.
 
So we did what archives always do -
-
 the best we could
 
with what people gave us -
-
 lots of parodies,  standard
 
oldies,  childrens  songs.  But we  failed to document the early
 
days of the great  immigrations  from Southeast Asia,  the
 
stunning repertoires being brought into the LA area by
 
immigrants from Mexico,  so manythings got past us.  You know,
 
Los Angeles could be a great center for the  study of local
 
musics and what happens to them when they are ripped out of
 
their home base and transported somewhere else.
 
I just give the archivists of the future one heartfelt
 
tip -
-
 don't ever  (no matter how beguiling and unique)  accept
 
a tape that hasn't been transcribed or at an absolute minimum
 
completely indexed.  I wish I had known that  forty years ago,
 
Thank you for your kind attention
 and the very best
 
of  luck.
