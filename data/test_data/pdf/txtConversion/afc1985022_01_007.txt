TEXT: 
GN: This has nothing to do with Yugoslavia 
MH: This is to help me learn about the marshes 
GN: I don't know anything about the marshes --
GN: This is the Barataria intercoastal waterway 
TT: Is it time for lunch yet? 
(This was a natural waterway -- it's been dredged and is now part 
of the intercoastal waterway -- they've dug a lot of dirt out to 
use for fill) 
GN: Was the steam shovel produced before the steam boat? 
TT: Huh? Actually there was a steam boat as early as 1815 
GN: Okay they must've had steam shovels to dig this with 
(there was a steam boat used at the battle of New Orleans -
the first use of a steam boat) 
MH: Is there any cypress here? 
GN: No, 
it's too high. We'll get back in where the cypress 
are. They tend to grow where the water's a little more stable and 
a little deeper 
MS: I suppose they coulda had steam shovels 
MH: What's the name of this canal 
GN: Kenta -- named after an earlier plantation. Local people 
call it Priest Canal, like a Catholic priest, cause
-a retreat's 
right around the corner. When I first carne, that road the bridge 
is on, Louisiana 301, 
for about the first two years I thought it 
was Osborne Road. 
It's not -- it's Isle Bonne. 
MH: I saw a picture the other day of an early house made of 
Palmetto Fronds 
GN: When we were coming down the road, that first 
development in there, Oak Forest, I'm not too sure that may not

have been =the site of the first Is leno group th at came up through 
here, because on all the earlier maps that was cleared and I 
don't know why anybody would have cleared it unless it was an. 
earlier site -- And see it's all on the old bayou de Famille, 
which is " Family Stream" --
(George is taking water samples) 
This is the Barataria Waterway which used to be a natural 
waterway that now is part of the intercoastal waterway -- you 
start at Corpus Christi and you can come all the way across -- on 
one of those bottles write today's date and put the location, 
write B1, 
and then do B2, -=and another one B3 --
GN: People live here all the time -- ( it isn't park property 
-- they fish, a lot of them work in town. Crown Point is over 
there, but this is also considered part of Crown Point -- up 
until they built this new bridge, prior to that they had a ferry 
that ran across -- even up into the 60s -- they guy who ran this 
drawbridge -- one of those table drawbridges -- was paid off by 
the barge people. He would leave it open for hours at a time. 
They intimate that the local people trying to get home from work 
would get so upset they would actually shoot at him. Knowing 
these people it could be. 
MS: that's where the new Creole Queen's sposed to stop 
GN: This is all our property. See the cypress trees are in 
here. It's a little lower and we would have ponds in here. This 
house right here belongs to a lady named Mamolo -- she moved here 
in the 1920s with her husband -- this piece of property was 
called the Inez plantation -- goes back to the early 1800s I 
believe -- they watched over that land for trappers, fishers, 
that kinda thing for years and years -- when they moved here 
their house was out on this side of the waterway 120 feet from 
the road -- see how much of it has eroded away. That's a shrimp 
boat. 
Marnolo has a life-long lease to live on the park property. 
Her maiden name is Hebert, same as her husband's, which is the 
original group, the oldest group that came. They just had their 
400th anniversary this year. 
When we get up in the park, all the trapping leases are 
active, we should find -- Frank ? I understand last Saturday he 
had a heart attack, so obviously he won't be out, but we should 
see probably one of the others. The park leases trapping grounds. 
Our legislation says that traditional uses will continue. That's 
one of the traditional uses. 
Just local people that live here -- some of ern have lived 
here for many, many years. The old fella that lives in that 
trailer right there's one of our trappers. Hiss narne is Lucien 
Buie -- about 72 or 73 -- has several girlfriends --
When the oil companies carne most of these people went to 
work for the oil companies, kinda have gone away from what they 
would have done -- it's been very important to them economically 
The ail companies have had an adverse impact on the 
Barataria region because of the dredging, the diggirtig of the 
canal= --
There's a great deal of controversy over whether when they 
originally drilled in the _ lake that they spilled a lot of the 
brine that comes up with the oil into the lake and salted, if you

,not sure ,t 
h'at's true. 
This is all considered Crown Point. It's an unincorporated 
little -- the town of Barataria in Lafitte is off to our left -
Barataria is supposed to be named after a mythical isle that 
Pancho Sanzo was made Prince of -- supposed to mean wilder ness. 
Lafitte named it that to give it a mystique that would discourage 
strangers from coming there from New Orleans. Supposedly they 
came in from th e la ke and through Bayou Cochille and then up the 
river 
(taking a water sample) MS comments that the water is very 
cold. " How else are you going to take a water sample, Mikie?" 
asks George. 
ON: This is a salinity sampling site. Eleven degrees 
centigrade. Salinity . 9. 
I gotta write thatidown in my little 
book. 
(Mike Strock sings " We wish you a merry Christmas" into the 
microphone) 
GN: The water's 51.8 degrees, Tom. Alright, we're going down 
toward Lafitte a ways. Now Jones Island used to be Jones Point. 
TT: We crossed that the other day in the plane. 
GN: Because of the size of the barges they couldn't make 
this turn, so they dredged it so they can go straight. We're now 
into Lafitte. This is considered part of Crown Point, but the 
mailing address is Morrero. 
I took pictures of the washover site the other day, and lost 
the roll of film. 
See this cemetery? That's very famous. 
It's been here since 
the beginning of time. Jean Lafitte may be buried there. But then 
again he may be buried in the one down the road. 
It's a shell 
mound also, see. Earthed Cemetery. ( I take a picture) 
MS: Lafitte's treasure's in there too. 
GN: It's under that oak tree. 
MH: What are those birds? 
GN: Those are eagles. Fish crows. I used to work in a park 
with a guy, everything too far away to tell, held - say, " Those are 
eagles." 
MH: Those weeds over there, are those phragmites? 
GN: Yes --
MH: What's the local name for that? 
ON: Giant cane? I think they call it 
MH: What is it they use for trapper's reed? 
ON: That's the original chimney of the Fleming Plantation. 
In fact somebody said it was part of the original building that 
Galvez build in 1728? 32? I don't know. 
No, they use Rozo ( sp?) 
cane, you're thinking of. That's a member of the hibiscus family. 
MH: To hold the traps down? 
GN: Oh, most of those they use pieces of wax myrtle, or 
young sapling re 
little fast. 
d maple, or what ever. Hang on, we're gonna go a 
"(engine revving) 
Be ready for B2. That's Lake Salvador straight ahead. 
MH: Are these water lilies around here? 
ON: Water hyacinth 
MH:'That's causing a problem around here? 
ON: Yup, 
but we got it cured. We have a biological control 
3 
LFPAMHOa7 
program going. We've got little fellows that came from the same 
places the hyacinths came from that live on them. They 9re call.ed 
Niocotina ( sp?) Their excrement actually kills them. 
One part per thousand. 0829. 
We gotta go down the intercoastal waterway and do one more.'— 
Then well go up into the park, Segnette Waterway, try and catch 
one of the trappers for you. 
This is not a natural waterway. They dug this. This was done 
by the corps of engineers, because the local people who fished 
would come down from Weswego, down Segnette waterway which is a 
bayou in the upper end. They had to go out into the lake and go 
down through. 
MH: That looks like a bus stop 
GN: Okay, here we go ( revs the motor) This was all 
subdivided. People were gonna build little cabins out here. 
(end of side one) 
4 
LFPAMH007 
SIDE TWO 
GN: Right in here you'll see as close to a traditional cabin 
as there is in the whole area. It's probably the only one that is 
close to what they traditionally looked like. 
It's made out of 
cypre_ks with a galvanized tin roof. 
MH: Groceries! 
GN: That's part of the boatbuilding yard. They're building 
that boat. That's a shrimp boat. We'll come back this way. 
MH: What's that stage for? 
GN: That's a marker that there's a tree stump 
MH: What are those birds? 
GN: This -- now this is Pipeline Canal. This was dug because 
it has a pipeline in it. 
MH: What kind of fish do people catch here? 
GN: Regular freshwater varieties. ( stops the boat) We got 
somethin on the crop. 
We're actually out into the marsh. This is intermediate. The 
salt may go as high as four parts per thousand, normally it's two 
to three, more or less. 
Now you need to start watching. See the nutrias? ( we just 
saw a belted kingfisher -- there is duckweed in the water, the 
world's smallest flowering aquatic plant) 
Duckhunters and 
trappers can't use the same territory. 
GN: We have decided that's not a good idea. 
MH: Is that full of three- square grass? 
GN: No, this is more duckweed, sagittaria, phragmites, 
MH: eelgrass? 
GN: no, that's more saline. Smartweed, as it's called. 
(GN identifies a warbler from the flight pattern. Too far to 
tell what kind) 
That would be a typical ' floton' ( French for floating marsh) 
the waterways within them are ' trainasses' --
"like finding the rugaru" 
This is the area giving us a lot of trouble because it's 
beginning to break up because we have water in here so much. 
(we stop for pictures) 
There's a marsh hawk straight out -- when we get up to the 
bridge we may be able to find some deer. 
MH: Do you have osprey? 
GN: One -- I've seen one every year for the last four years.. 
I think he just wanders through. 
MH: What do they call em? 
GN: Fish Hawk. 
There's a big hawk on the.- power line 
MH: Red shouldered? 
GN: Either that.or red tailed. May be a red tailed because 
of the size and the white breast. You usually see the osprey in 
the upper end of the park. He stays on this power line, but 
farther north. 
That's a red-tailed hawk. That's a big bird. Wz? got a lot of 
those around here. 
MH: are phragmites any problem down here? 
GN: No -- you would be moving from a saline to a fresh water 
marsh -- ( that wou ld ma ke it problematic for the salt hay farmer) 
5 
LFPAMH007 
-- here it's the opposite. 
That's an eagle. 
Once in a while one passes through. The nearest nest is six 
miles south of here. That's a turkey vulture. 
Your marshes are definitely saline marshes -- the 
marsh is much farther south of here. Toward the coast more. 
saline 
They call the wax myrtles mangroves here. Mangos actually. 
MH: Do they have a mosquito control program here? 
ON: Not out in here, no. They have it more toward 
developed areas. 
MH: Is that controversial? 
ON: Because of the chemicals used, 
is why. Just like the 
spraying of hyacinths. Where, the Interior, , we don't use almost 
anything. We've agreed that we could use roundup -- the state of 
Louisiana and even the Corps uses 24D yet. Now the corps still 
does a vegetation control keeping the waterways open, because 
that's their charge. They've agreed that they will only use 
Roundup in the park. 
It's not considered a detrimental use. Now 
we have people in the park Service that don't think we ought to 
use that. 
That's a honey locust -- most of these are black locust. 
These are little ponds in here. These are all gallinules. They're 
galliform. I think they've changed the common name of the 
gallinule. Now they call it a common moor hen. 
We have Least Rail --
(people hunt rail too) 
There's a big nutria. 
(we get out to investigate a pond) 
There's a couple of black neck stilts across the pond. No, 
I 
take that back. They're yellow- legs. I thought I saw a bunch of 
ducks when I first carne in, 
now I don't see em. 
MH: What's making that noise? 
MS: probably the rUgaru 
ON: That's probably the yellow legs. There's a killdeer 
there. 
(nutria scat) 
(bird sounds) 
TT; What are the gators doin this time of year? 
ON: They'll stay under in caves -- ( they don't hibernate in 
the true sense of the word) -- they'll stay under as long as it's 
cold 
the 
MH: What is this? 
ON: That's called duck potato. Sagittaria lattifolia 
The ducks really don't eat it. 
I don't know why it's called 
duck potato. 
MH: Is that an iris? 
ON: This is baccurus (?) here -- it's a disturbed area 
plant. During the depression when all the farmers lost their 
land, this is what came in. They call it depression plant. 
See, the hyacinth is almost impossible to kill, because the 
seeds are down in the mud. 
(back in the boat) 
The corps did about a ten year study of this little beetle 
-- it's from Argentina, the same as the hyacinths. The thing of 
6 
LFPAMH007 
P
I-
­
it is -- nobody was really satisfied with this program because''it, 
didn't work all that fast. But it beats spraying. Somewhere along, 
in here there's a bay tree, with cooking bay leaves, but I can't 
find the tree any more. 
(we hit a submerged log) 
ON: I hope we didn't break a prop. 
MS: Is this duckhunting season now? 
ON: There's no ducks here because our ecosystem has changed`
 
so much there's very little for em to eat. 
(a mockingbird) 
MH: Is there a lot less moss out here than there used to be? 
M : Yeah 
MH: Would you like to get more growing here? 
ON: Why? 
MH: I don't know 
ON: Local people want to come and use it far decorations -
no, 
in the areas where it's more predominant I think it's still 
enough in numbers -- we haven't been here long enough to see too 
many trends like that, but I have read that it's disappearing. 
It's probably the air pollution. 
That's a green back. They used to call it a little green 
heron, now they call it a little green back heron. 
(either a great egret or a snowy egret or an early phase 
little blue heron, because they're light. A red- tail hawk)

TEXT: 
MH: This is pretty back in here 
GN: It's kinda deep 
TT: Is that part of the contract that was Just completed? 
GN: Yeah, there ar e two br idges -- o ne there and one here - 
it's going to be part of our walking trail system -- this is the 
junction of Pipeline and Kenta Canal 
(walkie talkie sputtering -- park people re: details of 
construction) 
(a nutria slide) 
GN: That's typical of where nutria are going in and out of 
the water 
(immature blue herons -- greenish leg and black tip on the 
bill -- and immature ibis in a tree) 
(taking pictures from a marsh overlook -- built there as 
part of the bridge) 
GN: Watch out for snakes 
They're talking about having an interpretive sign on the 
overlook 
This is the interface between the marsh and swamp. This 
canal was dug to get the cypress trees out -- th ey took them up 
the Harvey canal to a sawmill -- something like a million board 
feet a year. 
ON: Mike knows where the logs are -- the sinkers -- what 
they would do, they would come out and girdle the trees, leave .em 
for 
.a year until they die, then they would come back and cut ern, 
and then drag em out into the canal. A lot of em didn 't dry out 
-- they were too dense and they sunk to the bottom . We dug a 
whole bunch up when we cleansed the canal out. Bayou Cochille used 
to connect with Bayou De Famille, so originally you could come 
LFPAMH008 
out of the river down Bayou De Famille, Bayou Cochille went
"all` {, 
the way out into Lake Salvador, but this all disrupted it. What 
we did, this was one of the fingers of it -- the other one came 
out and around, so we went back up and opened it as part of the 
canoe trail;°'and that's where the other bridge is. 
(a narrow- nosed toad, a cricket frog?) 
(back in the boat) 
GN: This little junction has in the past had a little family 
of otters that like to play around in here from time to time 
(When the water's down you can see the holes inthe bank 
that are nutria entrances -- occasionally you see an otter " roll" 
where he marks his territory) 
Cypress knees are an adaptive response -- that's the only 
way they can get air to their roots. 
In series of wet, wet years 
you have no new cypress because the roots are covered up. 
The shells that are natural that the Indians used for their 
mounds are in the lake -- this was dug through the marsh and 
wouldn't have the bottom. 
This is getting to be a favorite spot for birdwatchers 
GN: But until we took over and started controlling it there 
was so much shooting and dumping of garbage and everything, the 
birds just, the minute they saw anybody they were gone. 
We had an alligator nest in here for a couple of years. 
MH: What does that look like? 
GN: Just a mound of vegetation and dirt -- we had a bunch of 
little ones about this big. We had a guy from one of the tv 
channels come out and do a thing on our vegetation control, and 
we happened to find the little alligators that day. 
The vegetation control has been tried elsewhere. 
In 1978 the 
state and the corps dumped a lot of the little bugs west of 
there, " and we actually found bugs over here prior to us going 
into the program. The reason it hasn't been successful is it's 
really a slow process and nobody wants to accept the slowness. 
Nobody knows what will happen if the bugs ever control all 
the hyacinths -- will they just die, or will they go on to 
something else? Over the period of time it takes to get rid of 
the hyacinths they may adapt to something else. 
Four white poles together -- George's markers in a long term 
study of vegetation changes they are conducting --
GN: See those big logs? Those are all ones that were cut 
during the logging -- those are sinkers. The density was so great 
that they Just hauled em through deep waters -- see the holes 
bored in the ends? That's where they hooked the eyes to em and 
drug em. 
(We'd need more sunshine to see more nutria. but ` it' s not 
unusual to see a couple of hundred of them in there -- also lots 
of turtles, including alligator snappers. People catch therm using 
hooks. You can't use the same technique for alligator snappers 
that you would use far alligators, because the former won't come 
up out of the water.--
GN: They hang the bait for an alligator, and then when he 
come up through and grabs it they just lasso it, 
if you will. 
MH: Will you have interpretive materials about trapping? 
GN: Well that's one of the things we're having a discussion 
about, whether we want to do that or not, because of the, well, 
w 
LFPAMHOOS 
you know, people don't really consider that 
MH: The public-at- large isn't sympathetic toward trapping? 
GN: Yeah -- now what we've done is we've closed all of this 
side until we're about a quarter of a mile past thi* trai'1, and 
all of this side he can trap, but he has to trap on the back side 
of the levee, so the canoists won't see a little animal in a 
trap. 
This is all closed to motorboats. This is the Cochille 
trail, the only one that's handicapped accessible in the park. 
(Wheelchairs can go on it, directly from the parking lot) There 
will be guided walks along it. 
GN: It's kind of a neat walk really. It's an old -- the road 
was put in in the fifties -- 56 to 58 -- they actually dug an oil 
well out here, and that's what this was, an old road bed. So we 
just adapted it and made a trail out of it. 
MH: Do people use these palmettos for anything now? 
GN: No -- the only thing is they use em for Hallowe'en 
they'll make haunted houses. The volunteer fire departments -- we 
have no professional fire departments on the west bank -- it's 
all incorporated. They have some paid operators, but the majority 
that are involved are all volunteers, and one way of raising 
money is each year they have these haunted houses at hallowe'en. 
MH: Is this trappers' reed? 
GN: Trappers' reed? 
MH: Someone was telling me about something they use in 
trapping called trappers' reed -- like bamboo 
GN: No -- that's not phragraites, 
I'll think of it. 
GN: This is greenbriar -- it's common all through the south. 
This was a road that came all the way out here -- this was a 
bridge piling -- and they drilled an oil well. 
(it was dry) 
In the spring these are all irises. All of this in here is 
blue. We also have a red variety that is pretty rare. 
Nutrias eat bark, but George thinks it's a " boredom thing," 
not a nutrient problem. " A lot like horses in a coral -- they'll 
just eat on something." 
(we see two nutrias) 
GN: See those boards on the other side of this thing? That 
was an alligator pen. This guy used to keep alligators here. I 
think he sold em. They eat em here. 
MS: They eat anything 
GN: On the west bank you have to 
Danny Horton kept a couple of nutrias as
Ipets. They ran in 
and out of the 
house. 
There'll be a lbt of the year that people won't want to 
visit, because of bugs. There are deer in the park. 
MH: so you have all kinds of habitat in here. 
GN: It goes everything from the upland, which would be the 
natural levee all the way out into the marsh. So we've got em all 
right on this trail, which would really be good 
(end of side one)

SIDE TWO 
.•.MxPx:... 
GN: This is called " rattlebox" ( shakes some seed pods at`me) 
This is a wetlands indicator. Rattlebox or coffeebean, one or the 
other. No we gotta go all the way down Pipeline and then back up 
Segnette, because this guy has his gate up. We'll go up there and 
look at all the camps on Tarpaper Canal. ( so-called because of 
the shacks) 
Only some of them aren't exactly shacks. One is a lot nicer 
than my house. These are all on land that people lease. Year by 
year or five year -- and if you move you lose it. But they have 
electricity and everything. 
(A sign: " If I can't take it with me, 
I'm not going") 
GN: We don't have a large population of alligators because 
1 
they kill em all. 
It's legal to hunt them. 
(discussion re; digging out the Panel canal to make it a 
better canoe trail) 
GN: I'll show you the trail we built Cat the visitors 
center] That's a neat trail. 
I'm proud of that ane. That' s the 
neatest trail in the park. That and ring levee. I found that ring 
levee completely by accident. I was out there boondoggling around 
and I found it. 
(the bridges are very sturdy: " In about fifty years when the 
coast is up here, you'll be able to fish off of em. 11 ) 
MH: The Mississippi River is trying to change course? 
GN: It would if they would let it right now, but they won't 
let it. 
That river structure is there. About 30 percent of it 
goes down through the Atchafalaya now. 
If it was allowed to go 
down the Atchafalaya the port of New Orleans would be gone. There 
wouldn't be enough flow. Those big ships wouldn't be able to come 
in. 
Plus the salt block would move way up above New Orleans. 
There's a little marsh wren in this tree. Little brown bird. Cute 
little old bird. Right in this moss. 
Lake Ponchartrain is a spillway. When the river gets up so 
high that flooding of New Orleans is imminent, they release the 
pressure. But the diversion they're talking about would renourish 
a lot of the marsh we're losing. One of the diversions would be 
over here. The other one is down south of New Orleans around 
Violet. 
It probably would reduce the salinity levels in both the 
two lakes. 
term? MH: Would it make it roug h on some occupations in the short 
GN: Well it would move some oysterbeds farther south because-
of 
the salinity, and the fishing will change, but only in 
distance. The fishermen are against it because it's so easy 
they don't have to travel so far now. But in the long term it 
would be an advantageous thing. 
The oystermen al-e against it but they've begun to realize 
that the pollution of the water in this general area has caused 
them so much'trouble, and that would reduce the pollution and 
therefore enrich the oyster beds. 
MHz Do you burn off the marshes? 
GN: No -- there's a great dea l o f controversy as to whether 
that's really a goad idea. I don't think, for our area, we know 
enough about it yet to do it. They [the tr•appers3 do it simply 
because they need to get to the animals easier.

ON: Now, they do that in a lot of places. 
It may in time be 
something we want to do, but I don't think we know enough- about 
this area yet to do it. But a 11A of the -- Alan Ensminger ( sp?) 
who probably knows more about marsh management than everybody 
else put together, who worked for the state for years and years 
he's totally opposed to that. He doesn't think we ought to do i . 
MH: Is he a biologist? 
ON: When I first carne here he was the head of fur management 
and refuges for the state. Really nice man. He does a lot of 
consulting work now. The only thing is, 
if you get five of thes 
people together -- three that are academics, and two or three 
that are management, you get seven different ideas of what you 
ought to do. Like the canals. You oughta fill the canals back up. 
And another will say, no, you just plug ern off, the other will 
say leave em alone. Breach the levees and leave em alone. 
MH: Would people who have burned off the marshes for years 
-- are they putting up a fuss about all this? 
ON: No, because I don't think they're -- some of the places 
that do it ,lust go right on and do it, 
and the ones that disagree 
here and trap, will just flat do 
land that they trap on. They 
now -- the trappers who come out 
it. 
See, nobody owns most of the 
lease it from the landowner 
MH: Would the trappers that come out here on Barataria --
ON: They're not gonna burn, or they're not gonna have a 
trapping permit. Louisiana Land and Exploration Company owns 
majority of the marshlands in Louisiana. They will allow you 
trap their land for a percentage of what you make off of your 
for the 'permit process. 
It 
to know how much they get. 
the 
to 
a half per nutria, but 
year. 
to burn they would 
property that we ow 
to get to the 
MH: How does it help him get to the animals? 
ON: Well the nutria will come to the areas that aren't 
burned yet. What they'll do is they'll go through and block off 
the water coming out of these trainasses to hold water in the 
marsh so they can trap the nutria in the marsh. 
MH: The nutria will try to be where it's'"wet? 
ON: They'll come to the deep water because that's where they 
can get away. 
MH: See, I thought the burning had to do with firming up the. 
vegetation and the bottom 
ON: Well it would, under certain conditions, but if the 
water level's down too low it will burn it all -- because all of 
this is organic -- and then you'd wind up with absolutely 
nothing. It's like the Everglades. 
If t'he Everglades gets 
extremely dry and then burns, 
it burns everything. 
MH: I thought the three- square would be forced out by other, 
LFPAMH008 
vegetation -- because it's early in the succession : 
GN: But we're not trying to do that -- what we're trying" 
do is reestablish the vegetation by holding the water level -- in 
other words, what we want to do is manipulate the water levels. 
What's become evident to us is that in -- our problem here is 
that we get such a tremendous fluctuation in the water levels 
that the plants that require a certain period of dry and a 
certain period of wet have been excluded and we've got a lot more 
of the bull- tongue and things like that which are not a good 
productive grass -- that's the sagittarius -- duck potato 
MH: It sounds like there are a lot of ways to skin the cat 
GN: Well, no two people will agree -- see those guages that 
I have, if we got a tremendous rain, we migot have a water level 
of plus 2 point six feet -- a cold front will go through with a 
north wind, and the water will be reduced a foot, a foot and a 
half in a couple of days. So, see, this is what our problem is. 
We can't really stabilize anything. We think we can get 
this 
area to revegetate with more fresh related -- the idea is to put 
this place on an equibrilium where it will change as it naturally 
would, instead of this -- what's happening to us is changes that 
ought to take fifty, seventy-five, a hundred years are happening 
in five or six years. We've got what we believe to be a water 
management plan, where we would put devices in, 
and say, November 
through February we would leave the water level to go up and down 
as low as it would go. We also would have the ingress and egress 
of the marine organisms that use this area. Then, say in February 
or March we would put our stop logs in, raise the marsh water 
level up, then later in the year we would reduce it back down 
again. 
MH: So trappers managing marshes in St. Bernard have a 
different concept of what they're trying to get than what you're 
trying to get? 
GN: Well, not really. I think we're all talking about the 
same thing, 
but see, what happens to us, 
is a lot of places here, 
we went and visited two of the big state areas, a private concern 
area, managed Just for duck hunting -- the state area, 
I'm not 
really sure what they manage for, and the federal area is for 
wildlife, or for waterfowl. So, 
see, 
if we managed this for 
waterfowl we would do it differently than we would if we were 
managing it for the ecosystem. Or if you want to do it for fur 
production you would do it differently -- so, that's what our 
problem is. 
We're trying to manage an ecosystem, whereas 
everybody else has a specific area within that ecosystem. Like 
that Little Pecan Island, they definitely do it because they want 
waterfowl. So they keep their water levels up,""at a different 
time of year than we probably would want
,to, to encourage 
waterfowl. Plus they►ve gone back and they've planted.this -- 
they've got a ll ki n d of devices over there -- see what we're 
trying to do is preserve the fresh water flow that originally 
started off of the back of the natural levee -- and then she 
flowed all the way out into the lake. What happens now is it hits 
the canal, and boom, goes right down out of the canal. 
I did a very preliminary little bottle study, I used milk 
cartons --
1. 
I 
•%i 
GN: The state did a study, and they had readings of a 
hundred and fifty thousand colonies for a hundred milliliters'of 
water. The acce
il 
ptable level for recreational water is 200 
colonies . And Jefferson Parish has been sued by EPA and they keep 
getting rei•f`ieves, and they're supposed to, 
by 1988, have this 
cure. 
It's sewarage. They have a sewerage plant. And when it 
becomes loaded, they just bypass it! That's not uncommon 
knowledge . They just dump it. 
In fact I met an old man one day 
over in Bayou de Famille fishing -- it was a Saturday morning, I 
was Just fooling around, and we were talking about it, 
and I said 
we were trying to clean up the water . He said he had worked in 
that sewer plant for 23 years, and he said, " I honestly can't 
remember a day that we didn't bypass ," which is , you know -- my 
God! See , the problem is, we're inviting people to come and use 
these recreational waters. It' s amaz ing to me that [people 
haven't gotten sick] -- as old Fletcher says, "The solution to 
pollution is dilution," so that's what they do. That' s what they 
view marshes as -- a way to dump this stuff, but once they get 
their, act together with the sewers and get that treatment 
straightened out, a lot of these problems will subside . But the 
question I have is " When is the day the marsh can no longer 
accept?" And it will just die. And it will happen, I think. But I 
don't know when. 
If you look at it from a pure standpoint, there 
is no acceptable level, except 200 colonies per 100 milliliters. 
But I saw some readings one time that exceeded 300 thousand 
colonies per 100 milliliters. Now that's almost raw sewerage. And 
we find people up there fishing. Honest to God. And I've said, 
"You're not really fishing here," and then they get upset! " Of 
course I'm fishing here!" -
MH: Do they get sick? 
GN: No! Apparently not! See we've found that up in that area 
where the Prairie Producing thing went on, I had them do some 
ancillary studies, and we don't see the water coming into the 
park that back way. 
It goes down Miiladon into Segnette waterway. 
We 've had tremendous fish kills a couple times, but that's from 
another sewer plant farther up. 
I think that's what it is. 
They will never admit that, but I 
don't know what else it could be. 
It's not oxygen depletion. 
MH: What do local people say is causing the fish kills? 
GN: They don't really say. I think a lot of them are 
beginning to see what it is . See the last two years the oyster 
fishermen have been hit really hard, because they've closed so 
much of the beds because of the pollution. And they've begun to 
get serious about trying to do something about it. But you know 
what their alternative is? Dump it in the river! 
MH: The oystermen want it dumped in the river? But then the 
people downriver have the problem? 
GN: It is not uncommon I understand in times of high water 
to find the river with 1400 colonies per milliliter. And one time 
a couple years ago we had had a little party at my house. 
Everybody was getting ready to go home , and we decided to have 
some more coffee. I went in and made coffee , and, God, 
it tasted 
terrible, and I hate lousy coffee anyway, and I passed it off as 
that. 
It turned out that somewhere up river they had dumped a 
whole bunch of phenol in the river, which is an industrial 
1 
N 
Cleansing.agent,'like washing your dishes with borax, and they,
, 
said it wasn't really detrimental to your health, but my God''It 
tasted terrible and smelled-ter r ibl e . 
They've experimentally used water hyacinths to clean water, 
and they'll actually do it. They did in Orlando, they're doing it 
in San Diego, so, 
in a way, you don't want to clear all the 
hyacinths out of the water, because they will clean the water 
out. And I've suggested th- - . - ht to go to Jefferson Parish 
and ask them not to spra , Millido 
Canal -- let it fill with 
lilies, because they will clean that sewer water. 
(strange that a plant killed by the excrement of almost 
microscopic bugs will purge water of human sewerage) 
I'm not sure the average person realizes how bad the quality 
of water is. 
I think they're beginning to realize it. 
MH: Is it related to the high cancer rate? 
GN: I don't think there's any question about it. They say 
the river water is the source of the drinking water for most of 
the communities. 
In fact one of the reports said that the way New 
Orleans used to purify their water was producing more carcinogens 
or pathogens in the water than if they were to leave it alone. 
It 
was the way they purified. The process wasn't healthy. 
See now, the idea is that if we put a water control device 
in the end of this canal, and maintain a minimum water level, 
then all of these things would not leak water. We'd be able to 
hold water in the marsh longer. Then when this water goes down, 
affected by tide and whatever we wouldn't see this rapid drop in 
water. 
(story about a ten foot alligator he saw out here when he 
was out last year) 
Now, see this little device here? That's where one of the 
trappers has put a control device in to hold water in the marshes 
along the trapline. Right here, see those boards? 
MH: Like a little dam 
GN: When he comes out and traps he'll be able to hold water 
in there and the nutria'll stay in there -- that's his trapping 
trainasse. 
MH: So some people use water and some use fire to regulate 
the marsh 
GN: What you do is you hold the water in the little 
trainasse and then you burn everything around it so the 
animals'll stay around the edge of the trainasse, but I'm sure a 
lot of em think they're enriching the marsh by doing that. That's' 
not uncommon. That's all through the country a lot of people burn 
every year. But I think most people will agree every year is not 
a good idea.

ON: He thinks he was picked up by a flying saucer once 
MH: So this trapper lives in Crown Point and the other one 
lives in Tarpaper 
ON: Now the one that lives in Tarpaper traps way up in the 
upper end. 
MH: What kind of boats do they use? 
ON: They'll being a boat like this out, and then they'll use 
they'll either walk their trapline or they'll do a pirogue 
MH: How many traps are they likely to have in a line, and 
what are their sets like? 
ON: They'll set it along the edge of the water -- either 
attached to one of the wax myrtles or they'll drive a pole and 
they set em -- like where I showed you where the nutrias come in 
and out? That's where they'll set em. 
MH: Do they use a circular set? 
ON: Most of em will set along the edge of your trenage ( sp?)
• 
as you go -- 150 traps is not uncommon 
(ON points out a red - shouldered hawk -- MH sees a 
kingfisher) 
(wind gets bad here) 
MS: Is this where you had your fences up? 
ON: Yeah that's where my fence is 
MS: Another experiment 
ON: Hey, watch out, that's science at work! ( sees a great 
blue heron) See the post way out in the lake? I had a fence, a 
snow fence, we tried to break the inertia of the waves to keep 
this from erroding away. Didn't work. See, 
look at this here. 
What happened is, 
it tore pieces of the outer marsh and brought 
em in and laid em in here -- and you got a little island --
MS: That's'a fairly narrow strip isn't it? 
ON: It's now less than twenty feet -- when I came he re it 
was forty,. Plus marsh on the other side -- it really at e it up 
this is LL and Leland ( sp?) We've not purchased it yet 
TT: What's the impact? 
y" 
here ON: Well if it brea ks through then it's gonna start 
MS: And the corps probably won't dredge this 
TT: And it is gonna break through 
GN: Oh yeah, no question about it, 
it's all the way through 
now -- see how high it is? It took that piece of marsh and tore 
it up and then laid it on a line like this -- it's almost two 
feet higher -- it's kinda neat 
MS: We could sell you a piece of this, cheap! 
ON: I got pictures during this, we came out after the 
hurricane, we almost made it across the top of that in this boat 
-- These are Chine se Ta ll ow trees, which is an exotic. If w 
followed our real true cause we would attempt to get rid of em, 
cause it's an exotic, however it's the only thing holdin these 
levees together --
MH: Is that why it was put there? 
ON: No they grew there because when they drug this out, the 
little high elevations, we got a community there 
MH: Who planted them there? 
ON: Nobody, they're a natural plant -- the seed 
distribution. You can tell your new levees from the older ones, 
the older ones have wax myrtle, oak, maples and things like that 
and tallow trees are on almost all of the new ones 
MH: Do tallow trees have a waxy substance on them 
GN: It's just an imported landscape tree that's just 
adaptable, extremely adaptable -- I assume they're from Southeast 
Asia -- we'll go see if we can find those duckhunters and talk to 
ern up there 
I took a picture of it, one of the markers, 
it says 49 on 
it -- if you go out in the lake there's a channel, near a marsh 
with a great big sign -- one of ern is back there, 
it's as big as 
the front of this boat --
TT: You think a storm brought it in? 
ON: I'm sure it did! ( laughing) I thought it was kinda 
funny! 
(joking and laughing about Tom Tankersly's hat) 
GN: The duckhunters are back at their boat --
MH: What is that? 
ON: A little pond where the birds are 
*H: Are the ponds natural? ; 
ON: Yeah -- you can't see it, 
but there's one of our transit 
lines -- you can see'one of the white poles right there -- This 
is one of the oil wells -- see the tree line ahead of us, that's 
the pipeline where we just were -- these are the guys that were 
hunting in that series of ponds 
(more laughing over Tankersly's stocking hat -- it's down 
over his face and his glasses are on the outside)

Tom's {a 
killer -- he has a kil ler card -- he may not look like it, 
but h 
is. 
I want to show you something -- you see that big piece of 
material right there? You know where that came from? The edge o 
the lake 
TT: You're kidding! 
ON: that's what got torn up by the hurricane 
big pieces 
of marsh like that -- it got transported all the way down here 
MS: Is that a locust? 
ON: Yeah 
MH: What's that? 
ON: That's a tallow tree! A popcorn tree -- it looks like 
popcorn, doesn't it? 
MS: We're not goin around checkin these guys far 
ON: I would if y' a ll weren't with me 
ON: Lambert and I were out here, and Burahas ( SP?) I came 
out on Sunday with them -- we came up here and we found a pirogue 
sitting here -- so we checked out here and we carne back and it 
was gone, and we hadn't seen anybody. So I said, okay, Pull over 
here and let me off, and I went trudgin out to find him, and 
about time I got halfway up here he came out and started paddling 
away, so we carne up to him, he had a 12-guage -- one of those old 
Ted Williams 12-guage -- which was a fine gun when they first 
made it -- no trigger guard! Can you imagine hunting with a gun 
with no trigger guard? -- He had a plug in it, cause we checked 
it. 
I said, don't you think you ought to get a trigger guard for 
that? He said, " I tried, but I can't find the part for it." I 
said, " You oughta get somebody to make you one -- you're gonna 
shoot yourself!" 
MS: As long as you're within the rules, anyone can come out 
here and hunt, right? 
ON: Absolutely. This is a perfectly legal place to hunt _ 
i 
it used to say it was prohibited in National Historical Parks and 
National Park s -- bu t we changed 36 CFR M
 to accomodate -- 
MS: Why aren't there -- there just aren't enough ducks? 
ON: Lousy habitat for ducks -- there's nothin for ern to eat, 
plus the water level goes up and down so much they won't stay out 
there in those ponds -- those ponds are the fishing hole -- but 
we gotta get the water back up again -- next time it gets up 
we're gonna come fly fish those ponds 
MH: Flyfishing? 
ON: Oh yeah, I love to flyfish 
MH: What would they get? 
ON: Bass, perch, croppie, sunfish, -- One
-,of the best 
ces 
to croppie fi s h is r ig ht there in that dry hole -- I sat 
talked here and
to a guy -- lamt spring, they were sittin there catchin ern 
as fast as 
(a plane flies by, 
w ith pontoons on it, for landing on 
water -- discussion about that) 
ON: Alright, we're going for the lake -- we're going to see 
Grande Chenier Cochille -- Now this is another dry hole that they 
went out and dug, and it's broken through -- I'll show you a 
typical example of what this looks like now 
MH: What's that lake on the other side? .. 
GNz That's Lake Salvador -- now see these big chunks, 
they're all back in here too 
MHz That was Hurricane Juan that did that? 
ON: ( nods) ( stops the boat) Now this was at least a hundred 
yards to the
-Yake, two years ago -- see how it ripped it up and 
threw it back up here on top of what was here? 
(nutria are around) 
MH: Do the hurricanes kill the nutria? 
ON: A lot of em drown, but see, here they could get in to 
the higher ridges -- see how it just picked all this up and 
brought it back in here and laid it on top of it? See that sign? 
Two years ago when Tommy and I put out the trenches that sign was 
up on the shore. 
It ripped it, man. This'll , grow up again, but 
it's very vulnerable now, because there's actually a little, 
if 
you want to call it a trenasse all the way through there now -- a 
couple good -- January or February I think this'll actually be 
gone -- when those winter fronts come through, we get a 
tremendous northwest wind -- that's when it really tears it up. 
-- Last year it wasn't all that bad, we only had a couple 
Gain for the lake! ( starts boat again) 
Rambo gloves. 
This was a cemetery -- they dug right through the middle of 
it. 
The local people that live down here, 
it was their cemetery 
MH: Were they upset? 
ON: Yeah, but the oil companies don't care, they did it 
anyway• They just dug it up and threw it out 
MH: Could they have done that if it was an Indian cemetery? 
ON: No, 
but back then they could, because there were very 
few restrictions back then -- in the 50s, early 60s --
Evidently the local people that lived'here were very upset 
about it, 
but it didn't do ern any good 
MS: If you own an Indian mound on your property you can tear 
it up, can't you? 
MH: Developers are supposed to report any finds --
TT: If I buy some land, I can do anything I want with it 
but if I get an FHA loan there may be restrictions 
(indiscernible discussion) 
(Fish are jumping all over Lake Salvador) 
ON: Could be mullet, could be bass, could be trout 
MS: Isn't this part of an old mound? 
ON: Yes it is -- now you see that tree over there 
when I 
carne here that tree was on the shore 
MS: When George came here, the Indians were still hunting 
shells 
ON: That's right, that's true, I forgot! 
TT: Man, 
if I were anywhere else in this country, 
I'd say 
it's gonna snow 
MS: They got snow in Shreveport last Friday 
(etc) 
MS: But here, when the clouds come in it warms up, and when 
the clouds go away it cools off -- you can't get snow 
ON: This was an Indian midden -- a lotta pieces of pottery 
along the shoreline. 
MHz Who lives there? 
GN: Those were camps -- hunting camps 
the one with. the

green front I think is occupied now 
(we land) This is Grand Chenier Cochille 
MS: Can a chenier be any size? 
ON: and any make-up

GN: That was developed before 
until the big bridge was put in in 
on the west of it 
MH: Who used it then? 
GN: Just a few people over here that hunted and fished and 
lived right along the river -- probably nobody came down here 
much at all -- I'm sure there was as much trapping and fishing 
going on over here as there was down in there but the oil boom, 
see, hit over here

when they did all the exploration

Barataria -- but it's just kind of a mix of people 
TT: It's more of a region 
MS: Yeah -- there's no ethnic group there 
TT: They are a grouping of people -- that don't fit 
i 
necessarily in any one other category -- massive cross-
culturalization 
MHz So they don't have like local festivals? 
TT: Yeah, they have the pirogue race, they have some 
festivals, Lafitte has a festival every year, 
but it's not billed 
as a " Baratarian" fest -- it's billed as a- banana festival -
MS: Kind of like the Bridge City Gumbo festival 
TT: Like the orange festival for Plaquernines Parish -- most 
of the groups have one fest each year, 
like an Italian fest, a 
German fest, a Greek fest, and that type of thing --
MH; In Plaquernines do the Yugoslavians have a festival or is 
it the Orange festival? 
TT: Yeah, it's not a Yugoslavian festival 
MHz So you have a lot of regional resource festivals? 
TT: Yeah, 
like Irvan Perez went over to the Orange Festival 
he was an exhibiter in the Orange Festival, his duck decoys --
MS: Irvan Perez goes to every festival there is, doesn't he? 
MHz Well, are there musicians among the Baratarians? 
MS: No 
TT: There's probably some country musicians and some rock 
'n' 
rolls -- but there's not a distinctive mug-i6 style -- if 
there's anything there might be a real diluted
,Cajun style in 
there somewhere 
MHz Any boatbuilders? 
MS: Oh yeah 
TT: Yeah, you're gonna find boatbuilders there and 
MS: One of the best, 
in fact, 
is over there 
TT: You're gonna find your subsistence- type crafts and 
skills -- your netmakers, your boatbuilders, cooks, quilters, 
probably same basket makers 
MS: Even some trenasse makers

MH: Storytellers? 
TT: Probably some storytellers in there somewhere, Frank -
Aret ( sp?) 
He's not the type of storyteller you're-• talking about 
but he's a good storyteller 
MH: I'm talking about good talkers with stories about 
nutrias, alligators, making a living 
MS R TT: That's Danny 
MH: Is he from Barataria? 
MS: Yeah, he grew up there -- he traps in there 
TT: Danny's probably an epitome of a Baratarian, wouldn't 
you think? 
MS: Oh yes -- Danny's a perfect Baratarian 
MH: You've got the capacity to develop a vernacular 
interpretive program there 
TT: Supposedly a lot of these Baratarians themselves are 
actually descendants of Lafitte's band of Baratarians, too. 
MH: Do they accept that? 
MS: Oh, God, yes 
TT: I would say they're real proud of that -- that's as good 
as saying you're a relative to Edwards or Huey G. 
Long 
MS: That puts you right up into the social class -- Lafitte 
is a very well respected man down here 
TT: He played a social game with his piracy that made him 
acceptable, which parallels politics in Louisiana •( 
MH: In the ethnic vs. the regional approach you could have 
sorne people left out --
TT: When you've got thirty of them you're gonna cut people 
off, and when someone takes a serious look at reports that have 
been done they're gonna see where the focus has been -- but I 
think that's a potential goal maybe of Jim's -- to say, well take 
for example the Yugoslays -- this is one that nobody else has set 
on so we're not just going with traditional groups -- Next year, 
might be the year of the Asian -- let's go for the Asian 
communities, because that could be a real good political hot 
spot, go for them -- because they're big numbers here -- they're 
startin to make an impact on tradition in Louisiana -- they're 
rnakin an impact on the fishing industry and the oyster industry 
-- their lifestyle is unique -- their communal lifestyle is very 
much like the old lifestyle you hear about from all the other 
ethnic groups but no longer exist in those ethnic groups, so 
they're the new pioneers and they're the ones that probably have 
th strongest traditions at this point, so I can see how they're a-
real viable group at this point because they're real new, but 
MH: And the Filipinos from way back 
MS: We've taken care of them, they're already covered -- the 
problem with something like the Filipinos is there aren't enough 
Filipinos any more tb really consider them a viable group --
their history was neat, but they're not a -- it's hard to carry 
them forward as a subculture, 
if you will, today, and say, " Let's 
go find the Filipinos -- what few are here are all over the 
place." 
TT: Jamaicans, you know there's a bundle of Jamaicans around 
here, but how are you going to find them in this day and age? 
MS: We've talked about trying to prioritize which out of 
these thirty groups we could identify as being influential .,--
I 
a 
-which six or eight groups were the most influential? That are 
still around, like the Caj u ns -- or the Jews, they were 
important and there are still Jews in Louisiana, but does the 
Park Service need to open a Jewish Cultural Center in Louisiana? 
them TT: No, W6 don't need to get into it to that degree with 
MS: The Greeks have their own festival -- and their own big 
church 
TT: On the other hand, I can see -- you know this little 
Italian museum down there -- I've read about it four times, and 
I've seen a couple of news things about it, 
and it actually looks 
like a very noble attempt -- but it looks like one of those 
things that could use some assistance from us 
MS: We've got to go over there one day  
TT: We could have a cooperative agreement to help them with 
exhibitry or whatever

TEXT: 
MS: The Pinelands was more like Barataria 
MH: The whole problem there was to talk about how their 
policies of land management could address traditional culture 
right now, partly by becoming more aware of how traditional 
culture intersects with natural resources -- the canoe carnivals, 
christmas bird counts, deer hunting, all strata of society -
it's more a humanistic view of a place than an effort to 
determine what came from Italy 
TT: When I read about the Pinelands study the first thing 
that carne to my mind was Barataria 
MS: Yeah 
MH: An exhibit that treats the trapper's eye- view of 
Barataria would be interesting, especially with all the 
linguistic differences 
TT: Well, so far it's been somewhat limited -- how many of 
those exciting things would be applicable to Yugoslays? 
MH: Probably a lot of them 
(description of Camden project) 
TT: ( re: the problem of finding too much significance) When 
you isolate you tend to magnify, and if you were to sit down and 
say Louisiana and you were to hit on the instaht hot spots they'd 
have to be jazz, creole and cajun cooking, and cajun, and the 
fishing, the shrimp 
that's it! But we got quilting, we got 
basket makers, and they show up at every festival, and you can't 
find your trap makers any more, your netters, and you know that 
anybody that is capable of repairing a net should have the 
ability to make a net -- now technology has it now that they 
don't have to make the nets because it's cheaper timewise to go 
out and buy ern -- it still doesn't mean that they're not 
qualified as netmakers 
I've sat out there with shrimpers, when 
they get out there an hour and a half before sundown, to claim 
their spot and they spend that hour and a half re-workin the'_ 
I 
netting, and I think, well, 
if he had to he could start from 
beginning to end -- and I know he could -- but they don't stick 
out at you, and they are significant -- Old Herman's got more 
value than being Antonio's husband, because, Herman Gonzales --
I'm trying to 
o fin_d__oyA_t how to use_Her_aian, 
if nothing else, just 
to get Herman to build a pirogue in a day, cause I'll tell you, 
that boat he built me , he bu ilt in e ig ht hours, and I think 
that's pretty damn impressive -- he's usin a friggin skill saw 
and marine plywood, but dammit ( tongue in cheek) that's not an 
art -- that's a folk art -- that's
-the real McCoy -- its not a 
wooden, full cypress boat -- that, 
in some ways, 
is perpetuating 
an old art, but is not necessarily folklife, because it's not 
current --
MH: (like polyester quilts and cork decoys) 
TT: That's the current folk style -- I think it's of value 
to have your cypress one sittin over in the corner, but I can't 
see employin a guy to build a boat for eight days just for the 
sake of havin a boat built for eight days, when conceivably, we 
could put a boat on exhibit and have Herman build a boat in a 
day, and have it a one day exhibit. A beat is a boat if it 
floats. 
MS: But then people would be upset -- they would say " That's 
not traditional." 
What is this guy screwing everything up, makin 
a boat in eight hours -- I thought it was supposed to take 18 
weeks -- where's the personal touch? Where's the craftsmanship? 
You obviously don't have any! Right? 
TT: But I think that's part of our objective -- folklife 
doesn't just mean old tradition -- it means present tradition, 
and it's traditional for a guy to go out and crank out a plywood 
pirogue 
MS: Danny makes em out of fiberglass in a mold! 
TT: I think it would be good to have a fiberglasser out 
there -- bring in a mold and have im fiberglass -- but I don't 
know if fiberglass is too dangerous -- I've talked to people who 
say they'll never make but four or five fiberglass boats 
Does a universal acceptance of country/western to the Isleno 
community mean that country/western isn't significant? Because 
it's not in origin -- they perform it. 
MH: They perform it in Ireland too, 
in every bar, moreso 
than traditional Irish music 
MS: And everybody down here talks about the only reason they. 
want to keep traditions at all is because they're afraid of 
losing em -- Mark ( Savoy) and everyone -- it's all " We want our 
children to
-- learn the old ways." 
In many ways, kids don't have to 
learn French -- they would certainly survive in this country 
without learning a word of French --
Cause you already see clashes around here where the kids 
don' •t want to -- it's like Mark and his music -- the kids that 
learn to play the accordian want to adapt it -- they don't want 
to necessarily play it the sPmA way he does -- they want to learn 
it from him, 
but they don't want to play the same music 
TT:,One thing I was surprised at, 
in Ray ( Brassieur), when I 
was up at the National Folklife Festival, part of the festival, 
one ofthe performing groups were some breakdancers from 
Philadelphia -- Ray made a negative comment about that -- he said 
something to the effect that " this isn't folkli 
j 
furiklife. " 
And that struck me as strange, beta 
was a really viable program
