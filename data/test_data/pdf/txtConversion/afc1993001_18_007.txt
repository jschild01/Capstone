Introduction
  
This essay contains a historical evaluation of Polish curriculum
 
materials done as a part of a project concerned with contemporary ethnic
 
education in the United States and organized by the American Folklife

Center at the Library of Congress./Polish textbooks  published between 1
867
 
and 1981 in Warsaw, Vienna, Toronto, LOndon, Chicago, Niles, Ill., Scranton,
 
Pa. are analyzed as a source of social history in the United States.
 
Additional sources such as secondary histories of Polish and Polish American
 
education as well as Jubilee books issued at important anniversaries have
 
been consulted and analyzed as support data. American readers and primers
 
have been studied and analyzed as sources for historical investigation
 
(
i.e., Elson:196l,
  Guardians of Tradition), but the story is incomplete
 
without the complementary "ethnic" saga: we find out not only about the
 
concerns, values, and customs of these immigrants, but also how these
 
values were being changed and adopted, how Americans were perceived by
 
these outsiders. Moreover, one finds out how the ethnic group, an empha-
tically America- phenomenon, was being created against this strong immigrant
 
or "foreign" background.
 
This essay traces the format and changing content of the Polish
 
textbooks used in Polish schools in the United States which both reflected
 
and affected the development of Polish American ethnicity.
 
Though there were groups of Polish immigrants and settlers coming
 
to America earlier, the mass of Polish immigration entered the United States
 
in the second half of the nineteenth century with the largest influx between
 
the 1890s and the 1910s. Schools were opened by Polish parishes starting with
 
Hauser-2
 
in 1870s and entrusted to teaching orders, especially that of the Felician
 
Sisters. Priests and the order of Resurrectionists were also very important
 
in the developing of the Polish parochial school system which by the 1930s had
 
some 500 schools in the United States.
 
Poland had no independent status in the nineteenth century as a
 
result of the partitions of its territory between Russia, Prussia and Austria
 
in late eighteenth century--a historical fact which the Polish society never
 
accepted and against which it repeatedly rose in arms. Especially difficult
 
and stubborn, if less glamorous than the tradition of armed uprisings, was
 
the
 
the insistence, all though the period of/partitions, on the defense of the
 
Polish language against the attempts of all the partitioning powers to elimi-
nate its use from the public arena. The stories of school strikes and of mani-
festations by students who insisted on using their native language can be
 
found in the textbooks used in the United States (
often in the series of
 
textbooks published in London). In America, the defense of the Polish language
 
was also the proclaimed aim of Polish education--but the defense was fought
 
in a much more difficult situation, and on the whole it was much less successful.
 
In this essay we first discuss the textbooks that were brought over
 
from Poland in the nineteenth century from the southern part of partitioned
 
Poland called Galicia. Published in Vienna under the imperial eye these books
 
represented much Austrian and no Polish nationalism. They were ill fitted for
 
the use of patriotically oriented children in Poland, much less those in the U
.S.
 
Very soon, therefore, new Polish American textbooks were produced in Chicago
 
--the first in the 1870s and published in two independent, secular publishing
 
houses. These textbooks probably contained too little religious emphasis
 
for parochial school use. In the 1920s and 1930s two popular, Roman Catholic
 
Polish series of books were produced by the Felician Order in the printery of
 
St. Hedwig in Niles, Ill. Before discussion the Felician textbooks, I include
 
an analysis of a jubilee book published to commemorate 25th anniversary of
 
priesthood of Father Strzelecki, a pastor of the St. Stanislaus parish in New
 
Hauser-3
 
York, N
.Y. Published in 1916, it includes interesting material on the parish
 
school that the priest organized and run. It is my contention that studying
 
A
 
ethnic textbooks must be complemented by analysis of such celebratory literature
 
to dicover the resèin d
'etre and the program of ethnic schools, as well as
 
for finding out what textbooks actually were used.
 
Following the World War in 1918, the Polish American community entered
 
the period of its greater consolidation as an American ethnic group rather than
 
as a Polish group living in the United States. This period was marked by a proli-
feration of literature, both religious and secular, Roman Catholic and schisma-
tic, as the group was consolidating not as a monolithic whole but by and around
 
the internal tensions and conflicts that it underwent. Besides the very prolific
 
Felician Sisters, I managed to find examples of much more modest educational
 
efforts on the part of the schismatic Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC).
 
This schism occured and developed in Scranton, Pa. Though the scope and influence
 
of the PNCC schools and educational efforts cannot be compared in magnitude with
 
the prevailing importance of the traditional Roman Catholic parochial school
 
among Poles in America, nevertheless, the content analysis of the few textbooks
 
published under the auspicies of the PNCC adds an important dimension to the
 
overall efforts of Poles in America, and it elucidates certain aspects of the
 
social background and social concerns that were at the root of the schism.
 
After World War II, a new wave of Polish immigrants entered America,
 
immigrants who were in many respect incompatible with the '
old' Polish
 
American immigration. After World War II, the parochial schools begun to
 
loose interest in teaching Polish both because they had not enough staff
 
who knew standard Polish and because of the pressures from the American
 
Catholic hierarchy to mainstream the ethnic parishes and schools. In this
 
situation the new immigrants resorted to open supplementary schools in which
 
they themselves served as teachers. This phenomenon happened in many countries
 
of the Polish diaspora after the Polish state came under the Soviet influence.
 
The new immigrants often considered themselves "politi ca lV in opposition
 
Hauser-4
 
to the earlier "economic" i
nmligration. A Polish langua
 
was shifted from the parochial schools to the supplemen
 
of the Saturday schools. In the New York area the precedence of Saturday
 
supplementary education had been already established as a result of desire
 
on the part of the Polish intelligentsia to break the church monopoly on
 
Polish education in the U]lted States. In Chicago the network of the Saturday
 
schools was created anew.
 
New textbooks were needed for a drastica l
ly altered program of the
 
Saturday schools, and they were compiled and published in the major centers
 
of Polish settlement i
.e. in London, England and Chicago, Ill. The last part
 
of this essay analyzes the textbooks currently used in the Saturday supplemen-
tary Polish language schools in America.
 
The First Schools and the Galician Textbooks 
Though there were earlier groups of Polish emigres who settled
 
in America in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth
 
centuries,  the majority of Polish Americans entered the United
 
States after the second part of the nineteenth century.
 These
 
later immigrants were mostly of peasant origin.
 The first school
 
for the immigrants was opened in 1867 in a small Polish settlement
 
in Texas named Panna Maria  (Our Lady)  near Galveston.
 This was a
 
one room school as were the other schools slowly opening in the
 
centers of Polish immigration.
 Twenty years later,  in 1887,  there
 
were fifty such schools in America.
 Still it was only during the
 
following decade that the majority of Polish immigrants entered the
 
United States  (from 1890 to 1914 between two and three million
 
Poles were registered as immigrants at United States entry ports 1 ).
 
Before starting to discuss the bulk of Polish immigration and the
 
growth of Polish schools that coincided with the decision of the
 
American Catholic episcopate to invest in Catholic education,  let
 
us look at what was taught to Polish children in Panna Maria,  Texas
 
and in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
 
Miaso  (
1972)  and others have ascertained that the early Polish
 
schools in the United States that used textbooks used books pub-
lished in Galicia.
 Galicia was the only part of partitioned Poland
 
that, due to the policy of "cultural autonomy" was able to maintain
 
elementary as well as secondary and higher education in the Polish
 
language.

item)  collection of Polish language primers and readers published
 
in Vienna for official use in Galician public and private Polish
 
language schools.
 They all bear the imprint of official publi
 
tion and approval  for use in schools under the imperial Austri
 
power and were published between 1867 and 1870.
 
Just like the early American primers and general readers that
 
were often imported from England,  these i
nidcentury textbooks
 
offered a compilation of general knowledge,  put an emphasis on dis-
cipline,  and were not intended to stir intellectual curiousity in
 
any way.
 Formally they recognized the ethnic and religious dis-
tinctions acknowledged by the Austrian government as important:
 
there were separate readers for town, village, Catholic and Luth-
eran schools.
 They all offered basically the same instruction.
 In
 
terms of political affiliation they all stressed loyality to the
 
government.

and politics is sketchy and is mixed with fables,  puzzles, and
 
legends.
 
These books were only useful if the students'  parents were
 
planning to return to Galicia.
 Such a pattern of return did become
 
1
 
L

common among the immigrants, but it did 1establish itself until much
 
later  (
see Hauser 1981).
 Moreover, the first immigrants, who were
 
most likely the users of these books, usually came not from Galicia
 
but from Prussian and Russian Poland.
 Even if they planned to
 
return,  these books presented no relevant knowledge for them.
 
Besides being irrelevant to the experience of Poles in America,
 
these first books were insulting to the nationalistic spirit of the
 
Polish immigrants to the United States.
 
The First Polish American Textbooks 
There are twelve primers and low-grade readers within the
 
Library of Congress collection.
 They were published by two Polish
 
American secular publishers, Wiadyslaw Dyniewicz and Jan Smuiski,
 
between 1876 and 1916 in Chicago.
 On the whole,  the first readers
 
resemble the Austrian textbooks in form and content, with the
 
dramatic omission of the Austrian imperial propaganda.
 They were
 
prepared for the Polish parish schools in the United States and
 
Polish Catholicism is emphatically stressed in them as an integral
 
part of the Polish national identity.

and a general reader,  published in 1884  (Przyjaciel Dzieci) 
as well as two subsequent primers, published in 18
_ and 18
 ,
 all
 
represent a minimal departure from the Galician model of a text-
book.
 Galician textbooks had no illustrations, were in small print
 
and were relatively thick.
 They were intended for use in more than
 
one grade.
 The oldest  (
1870)  primer had only one picture, a draw-
ing of Christ on the Cross.
 The 1884 reader was intended to be
 
used in four grades and it stressed discipline and obedience to
 
authority.
 It offered little more than exemplary stories and
 
fables.
 The Friend of the Children, published in 1884 was also to
 
be used by four different grades.
 The first part aims to teach the
 
children how to read and the first sentences they were to read were
 
"God rules,"  "Concord builds,"  "Discord ruins." The rest of the
 
book includes readings of simple poems and short excerpts from
 
literature as well as stories about different nations  (Arabs and
 
Jews,  for
xample).
 Finally there were readings pertaining to the
 
history of Poland, Christianity,  the Crusades, geographic
 
discoveries,  the use of minerals and the invention of the tele-
phone.
 On the very last pages appear a compilation on the human
 
body with a short and simple description of all bodily
 
functions... .except for the reproductive.
 
According to contemporary sources,  children learned little in
 
these schools besides some poems,  some facts from Polish history
 
and from biographies of major Polish historical figures.
 The
 
method of teaching was mnemonic, and children learned how to write
 
by copying letters from the blackboard.
 These methods, however,
 
did not vary drastically from the instruction offered in American
 
-

 Hauser
 
public schools at this time  (Miaso 125).
 
Early school readers that combine fables,  tales,  history,  puz-
zles,  and religion,  as well as some literature and,  most of all,
 
moral  instruction are known to historians of education as "s(-
 ,
-
collections." There were used in the United States in Englis
 
language schools at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of
 
the nineteenth centuries  (Carpenter 1963).
 Both Austrian and early
 
Polish American readers seem to be on a slightly higher level, how-
ever,  than the simple textbook of the "school collection" type.
 
Both Austrian and Polish American readers,  like the Przyjaciel
  
Dzieci seem to have been modeled on a different genre of school
 
textbook, one that offers a compilation of divergent material but
 
includes more serious information.
 Der Kinderfreunde, a German
 
reader published in 1776 and written by Von Rauchen, was extremely
 
popular in Germany among both Catholics and Protestants.
 It served
 
as a model reader for many generations of English and American edu-
cators.
 
It is possible that Dyniewicz's Przyjaciel Dzieci had excerpts
 
that were translated from later verions of Der Kinderfreunde.
 
Though Przyjaciel Dzieci is maintained in the spirit of moderate
 
but marked Polish patriotism,  it includes otherwise incomprehensi-
ble stories about the benevolent King Ferdinand II  (this story has
 
practically no political overtones:  it is about a good king and as
 
such could be digested by Polish patriots) .
 The task of tracing
 
the origin of the stories,  as well as a close examination of the
 
content of these books,  surpasses the scope of this essay.
 But
 
-
 6 -
 Hauser
 
that this book,  and others  like it, were closely modeled on the
 
German or English versions of The Children's Friend seems very
 
likely.
 Like most publications of this time, early Polish American
 
textbooks did not observe copy rights.
 Indeed the essential method
 
of composing a book was not merely compilation, but also outright
 
plagiarism  (
see Elson p.  10)
 
Before discussing the prevailing themes in these books,  let us
 
first look at the explicitly stated aims that these books were to
 
serve as presented in their introductory remarks and in occasional
 
self-reflecting passages from the readers on the topic of Polish
 
American schools.
 These statements are especially important for
 
the majority of present day researchers have a tendency to evaluate
 
these textbooks according to present day standards and to find
 
therefore that they oversimplify history and make embarrassing mis-
takes  (Miaso p.
 ) This line of analysis tells us little about
 
the actual period in which these books were compiled and used.
 
Only the second series of books, primers, and readers pub-
lished in 1899 carry a preface.
 The earliest books have no commen-
tary of this sort and the text usually begins with a simple prayer
 
or a song.
 The second series was published by the Smulski's Pub-
lishing Company in Chicago, while the first series was done in
 
Dyniewicz's print shop.
 The preface begins with an assertion that
 
this new series of books offers package of knowledge fully suffi-
cient for  the education of a Polish American child.
 
There were three readers in the series and,  the preface
 
assures,  together they contain so much information that ther€
 
- 7 -
Hauser
 
be no need for a fourth book.
 This suggests that the Polish Ameri-
can child was not expected  (
at least not by the publishers)  to
 
obtain education beyond the third or fourth grade level.
 The pre-
face then points out the special merits of this series:
 
The novelty of this reader lies in the fact that the
 
examples and descriptions taken from Polish history and
 
arranged as much as Possible in a chronological order,
 
are said in such a simple manner that they can be easily
 
comprehended by children.
 We do not quote any sizeable
 
excerpts taken straight from history because,  from our
 
experience as well as from the lips of our teachers ar
 
the Reverend Sisters, we know that such passages are to
 
difficult for the still mentally undeveloped children.
 
Czytanka druga dla polskich szkol w Stanach Zjednoc-
zonych, Chicago:  S
rnulski,  1899, P.  2.
 
We will return to the actual presentation of Polish history in
 
these series. But before that,  let us take a look at the school and
 
its aims as they are presented in the actual texts of the readers.
 
In one of the earlies primers  (
1889 by Smulski)  there is a
 
short excerpt about schools.
 Because it is characteristic of the
 
books in general,  i quote the entire passage:
 
Wejrzyj na nas mocny Boze
 
Niech nani laska Twa pomoze
 
Bysmy dobrze sie uczyli
 
I w nauce pilni byli
 
-

 Hauser
 
Look upon us,  mighty God
 
So Your Grace will help us
 
So that we .
study well
 
And be diligent in learning
 
I go to school gladly.  I learn diligently. When I enter
 
the school,  I politely greet the teacher. We love him.
 
The teacher also loves us;  he tells us many beautiful
 
things.
 
Before we begin our study, we say a prayer and sinc
 
During lessons I sit quietly and listen carefully.
 
the teacher calls me,  I get up and answer clearly.
 I
 
read with care and think about the readings.
 I can say
 
something about every thing that I read.
 I learn many
 
beautiful poems by heart.
 
One notices that in 1889 the standard was a male teacher.
 This was
 
at the very beginnings of the schools, when,  as many testify,  the
 
parochial schools suffered a lack of qualified teachers.
 The
 
teacher was usually either the priest or a (male)  organist.
 A
 
decade later,  as the previous quotation indicates,  the role of the
 
teacher was usually taken over by the Reverend Sisters.
 
As we see in this excerpt,  the school is closely connected to
 
and dependent upon the church organization as well as on its ideo-
logical st ucture.
 The children ask God to enlighten them and to
 
guard their study.
 Obedience and discipline are stressed before
 
the content of the instruction is mentioned.
 The content,  in turn,
 
-
 9 -
 Hauser
 
is referred to in a markedly vague manner as instruction in "beau-
tiful things." The method of teaching is mnemonic,  though under-
standing of the reading is also deemed important:
 
I write on the blackboard and on paper.
 When I write
 
with a pen,  I pay attention not to soil my notebook,  my
 
fingers and my dress with the ink.
 Sometimes I draw nice
 
pictures from the patterns in the book.
 I also learn how
 
to count.
 
When I grow up and will be smarter,  my teacher will also
 
teach me many other things.
 
After the classes we say a prayer again and sing,  thank-
ing God that he lets us learn.
 Then we quietly go home.
 
How nice it is to play after school!
 
In other schoolbooks it is clearly suggested that the reason the
 
children go to school  is the will of their parents and the will of
 
God.
 It is a "useful" way of spending time and idleness is one of
 
the cardinal vices in these texts.
 Though the children read sen-
tences in the first person singular,  it seems that no attention is
 
paid to their needs and that it merely reflects how the adults want
 
them to think.
 In contrast to the later published books,  these do
 
not even mention what the students are going to do when they c
 
up.
 In the last decades of the nineteenth century this seemed
 
to be a problem for a Polish American community.
 The significant
 
omission of any hint of social mobility seems to suggest that that
 
children were expected to follow the occupation of their parents.

 Hauser
 
Though not necessarily an avenue of social advancement,  educa-
tion was necessary to preserve the Polish identity for the second
 
generation of Polish Americans.
 In the preface to the 1907 edition
 
of Dyniewicz's primer,  the publisher appeals to the patriotic
 
spirit of the teachers:
 
Remember teachers that to you the future of our nation is
 
entrusted.
 Do help you God in this important and diffi-
cult task.
 
Elementarz Obrazkowy, Chicago:  Dyniewicz,  1907.
 
Though this appeal  is rather unusual both for the prefaces and for
 
the texts of the early readers,  Poland was ever present in them,
 
not in the form of patriotic pronouncements or programs for mili-
taristic actions,  but
 
scenes they painted.
 
textbooks  (as much as
 
simply in the language,  illustrations, and
 
One could say that these were still Polish
 
Poland,  at this time,  included foreign
 
administrations and cultural influences, as well as the fierce
 
opposition against these forces).
 We find stories about Polish
 
kings,  legendary figures, and Polish saints quite close to the way
 
these stories were preserved in folk memories.
 The early and still
 
most "foreign" text book,  Pryzyjaciel dzieci (
1884), mentions kings
 
who always appear benevolent and among them Kazimierz Wielki
 
(Casimir the Great),  a king who,  due to his gracious interest in
 
lower status people was considered the "King of the Peasants"  (p.
 
153).
 This is probably what the publishers meant when they said in
 
the 1899 preface that the stories have now been adapted to the
 
level of a child's comprehension.

Poland as a political entity is recognized as a defeated state
 
in these books.
 This is the description of Poland in the chapter
 
on geography in the Przyjaciel Dzieci: 
-  
Presently, Old Polish lands are inhabited by thirty-five
 
million people:  fifteen to seventeen million are Poles,
 
two million are Lithuanian,  over fifteen million are
 
Ukrainian and almost three million are Jews and
 
Germans .
... Abroad there are millions of Poles,  almost one
 
million in America alone.
 
The lands of "Old Poland" refer to the boarders before the parti-
tion of 1772.
 Thus,  "Old Poland" includes the whole of the Ukraine
 
-

and Lithuania,  as Polish politicians would continue to insist was
 
Poland's right.
 Though they sanctions Poland's expansionist
 
claims,  these schoolbooks in no way prepare the children to do any-
thing about Poland's future.
 It is not in their fierce patriotism
 
that books are most remarkably Polish,  it is rather in their senti-
mental,  linguistic,  and folkloristic manner.
 
The stories in these books are set in Poland.
 The illustra-
tions depict Polish villages and remind us that it was the father's
 
farm that constituted the peasant's "Fatherland" or okolica. 
These
 
early books are full of okolica. 
Besides stories about the
 
benevolence of Polish kings,  the books describe Polish painted Eas-
ter eggs.
 Illustrations of peasant homes,  such as the following,
 
appear over the word chata.
 
Similarly,  the transition from the village to the city is described
 
in the Old World a

Yet it would be wrong to give the impression that America is
 
altogether absent from these texts.
 Quite the opposite.
 They
 
were, after all,  compiled especially for use by Polish children in
 
America,  as their titles often indicate.
 But that is just it.
 
They were meant for the use of Polish children living in America,
 
not Polish American children.
 The concept of an American is absent
 
from the earliest books.
 In the geographic description of America
 
-
 13 -
 Hauser
 
in Przyjaciel dzieci it is stated that America is inhabited mostly
 
by the English,  the Irish, and the Germans--and by one million
 
Poles.
 The relationship of Poles to the United States is defined
 
in terms similar to any other nationality.
 No mention of "Ameri-
cans" is made.
 The phrase used in one of the readers amply
 
reflects and depicts this relationship: America is the land where
  
we live. 
Implied is the opposition: Poland is the land to which we
 
belong.
 
"American" heros start appearing in the readers of the second
 
series:  Jerzy Washington for example.
 In this characteristic story
 
the American theme is intrinsically intertwined with the presence
 
of Poles in this country.
 There is already a search for Polish
 
legitimation in terms of American history.
 
Jerzy Washington (note that though his first name is
 
translated, his surname does not appear in the Polish
 
version, Waszyngton)
 
Each child should know who Jerzy Washington was.
 The
 
whole world knows him as the liberator of the United
 
States.
 This country used to belong to England.
 Jerzy
 
Washington was the first who organized the nation and
 
began the war against England.
 
In this war Poles also took part: Tadeusz Kosciuszko and
 
Kazimier Pulaski.
 
Tadeusz Kosciuszko and Kazimierz Pulaski came from Poland
 
to help America in this war.  Kosciuszko went back to
 
Poland after the liberation of the United States to lead
 
-
 14 -
 Hauser
 
a war against Moscovites but he lost it.
 
Kazimierz Pulaski perished in the battle of Savannah in
 
Georgia.
 Americans cherish the memory of these two Pol-
ish heros.
 
And you,  Polish child,  should be proud of these our
 
heros.
 They are the pride of the Polish nation.
 
The idea of an international fight for freedom is presented here in
 
simplified form.
 The United States fight for freedom from England
 
is equated with the Polish struggle for national liberation against
 
the Russians  (who are referred to in the derogative Moskale, mosko-
vites).
 In the later primers--especially in the 1907 edition of
 
Dyniewicz's Elementarz, pictures of Blacks and Indians appear as
 
well as drawings of New England style, shingled houses,  schools,
 
and furniture.
 Yet the descriptions of many American holidays
 
(Thanksgiving, the Fourth of July,  etc.)  maintain the distinction
 
between us and them. 
For instance,  the following passage describes
 
how the "Americans" celebrate Thanksgiving:
 
Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is an American holiday.
 Ameri-
cans thank the Lord on this day for the many blessings
 
received.
 It is the custom on this day to eat a turkey.
 
Everybody who can, buys a turkey on this day and sits
 
around the table with his whole family.
 
Elementarz Obrazkowy, 1907. p .
 70.
 
In the illustration that accompanies this description there is a
 
family sitting around a table.
 At the head of the table are the
 
grand parents, at the opposite end a young couple. The young woman
 
-
 15 -
 Hauser
 
holds an infant.
 Three other children sit between the two couples.
 
The grandfather is carving the turkey.
 
This illustration depicts a Polish family,  it is one of those fami-
lies that can afford a turkey for their status is definitely middle
 
class. There are no boarders here,  for example, which would indi-
cate a working class household.
 The clothes that they wear also
 
indicate middle class affiliation  (the men,  for instance, wear
 
ties)
 
As for the old Polish traditions, they also find their way
 
into the textbooks.
 They are often presented as a sentimental
 
attachment to the family and, more specifically,  as an attachment
 
to the grandparents.

this 1907 primer,  indicate that the Polish community remains in the
 
liminal position of a young immigrant group:  not yet fully accept-
ing  (or accepted by)  the Americans, but already not wholly tradi-
tionally Polish either.
 
Values: The Fami1. 
The values that prevail in the traditional Polish home are
 
typical for Eastern European post-feudal societies.
 They stem from
 
a patriarchal family model and include strict social divisions
 
along class lines and respect towards authority both in terms of
 
family and of the social life outside the family.
 Religion sanc-
tions these values with supernatural authority.
 How do these
 
values appear in the early Polish American school books?  Let us
 
take a look at an arrangement of words and image on page thirty-
five of Elementarz Obrazkowy (Primer 1907):
 
-
 18 - 
Hauser
 
It might be that all  these words have in common is the peculiar
 
Polish H which is spelled,  for historic reasons, with a C,  though
 
/
 it is always pronounced simply "H." That would be true only if the
 
word "parents" Rodzice also had this consonant in it.
 It does not.
 
It seems that in the surroundings of the village huts, with words
 
that indicate basic senses, the elemental  love of a child for its
 
parents  (and for God or Country,  for instance)  forms an irresi-
stable association.
 
In the textbooks,  the concept of family underwent a predict-
able evolution.
 If one traces the definition of family from the
 
very first textbooks on,  it changes from a traditional extended
 
family to the nuclear family of industrial society.
 In 1889 the
 
First reader states:
 
Family.
 
I have a father and a mother:  these I call my parents.
 
Parents provide me with food and care to furnish all my
 
needs.
 My parents love me and I love them too and I do
 
what they tell me to do.
 
Children ought to be obedient to their parents.
 Diso-
bedient children never achieve anything.
 My parents
 
have, beside me,  other children: they are my brothers an,
 
sisters.
 I love my brothers and sisters.
 Siblings ought
 
to love each other and should not quarrel.
 
We also have people who serve us and do the housework: we
 
call them servants  (or farm hands:  in Polish czeladz). 
Servants ou'ght to be loyal, diligent, obedient, and mod-
-
 19 -
 Hauser
 
est.
 They receive bread in return and attainments from
 
the master.
 The master  (
chlebodawca: literally,  bread-
giver)  ought to be polite towards his servants and ought
 
to reward them regularly.
 
First Reader 1889,  p.  46.
 
No doubt this moralistic excerpt had been copied from some old
 
world Polish textbook,  since it describes a country squire's fam-
ily.
 Polish American children would not be able to relate this
 
model of a
 
master and
 
of the men
 
family to
 
his wife)
 
who owned
 
their experience.
 The Polish panstwo (
the
 
were as distant from them as were family lives
 
the factories where their parents,  and often
 
the children themselves, worked.
 I have not encountered in this or
 
any other series of Polish American textbooks any description of a
 
family with boarders.
 Yet this was the reality of every day life
 
for the great majority of Polish American children at this time.
 
Having a boarder  (or being one)  obviously never constituted an
 
ideal pattern for family behavior in this community.
 
In subsequent excerpts on family the paragraph on servants
 
disappears and the emphasis on the proper behavior towards your
 
relatives shifts to the necessity of exercising family solidarity.
 
The Third reader in the same series begins:
 
Father, mother,  and we children together constitute a
 
family.
 Other relatives, grandpa, grandma, uncles and
 
aunts also belong to the family.
 In decent and exemplary
 
families, all  love each other and respect each other.
 If
 
happiness comes to one, the whole family rejoices.
 If
 
-
 20 -
 Hauser
 
one is overwhelmed with grief,  everyone mourns.
 
Third Reader 1889.
 In Polish families,  as in many
 
other immigrant families,  the children, even when they
 
became adults,  as long as they lived with their parents
 
would turn all their earnings into the family pool.
 This
 
is the economic reality underpinning the sentiments
 
expressed above.
 One should bear in mind that the family
 
described in the 1889 text was still a family of recent
 
immigrants, which indicates that the economic bases of
 
familial solidarity were deeply ingrained in the Polish
 
tradition.
 
What is the basis of familial  love?
 When you look closely at
 
the pronouncements about the mutual obligations of family members
 
it appears that there were more than purely sentimental reasons icr
 
the imperative to love.
 In fact,  love itself is described in quit
 
economic terms.
 Children,  for instance, are said to owe parents
 
gratitude:
 
Parents have many troubles over bringing up their chil-
dren:  they feed them, cloth them,  and when one gets sick,
 
they bring over a doctor and buy the
 
medicine...Especially small children cause their parents
 
many troubles.
 
The love that parents give to their children and the love that
 
children owe their parents combine. economic obligation with reli-
gious sanction:
 
-
 21 -
 Hauser
 
When I was bigger, my parents took me to the church and
 
sent me to school.
 Even now they remember and care for
 
me so that I don't want for anything.
 What haven't they
 
done to make me a wise, hard-working,  and honest person?
 
They have done all these things because such is God's
 
will and out of great love for me.  I will never be a
1
 
.
to repay all those things that they have done
 
doing for me.
 So at least I want to be gratef'
 
to love my parents with all my strength and pray for them
 
each day of my life.
 When they grow old, when their
 
strength will desert them,  They will have my help and my
 
consolation.
 I remember the Fourth Commandment:  Revere
 
your father and your mother so that you live long.
 
In the last sentence,  the Fourth Commandment is amended to include
 
destiny's reward for fulfilling your obligations towards your
 
parents.
 These obligations include taking care of them when they
 
grow old.
 
The family is the basic social unit, and it is presented as
 
such in these textbooks.
 They are looked at as miserable creatures
 
with a tragic lot:  oftentimes it is suggested that,  in fact, they
 
would be better off dead.
 
Orphans and widows have special significance as a theme for
 
they provide an embodiment of poverty and misfortune, yet are
 
nobody's fault.
 There is no place-in which these textbooks address
 
problems of social injustice.  There is no concept of social injus-
tice in these textbooks, poverty and misfortune are due to blind

Hauser
 
accident or bad luck.
 God's will  is not to be questioned.
 
Instead,  orphans go to heaven where they are reunited with their
 
parents and thus achieve happiness.
 
Not only are the social structure of industrial society and
 
the inequalities between people not elaborated on,  the whole theme
 
of modern industrial work is not mentioned either.
 The next series
 
of books,  all published in Chicago, breaks this silence.

The Manitoba Readers 
These two readers,  entirely in Polish excpt for the front
 
page and published in Chicago in 1916, constituted a puzzle
 
that was not easy to solve. The front pafe reads:
 
The Manitoba Readers (Polish)
 
Approved by the Advisory Board for th e use  in th e 
Public School of Manitoba
 
The Polish Research Institute in Canada has published a monograph
 
entitled The Poles of Manitoba written by Wiktor Turek, and it
 
is this book that explained the puzzle why were Polish language
 
in 1916
 
texts adopted/as part of a Canadian public school curriculum? -
-
We learn from this book that the predominantly agrarian Polish
 
immigrants to the Canadian province of Manitoba, who had no mer'
 
than two Polish schools in the district, were,  at one point,
 
courted by the French Candian clergy to support a bill estàbiishir.
 
bi-lingual education in Manitoba's public schools. The author
 
points out that the farmers who came from Poland had little mo-
tivation to send their children to any school at that time,  since
 
the children were needed in the farms. The immigrants had no cash
 
to pay for hired hands. Nevertheless:
 
.
..such a campaign could evoke only the most sympathetic
 
response among the Poles, the more so as they were interested
 
not only in the religious tuition of their children, but
 
also in securing an opportunity of teaching their vernacular
 
language. Turek 1967:220
 
Turek explains that the entire project was a misunderstanding
 
and, if enacted, would bring about the teaching of Ukrainian to
 
Polish
 
many/children. Ukrainian and not Polish was the national origin
 
ft. I am grateful to Dr. Tadeusz Radzialowskj who had helped me
 
in solving the puzzle.
 
of the majority of students in all but two of Manitoba '
ethnic'
 
highschools. The project seems never to have been actually enacted,
 
yet the books were printed and now witness the early attempts to
 
introduce bi-lingual education in Canada.
 
Not only were these books published in Chicago (which had
 
the main Polish publishing establishment), but,  judging from the
 
introduction,  there were intended to be used in Polish American
 
schools. Maybe the introduction was added at the last moment to
 
make the books salable in the American market. At this point we
 
have no information as to the actual distribution of these books
 
in the United States. Their tone is far from secular,  so these
 
books could have easily been used by parish schools in America.
 
Among their religious themes are prayers, poems about the might of
 
God, and stories about the moral,
 1
 
of giving charity to the poor
 
One may consider these
 
Polish textbooks, in spite of many borrowings app ent in the texts,
 
from the earlier Polish-American readers which in turn, as we have
 
noted, were based on Galician and other textbooks. The illustrations
 
situate us in A
xnerica:the farms and farm houses are North American,
 
the picture of 'a city' looks strikingly similar to the Chicago
 
water front:  schools,  streets, and factories are all of the new
 
and not the Old World.
 
MIASTO.
 
-
 
The cities cited as examples in the story accompanying this
 
drawing in the Second reader are: Chicago, New York, Krakow
 
and Warszawa.
 
Another excerpt entitled 'The Factory: takes the reader
 
into an iron factory and describes the work done there. It
 
elaborates on the lesson that the children learned as a result
 
of this expedition. Firts of all, their reaction:
 
When the children came out of the factory and saw the
 
sun,  sky,  trees, they sighed with relief and became solemn
 
for a long while. Seeing the hard work of these workers,
 
taught them respect for these people whose lives are spent
 
not on fun and play but in labor, among great dangers that
 
they are not always able to escape.
 
Factories are needed, though. And there are multitude
 
of them. Millions of people work in them:  they loose their
 
health,  sometimes even their lives, or else they become
 
permanent invalids. Second Manitoba Reader:  1916: 98
 
Lest anyone suspected that these readers contained social protest
 
or militant workers' complaints, it would suffice to point to
 
other readings in which it is explained, for example,  that poor
 
people should not feel bad as long as they have their health,  for
 
health is what constitutes real treasure. The above passage may
 
represent romantic dangers translated into modern life; it may
 
have also expressed the real feelings and fears of many workers.
 
Nevertheless, most of the readings taught acceptance of one's
 
role in the society:
 
.
..work then and be honest and God may help you, too.
 
For 'whom God created,  he will not let die of starvation',
 
as the old Polish proverb says
 
Second Manitoba Reader 1916:102
 
Aside for the interest in work and industry,  the Manitoba
 
series constitutes a simple continuation of earlier and contem c .
 
Polish American readers. It presents the same family values
 
and recites similar legends about the Polish American heroes:
 
m
e
 
Kosciuszko and Pulaski.
 
Before going into the religious Polish American textbooks
 
written and published by the Roman Catholic and the Polish
 
National churches,  let us take a closer look at a school in
 
New York at the St. Stanislaw parish located in lower Manhattan
 
at 108 E
F 7th Street. The year is 1916.

St. Stanislaw Polish Roman Catholic parish school. New York, NY,191 6 
In order to consider where and how the books discussed above
 
may had been used, let us utilize one of the Jubilee books that
 
was published to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the priest-
hood of the Reverand Jan Strz
.elecki,  the pastor of the St. Stanis-
laus church in New York.
 
Jubilee literature is a self conscious source written
 
explicitely for posterity and designed to memorialize and glorify
 
the present. This sort of source constitutes an invaluable material
 
for understanding the ideolo&rical bases of social phenomena that
 
are an important part of community efforts like the educational
 
system.
 
One of the major achievements of Father Strzelecki was prec.-
the
 
sely a parish school that he opened in 1907.
 He hired/Felician
 
ft.
 
Sisters to serve as teachers and by 1916 had eight
 
some 700 pupils. To this school, on many festive occ
 
pastor invited journalists from the ¶
'ygodnik Poiski (Polish Weekly)
 
which was published in New York. They wrote reports about the
 
school's exhibitions and its character and activities. A selection
 
of these articles appears in the jubilee book. As a part of the
 
system of Catholic parochial schools (which were a goal and duty
 
for all parishes to develop in view of the resolutions of
 
the Second Ecclesiastical Council of Baltimore in 1883),
 
St. Stanislaus was visited by the bishop's official school
 
inspector. The letter that resulted from this inspection
 
appears in the jubilee book. Thus this jubilee book provides
 
the reader with a variety of complimentary view points which

Who are the accusers? The point of reference here is still the
 
political leadership in Poland, who would have liked to see
 
American Polonia as an inteFral
 
political leadership in Poland, who would have liked to see
 
American Polonia as an integral part (or the fourth province of )
 
Poland.
 
To understand who should be concerned that the Poles in
 
America may be cosmopolitan, we have to continue with the compli-
cated if not convoluted proze of this passage:
 
For it would be natural to draw the conclusion that a
 
nation--or a part of it--until recently remaining under
 
prevelant traditions of own language and customs (after
 
emigrating) if it suddendly disposes of these traditions,
 
it would be much more likely to discard the (newly aquired)
 
language and customs of a nation that has been created
 
quite recently...
 
The cosmopolitan tendencies,
 
if we may try to elaborate on this
 
passage, are seen here as a threat not only to Polish, but also
 
to A
merican,  identity. People who loose their old loyalties
 
easily (and that in spite of many centuries of national and
 
cultural belonginess) are seen as poor material for citizens
 
of any country (and especially of a country which has very
 
young and not-quite-developed cultural forms--implicitely the United
 
States). It is implied that those who wish to switch and adopt
 
the new cultural patterns do so for utilitarian reasons, and such
 
Polish
 
motivations are deplorable in the/value system  and deemed -in-
advisable for any country.
 
Preserving the natioriã consciousness is seen as an avenue
 
winning respect from the host society, while forgetting it wil
 
bring upon the immigrants the host society's contempt and even
 
ill-treatment. This rationale may reflect in part the actual
 
experience of many immigrants who attempted to join in the main
 
stream of American life at the time. Though a small percentage
 
of immigrant families sent their children to public schools,
 
for example,  those who did only found out that-on the average-
there were twice as many "retarded" children among the immigrant
 
children that among American born parentage(  see 1911 Senate
 
Reports of the Immigration Commission: The Children of Immigrants
  
in Schools, P. 556). In Chicago, according to the same report,
 
for all elementary school pupils where the average "retardation"
 
for the native born was 19,9%,
 among Polish children the average
 
was 47%.
 More retarded children could be found only among South
 
Italians at that time. Among children between ten and 12 years
 
of age, this percentage dramatically increases, reaching for
 
the Poles 74%, beating even the South Italians in this statistic.
 
U.S  Senate report for 1911 states:
 there are several groups such
 
as Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovenian, and French-Canadian,  in
 
which nearly one-half comes into the retarded class." (p. 548)
 
Retardation in this report was defined as the necessity for a
 
student to spend more than the prescribed time to reach a given
 
grade. This is why, the older the student is the more likely for
 
him to be retarded. The stigma attached to this label is besides
 
the point here. The fact is that students attempting to enter
 
the main stream educational system found themselves at a considerab-
le disadvantage.  In a way,  they were treated with contempt,  just
 
as the Polish Jubilee'book claims.
 
And what does the Polish heritage consist of? It seems that
 
the author claims that the heritage in the course of the last century
 
was the defense of the Polish language
 
From the time when Poland lost its political being,
 
the nation inheritance has been small: in fact it consisted only
 
of the Faith of the forefathers,  the national language and the
 
memories of struggle and martyrdom. Because from that time on
 
a struggle began between the opressed nation and the oppressors:
 
stout resistance in defense of these values  . . .
The nation has been
 
and still is resisting and no one wt
hll succeed in taking away its
 
holy memories.  .
 Jubilee Book p. 417
 
The stout resistance in defense of the Pt
hlish language is juxtapposed
 
here to the attitude of shame that the assimilationist immigrants
 
often manisfest in relation to the Polish language.  So the prejudice
 
against Polish Americans is portraed here as a direct factor
 
of their 'denationalization' or their clumsy attempts to become
 
Americans. The only possible path of compromise is then proposed:
 
Actually,  it is quite easy to combine both the needs and
 
duty:  the need to learn English with the duty to preserve
 
our own national language in our Polish Churches and schools.
 
So lets us defend until death our holy Faith and the
 
beautiful language of our forefathers, and let us preserve
 
Polish customs,  so close to our hearts, which will enable
 
us to sing with clear conscience our sweet anthem: Poland
 
hasn't perish yet.
 
The second paragraph seems to point to the most important
 
sentimental attachment. It will remain to be seen how well the
 
Polish children could learn English in this particular school.
 
When the school of St. Stanislaus parish opened in 1908,
 
it had several Felician sisters who filled the classes and a
 
175 pupils divided into four grades. A journalist of the New
 
York based Polish weekly visited the school on the occasion of
 
an exhibit of students' work. He wrote:
 
We enter a large, well lit classroom of the lowest
 
grade with 148 children in it'
. At first glance, the meti-
culous cleansiness of the place strikes, and the order and
 
obedience of the pupils.
 
The work exhibited included samples of writing and
 
girls' need1ework ...a1l very well done especially when
 
you consider the age of most of the pupils (they were six
 
years old). They read well in Polish and in English and
 
sing in Polish Po.ldzcie o Dziatki and in English a vocal-
mimical song.
 
Tygodnik Polskj, June 1910 reprinted in the
 
Jubilee Book  
p. 424
 
Though it is hard to draw any conclusions about the school program on
 
the basis of the annual exhibit, it does seem that the school was
 
emphasising artistic work(painting) and needlepoint. The jubilee book
 
points out that the pastor himself was an artist. What were they
 
painting?
 
The best works include: a pencil portrait of a mideaval
 
pilgrim, a Guardian Angel watching over children playing
 
at the edge of an abyss (oil), St. John the Baptist (aquarel),
 
the Heart of Christ
 
(oil),  the portrait of Emeror
 Franz
 Joseph
 
in his youth (crayon), a portrait
 
of the Rev. Father Strzelecki (crayon),  then a very good
 
drawing of an Arabian stallion,  a stag at the rooting grounds
 
etc.
 .
 
425
 
Though the content of the prize winning paintings would seem to
 
indicate otherwise,  the journalist addressing his readers stressed
 
that this school was "not at all permeated with mere clerical
 
character--but to the contrary,  it had a general national
 
character." (p. 426) The pastor is quoted as saying that the
 
upward mobility of his parishioners is his aim:
 
I have been telling my parishioners that I don't want to
 
see them here always with a shovel. My aim is to see them
 
educated, nationally conscious,  in wealth,  on better jobs,
 
and respected by the Americans. p.427
 
The pastor pays tribute to the offerings of the parish community
 
and recognizes their role in maintainig the school. It sounds like
 
an echo of the activities of the Polish National Church which
 
split from the Roman Catholicism over the issue of parish property
 
The PNCC claimed that it was the collective property of the pari-
shioners, not the bishop's.
 
only in
 
Our school is Polish not because we teach/Polish langua&
'-e
 
here but because it is maintained by the labor and hard-
earned money of the Polish people. p. 14
.

It is stated that in fact,  only the Polish language and history
 
is taught in Polish while all the other subjects are taught in
 
English.
 
The relationship between students and teachers is assessed
 
in the book as very friendly. It may have seemed that way to people
 
accustomed to the overwhelming terror with which students often
 
regarded teachers in Poland. Questions are permitted in this
 
school that further the free development of intellect, it is
 
stated. The discipline is not compared to other schools in America.
 
The only actual scale of comparison that the Jubilee Book
 
affords,  is from the point of view of general Catholic education
 
in America. A letter to Father Strzelecki sent on 21 January,  1911
 
from the official school inspector of the New York diocese
 
commends the school for order,  cleansiness and '
sound discipline.'
 
The religious instruction is praised as is the teaching of the
 
'artistic subjects.'
 
Regarding the course in Religion,  I have only word s of
 
praise. Catechism and Bible-History are efficiently taught
 
and explained and every means is employed to develop in
 
the pupils a strong, practical,  and intelligent Catholicity.

As for the handling of English instructions,  the inspector saw
 
some room for improvement:
 
While the proper study of English (spoken and written)
 
is by no means neglected,  I should like to suggest that
 
somewhat greater emphasis be laid upon this very important
 
branch of the school curriculum. This work may be begun even
 
in the lowest grades by the Teacher, for example, reading
 
once or twice to the little ones a little legend or fable,
 
or incident from the Bible-History, and then having the
 
p
 pupils reproduce the story orally. From the third to the
 
sixth grades a story of description better suited to their
 
years might be employed, and the class required to write
 
from memory with attention to the rules of composition,
 
what has been read. Here,  too, dictation exercizes may be
 
used to good advantage.
 p. 431
 
How did they teach English in St. Stanislaus,  then? The earlier
 
assertion that the first graders "read well in Polish and English"
 
seems a little hard to believe. Maybe a few did, but surely not
 
the entire class of 148
. From the above quotation we find out
 
what the English instruction did not look like.
 
Finally,  the diocese school instructor suggests in his
 
characteristically polite way that the classes are overcrowded:
 
In the first two primary classes the Sisters in charge are
 
very creditable work, notwithstanding the high numbers
 
W e re  it possible to divide these classes,  I am sure that
 
eve n  g re ate r  p ro gre s s  would be made.  p. 431
 
The inspector did not mention the progress made in Polish, nor
 
did he mention mathematics: only religion and art were commended.
 
English was to be improved and classes should be subdivided if
 
at all possible.
 
Be fo re  g oi n g  i nt o  the actual program of instruction,  let us
 
do
  
look at yet another important part of the cultural expression
 
practiced in this as well as most other Polish parochial schools
 
at the time.  These were various forms of theatricals organized
 
either annually to celebrate holidays or periodically to observe
 
an especially important for Polish consiousness, anniversary.
 
On January 29, 1915,  the school celebrated the anniversary
 
of the January (1863) Uprising,  the last of a series of armed
 
uprisings in the nineteenth century against the Russians. When
 
the curtain went up, hundreds of gathered spectators saw the following:
 
On the back of the stage there was a huge cross with the
 
dates of the most important historical events on its arms:
 
177 2- 1793-1795,  the partitions, and 1863,  the January Uprising.
 
On both sides of the cross flags were hanging: Polish and
 
American. At the feet of the cross, kneeled handcuffed  '
Poland'
 
(
 a girl pupil) with her head rested on the cross and her eye:-
fixed on it,  looking up to it f
c
 
p. 1+32
 
This image would seem incomprehensibi
 Un n anci now,
 
yet it is a simple emblem of nineteenth century Polish nationalism
 
in its religious version developed by the Resurrectionist Order.
 
This order sought deliverance from national dependence in divine
 
intervention.  The Polish nation was viewed, after the romantic
 
national bard had coined this image, as contemporary embodiment of
 
the suffering of Christ--hence the cross. The boned girl looks
 
up to the cross for liberation from these bonds. What did this
 
philosophy exclude was earthly means of regaining national
 
independence.  In the text there is actually explicit reference to
 
Mickiewicz's 183 0 poem,  'the Bible of Polish Exiles which is a
 
source of most of the symbolism of Poland as the Christ of Nations.
 
The writer of this report in 1915 offers his comments:
 
It was a beautiful and sad scene, and many of the spectators
 
were deeply moved seeing Poland, our country, once a
 
powerful state, now handcuffed at the feet of the cross like
 
a prostrated sinner. But was Poland really the sinner? No:
 
Our bard, Mickiewicz,  says in the Books of Polish Pilgrimage:
 
And the martyrized the Polish Nation
 
And laid it into a grave, while kings
 
Called: we killed
 
and buried Freedom.
 
On both sides of the scene,  there stood fourteen girls
 
gowned in white with long black veils, each holding a bouquet of
 
flowers. One by one they stepped up,  said a poem and threw the
 
flowers towards the feet of the cross where Poland knelt. More
 
readings of Mickiewicz's poetic prose from the Books of Polish
  
Pilgrimage closed this solems ceremony during which tears were
 
shed by the audience. The passive and romanticized attitude
 
towards Polish national re-birth that the Roman Catholic clergy
 
in general and the Resurrectionist Order in particular were
 
accused by the :
Polish American secular organizations of promoting,
 
was well illustrated by this spectacle.
 
By 1915,  the school had over 700 pupils in eight grades.
 
We quote here from the description of the curriculum for the
 
eighth grade:
 
Program and list of subjects taught in the St. Stanislaus
 
school in New York.
 
Program for the eighth grade.
 
Morning.
 
After the mass,  the instructions begin with a prayer,  then
 
a lecture on mathematics wich includes the complete course
 
according to the State of New York requirenmen -t
s with beginnings
 
of algebra and 15 minutes of recreation. Then the religious
 
instruction given by a priest including: Higher Catechism
 
(Monday and Thursday),  Churc
h History (Tuesdays), Bible
 
History (Wednsdays), Liturgy of Church ritual (Friday )
.
 
At 10:30 a lecture on English Grammar and,  connected with
 
it, instruction in Polish Grammar to enhance the children's
 
understanding. There is also the teaching of writing of trade
 
letters,  friendly letters, and announcements etc. Besides
 
a sketch of English literature is taught as well as Polis
 
literature in prose and poetry.
 
Afternoon.
 
English reading and review of periodical press, syllabizing
 
(reading aloud one syllable after another before making the
 
syllables into a word--EH) with translations into Polish
 
(literally: into the national tongue--EH).
 
Geography of the whole Earth, its structure,  topography,
 
nations and their civilizations,  occupations and progress.
 
Botany is added and mineralogy and physics.
 
Learning about the history of the United States and its
 
development and the socio-political system of this country,
 
its federal and state governments. We do not, of course,
 
omit,  the history of the Polish Nation:  the children are
 
7
 being aquianted with the glorious past of our forefathers
 
which should encourage them to work for the national cause
 
(literally  '
to work in the national spirit" El
i) to bring
 
about a better fate to our nation. The learning of physio-
logy and good manners.
 
Besides their own books, the students of the eigth grades
 
and of other higher grades, may utilize our school library.
 
It includes Catholic and secular books in the English language.
 
Among others, it has huge dictionaries, resting on separate
 
tables and a great number of books in both Polish and English
 
literatures, all as a result of the generosity of the pastor.
 
The library is still growing.

(The English subjects are printed in English--El
i)
 
The scope and the number of subjects decrease in each grade,
 
though they are taught several religious subjects in all of them.
 
The two first grades are taught entirely in Polish,  though
 
already in the first grade the students receive some English:
 
"the phonetic method of reading in Polish and English is employed,"
 
reads program for the first grade.
 
It would be very useful to compare this program to a prog-
ram of a public school at the same time to the educational merits

Let us start with the one that encompassed some 7
5 to 80% of
 
the members of Polish community in America,  the traditional
 
Roman Catholic parishes.
 The books that were published for the
 
use of the Polish Roman Catholic parishes, all came after the
 
World War I from the printers of the St. Hedwig's monastery:
'.
-
-
in
 
Niles,  Ill ., which was the official printery of the Felician
 
Order of teaching nuns  originally brought from Poland in 1974
 
preceisely for stuffing the teaching posts in parochial schools.

Felician Sisters Textbooks 
There are two series of the Felician textbooks:  the first con-
sisting of a Primer and eight readers, where were all published in
 
the 1920s,  the second including only four readers published in the
 
1930s but accompanied by an additional two volume work on Polish
 
history, geography, and culture, entitle Polska. 
Both series
 
devote a rather large proportion of their content to religion.
 An
 
overwhelming majority of illustrations in each depict religious
 
themes.
 The first was anonymous; the second was written by the
 
Felician sister,  Mary Cyrila.
 The second series is therefore quite
 
uniform, not only in its style and the form of its presentation,
 
but also with respect to its format,  illustrations, and general
 
appearance.
 
Reflecting the times when they appe'red,  these books lack the
 
earlier textbooks'  ambivalence concerning the issue of national
 
identity.
 Unlike the earlier textbooks,  these were written by and
 
for Americans of Polish descent  (and not for Poles living in Amer-
ica).
 Nevertheless they remain almost entirely in the Polish
 
language,  though the American identity is stressed while the Polish
 
identity is preserved as a sort of sentimental addition.
 
The 1920s series is not original.
 There are several passages
 
that are simply lifted from the earlier textbooks.
 For example,  in
 
the Fifth Reader  (Piata Czytanka), published in 1926,  there are
 
whole excerptp taken directly from the 1889 Fourth Reader published
 
-

 Hauser
 
in Chicago.
 The texts in the 1920 series are not exact copies of
 
their earlier prototype.
 In the Felician Sisters' version they are
 
often shortened and simplified  (
i.e. pp.  311-314 of the Fifth
 
Reader repeat pp 116-118 of the 1889 reader but omit the scenes of
 
lynching in the South)
 
The first two readers in the 1920 series present no history of
 
geography:  these subjects are first introduced on a rather modest
 
scale in the Third Reader.
 The Third Reader,  for no apparent rea-
son,  is divided into four sections titled Fall, Winter,  Spring,  and
 
Summer.
 In each section there are a few stories pertaining to the
 
Polish past and the great kings.  There are also stories about the
 
Polish American hero,  Thadeusz Kosciuszko.
 The historical as well
 
as the purely fictitious exemplary characters are all introduced in
 
the same manner:  they all serve to provide the reader with moral
 
models.
 Dates are not given for their lives nor is chronology
 
maintained in the sequence of their presentation.
 
In general the majority of the texts are located in rur
 
roundirigs.
 The Third  (
1923)  reader presents the archetypica
 
rural-urban opposition and uses Warsaw as its example of a city.
 
The values stressed include--besides the stress of religious
 
observance-- strong familial  love and solidarity, respect for
 
private property,  rules for proper conduct, and table manners.
 The
 
order of allegiance taught in these books is well expressed in the
 
poem "To a Polish Child," which áppears in the Third Reader:  "What
 
should I love,  a child asks? God,  Family and Fatherland."

The Fifth,  Sixth,  and Seventh Readers are arranged into ten
 
chapters, each headed by the name of a month from September to
 
June.
 Each monthly reading ends with a "review of Polish history"
 
for that month,  a grammar lesson, and exersizes.
 In each monthly
 
reading there is a bit of American history,  some geography, and
 
some botany  (often lifted from other textbooks).
 Polish history is
 
provided in more detail than American history, with an emphasis on
 
the lives of the kings,  saints,  and other prominent figures.
 
Themes like the social structure of Polish society or even the
 
liberation of the peasants in the nineteenth century are not men-
tioned at all.
 Instead,  an emphasis is put on illuminating the
 
ties that existed between Polish statehood and the Catholic Church.
 
Poland is portrayed as the rampart of Christianity,  on
 
tiers of the non-Christian world.
 For example,  in the
 
Reader,  the crucial period of Polish statehood between
 
fifteenth and the eighteenth centuries is treated in a

of exile;  both topics that are central to Polish literature and
 
that acquired special meaning for Poles in the United States.
 The
 
nineteenth-century selections include poems by Maria Konopnicka,
 
whose writings relfect much of the social injustice prevalent in
 
her time and seek to defend poor,  helpless peasants.
 She was espe-
cially venerated by the schismatic Polish National Church.
 The
 
Nobel Prize winner, Wladyslaw Reymont, who wrote an epic novel,
 
Peasants, all appears.
 
As the author of the textbook announces in
 
the introduction,  the reason book intends to popularize Polish
 
literature among the uneducated.
 It seems that it was meant not so
 
much for use in schools as it was for the use of adults in the Pol-
ish American community in general.
 The introduction begins:
 
Encouragement for the Propagation of Polish Letters
 
We Poles are rightly proud of our rich and great litera-
ture that takes a prominent place among Europe's best
 
literatures.
 Many Polish writers are translated intc
 
foreign languages  (Mickiewicz has been translated in
 
nine and Sienkiewicz into nearly all civilized tongues).
 
Yet, unfortunately this beautiful heritage, available to
 
foreigners in translation is entirely lost on Polish peo-
ple of lower social standing.
 Only a handful of Polish
 
craftsmen or peasants could tell you anything about
 
Kochanowski,  Skarga,  Krasicki, Mickiewicz, Slowacki,
 
Krasinski,  Zaleski, and Pol....Knowledge of our nations
 
great literature is needed by the lower classes and is
 
especial'ly needed by the youth....
 This knowledge awakes
 
national  consciousness,  pride,  and  love of our Father-

Poland,  and visit all the major Polish cities including, of course,
 
Wilno and Lwow.
 They learn bits of Polish history while reading
 
about these places and monuments.
 They also learn about the inha-
bitants of the cities.
 There is almost no description of the coun-
try side, no factories visited,  nor,  in general,  nothing that might
 
seem the least bit unpleasant.
 Pride in Polish independence,  free-
dom,  and military strength permeates this example of the new atti-
tude toward Polish identity.
 Though the children are described as
 
being fascinated with Poland,  they all very happily reembark on the
 
Josef Pilsudski after the tour and sail back "home." We will return
 
to Sister Cyrila's treatment of Polish history and geography later.
 
In general,  this series presents a uniform set of values for
 
moral,  religious,  and political guidance:
 
I am and will remain a Christian.
 
We have a Franciscan mission in our church.
 
My answer was no -liked by that Lutheran.
 
I will vote Republican.
 
I will not read books written by a pagan.
 
The pastor thanked his parishoners for t
..
 
Our knowledge of Sister Cyrila's background is limited to the
 
information presented in a short entry to Who is Who in Polish
  
America which states that she was born in Manistee, Michigan,  stu-
died both in the United States  (
it does not say where)  and at War-
saw University.
 Her books were -
'first published between 1933 and
 
1939.
 It was in 1939 that she was decorated with the Golden Cross
 
of Merit in W rsaw as a special distinction by the World Alliance
 
-
 44 -
 Hauser
 
of Poles in recognition of her contribution to the field of Polish
 
education.
 
It is not surprising that Sister Cyrila was honored in Poland,
 
which in general during the interwar period was especially
 
interested in strengthening the ties between the independent State
 
of Poland and the Polish American community.
 The Polish government
 
sent several educators to begin work in the field of Polish Amer-
can education  (
see below on supplementary education).
 Si
 
Cyrila represented the political and ideological  line of
 
tially conservative, nationalistic tendencies within the Polish
 
political structure.
 In her book, mainly devoted to Polish his-
tory,  she devotes a chapter to the leader of the nationalistic and
 
programmatically anti-semitic National Democratic party, Romuald
 
D
rnowski, quoting an evaluation of him by Western observers at the
 
Vers ail l e  co nf e r e n ce  as  "t he  g r e a tes t  st ates ma n  of  o ur  ti mes. "
 
In terms of style and presentation of her material it seems
 
that Sister Cyrila remained under the profound influence of the
 
Polish sentimental poets.
 Some of her stories in the lower-grade
 
readers are prose paraphrases of Brodzinski's poems.
 In the entire
 
series the concentration of sentimental phrases, diminutives,  and
 
sentimental themes is probably higher than in any book printed in
 
the Polish language in Poland.
 In this series, xenophobia encom-
passed more than just the Jews.
 In a characteristic story entitled
 
"On Whose Side is the Truth?" defensive nationalism  (a reaction to
 
what was perceived as foreign prejudice)  is presented. This excerpt
 
is from the fpurth grade reader entitled Moje mile Rozrywki (My
 
-
 45 -
 Hauser
 
Nice Diversions)
 
On Whose Side is Truth? 
Tadzik was a curious boy.
 He
 
asked about every thing and wanted to know about every
 
thing.
 Above all he liked to read about famous men,
 
heros and fighters.
 He knew about famous Polish kings,
 
heros,  scholars, and saints.
 He loved America,  since it
 
was his own country, he was born in America and he was
 
well of f here, but he also knew about the Fatherland of
 
the Poles so far across the ocean.
 He loved Poland and
 
respected her,  since it was the country of his parents,
 
grand parents,  and great great grand parents.
 He spoke
 
well in English and in Polish.
 His friends, who knew
 
only English,  called him "The Double Smart Teddy."
 
One day Tadzik returned from school sour, unhappy, upset,
 
as if bees had stung him.
 He didn't eat, didn't want to
 
go to the park to play football.
 He just buried himself
 
in books,  searching for something.
 
"Tadzik, why aren't you going to have some fresh air?"
 
asked his father,  "You have to freshen up your head and
 
then tomorrow studying will be much easier."
 
"I have to prove to this stupid little German boy that
 
the truth is on my side."
 
"What is the matter?"
 
"It's about Mikolaj Kopernik.
 Imagine this, daddy:
 
Wilhelm Henberg stubbornly claims that Mikolaj Kopernik
 
was German,  not Polish.
 But I know that he was Polish
 
and Poland sings about him:
 
-
 46 -
 Hauser
 
He stopped the sun. He moved the earth,
 
The Polish nation gave him birth.
 
I learned that in school.
 But how can I Convince the
 
German about that?
 "Show me," he says,  "where it is
 
written that Mikolaj Kopernik was a Pole."
 
"It is written,  my son,  in all histories that were not
 
falsified.
 But this is not the way to convince the Ge:
 
man • "
 
"So how can I convince him that the truth is on my side?
 
You have to prove this by your life.
 You have to become
 
a worthy son of Poland--this great,  famous, enlightened,
 
knightly, heroic and holy Poland.
 You have to live as a
 
Pole should live, that is according to the teachings of
 
the holy Lord from Nazareth.
 Because only such a nation
 
will bring forth truly enlightened,  famous and great peo-
ple.
 Such was Mikolaj Kopernik who was born in the Pol-
ish city of Torun.
 In the Polish University in Krakow he
 
studied,  counted, measured the heavenly firmament until
 
he shouted to the sun:  Stop!
 And he proved to the world
 
that not the sun around the earth but the earth around
 
the sun revolves.
 
"Tadzik, be a devoted son of the Great and Independent
 
State of Poland,  and then the little stupid German Hen-
berg, and all the little stupid Germans, will bow down
 
their heads to Poland and to all her Sons."
 
Tadzik became wistful for a moment and then shouted:  "I
 
will be,  like Mikolaj Kopernik, the pride of Poland and
 
-
 47 - 
Hauser
 
her Sons."
 
As we see from this story,  the books of Sister Cyrila were
 
written in a Polish American setting.
 She went to special trouble
 
to adjust the books to what she called the "mentality of the Polish
 
American child."  In an introduction to her series she wrote:
 
We receive many history textbooks sent to us from our
 
Motherland.
 These textbooks are written in beautiful
 
Polish,  they contain rich and intriguing material, and
 
arouse love for our country's history.
 They also have a
 
high pedagogical value.
 Blessed results will be achieved
 
when these books are used in our Motherland.
 
But for our Polish children in America, only these text-
books present a real pedagogical value, which can be
 
adapted to the mind of a child born here.
 Textbooks from
 
Poland lack this quality.
 To fill this gap we wrote the
 
following books of Polish history prepared especially for
 
our Polish children in America.
 
These books go to some lengths to make the otherwise obscure his-
tories of Polish kings and Polish victories as relevant as possible
 
to an American born child.
 We have already mentioned the devise of
 
a trip to Poland by a group of Polish American children.
 All his-
tory is presented in this way--as it appears to a Polish American.
 
As for the relevance of the content of these books to the
 
times they describe,  it must be said that the inflated and romanti-
cized image of Poland was meant to counteract and overcome the ear-
-
 48 -  
Hauser
 
h er images of Poland as a martyred and destitute Victim.
 Though
 
the motivation was noble,  the results seem to produce yet another
 
mystification for the use of American Polonia.
 The question "What
 
is Poland?" appears on the first page of the 1934 children's his-
tory of Poland.  The answer reads:
 
Poland, my dear children,  is a glorious,  once formidable,
 
huge, wealthy,  and famous country on the other side of
 
the sea where our parents, grandparents,  and great grand
 
parents were born.
 
The size of Poland was also exaggerated somewhat:
 
In Europe,  Poland is the most fertile land.
 It connects
 
as if by a bridge the Baltic and the Black seas,  and,  at
 
the time of its greatness,  fed half the world.
 
The territorial claims here made surpass even the demands of the
 
most extreme Polish nationalists--but that Poland was Europe's
 
chief producer of wheat in the sixteenth century is a fact.
 Proud
 
of Poland, nevertheless American,  this is how the Polish American's
 
ordered their allegiances:
 
Finally,  Poland is us,  dear children.
 Though we were
 
born in America and we breath freely under the star span-
gled banner of golden freedom# and we love this banner .
 
To defend it we will fight,  to defend it we will all sb
 
our blood and we will give'our lives.
 And rightly so,
 
because we own a lot, a tremendous amount to our adopted
 
Fatherland,  America.
 (
It is never explained in what way,
 
-
 49 -
 Hauser
 
then,  "Poland is us")  When the cruel enemy had taken our
 
land away from us and sentenced our nation to homeless-
ness and exile,  America took us in.
 She does not per-
secute us.
 She does not try to extort our language or
 
beliefs.
 She lets us develop and educate in our own Pol-
ish,  spiritual culture,  in our beautiful Polish national
 
and Christian tradition.
 So we love our adopted Father-
land as our own.
 But we cannot forget that we are Amen-
cans of Polish descent.
 We cannot forget that it is Pol-
ish blood that flows in our veins,  that we have a Polish
 
heart,  that the Fatherland of Poles is that Poland far
 
away over the ocean.
 
In the final  lines of this statement the sense in which we all are
 
Polish is finally expressed.
 It was in the nineteenth century
 
understanding of nationality as a biological inheritance and not as
 
a cultural construct that the author sought the compelling reasons
 
for Polish Americans, who were otherwise totally committed to Amer
 
ica,  to "not forget their origins." The very last words seem to be
 
saying that although we are Americans, as biological Poles we have
 
our natural Fatherland far far away in Poland.
 
Nationalism,  thus understood, takes nature to be a basis for
 
national allegiance.
 Yet it is not imperative enough,  as it is
 
quite possible for biological Poles to loose contact culturally
 
with Poland.
 Thus cultivating the national tradition is a cultural
 
activity that is in agreement with nature.
 
Tracing the origin of Poles, Sister Cynila states some general
 
-
 50 -
 Hauser
 
information about nations.
 She says that all nations are distinct
 
from one another by language,  custom, and descent.
 Though Slays
 
are described as generally quiet, hard-working, hospitable,  musi-
cal,  they have some vices:
 
'
I
 These fl
ws persist even today.
 Poles did not escape
 
them either.
 It happens often that a Pole will not sup-
port a Pole.
 He will prefer to support a Jew over his
 
own countryman,  another Pole.
 It is unfortunate, but
 
such is the truth.
 We must work as hard as we possibly
 
can to clear our Polish hearts of these vices.
 
Actually,  in view of the assumption that discord is one of the
 
major traits that Poles inherited,  is it really possible to change
 
and free oneself of the internal discord that leads to lack of
 
solidarity?
 Besides, nineteenth-century nationalistic ideas,  the
 
books also repeat the programmatic line of the Polish Roman
 
Catholic Union  (the major Polish American religious organization)
 
that always claimed--in opposition to the secular model of Polish
 
identity-- that a true Pole must be a Catholic.
 
Before summing up the Catholic textbooks,  let us take a closer
 
look at the most basic readers by Sister Cyrila, books whose con-
tent was much less overtly political, but which had the largest
 
circulation.
 It is estimated that some seventy-six percent of Pol-
ish children went through at least the lower grades of the paro-
chial schools.
 These textbooks -
'have been reprinted many times and
 
used in the parochial schools
 
ish, which is' until about 1950.

country which
 
In the second
 
a short dialo-
is the favorite form of presentation in
 
Whose Queen is it?
 
Did Mama see her when Mama went to Poland?
 
No, my dear.  This sweet queen is long since dead.
 Today
 
she looks down from Heaven on Polish children.
 
The Polish language is always referred to as the language in which
 
we pray.
 But most stories are about children who are always busy
 
playing.
 They color books and show it to their dogs who admire the
 
colored books,  play with balloons, blow bubbles,  talk to flowers,
 
water flowers,  pick up lost kittens and feed pigeons.
 
Children in the stories are told to be good and to give to
 
charity, always with the understanding that God sees good deeds and
 
repays them.
 Being good is defined as going with mama to church
 
and "being an
 
rewards, here
 
angel" there.
 Good children are promised many
 
and
 in heaven.
 One of the most important preroga-
tives of goodness is love for one's parents, grandparents, an
 
teachers.
 Love is best shown by giving the parents flowers o
.
 
their namedays and obeying them every day.
 Obedience,  love, and
 
respect for one's parents is both God's commandment and a natural
 
desire of the child's heart.
 This is stated repeatedly.
 It is
 
also in the best interest of the child.
 There is a gruesome story
 
in all the re ders about the effects of disobedience.
 Already in
 
52 -
 Hauser
 
the second reader children can find out what happens to a boy who
 
does not listen to his mother and Sister-teacher and runs in front
 
of a car.
 The reader vividly describes the crash and states that
 
when the bloody body of the boy was pulled from underneath the car,
 
he was dead.
 It ends with the moral:  "If little Ludwick had
 
listened to his mother and to the Sister-teacher, he would not have
 
gone to the grave so soon"  (p.  89).
 A similar story about a boy
 
who played with fire crackers and was blinded appears in the Third
 
reader.
 
As we
 
occupation
 
reason for
 
have already mentioned, the problem of future work,
 
and careers is never mentioned in these books.
 The only
 
poverty depicted is personal tragedy,  such as the death
 
of a breadwinner.
 This
 
were written during the
 
suffered unemployment.
 
is particularly striking since the books
 
Great Depression and many Polish families
 
In one of the stories, a poverty stricken
 
widow barely survives with her orphaned son, a ten year old boy who
 
has to make a living as a paper boy.
 His mother's income earned
 
taking in washing does not suffice to pay their living expenses.
 
The father has been dead for five years and they look with tears in
 
their eyes at his grave  (which must be in their backyard)  as they
 
prepare the feast on Christmas Eve.
 (Poles celebrate Christmas

time,  an envoy from God,  in some sort of disguise.  There is,  for
 
example, a custom of leaving an extra setting for a stranger and
 
often strangers or poor people are actually invited to share this
 
most intimate family dinner.)  In this New-World version of an Old-
World folk tale,  the poor stranger is substituted for by a stranger
 
representing the American way of life.
 His name is Mr. Robins.
 He
 
is the owner of a factory.
 Impressed by the poor boy's honesty he
 
comes to reward this rare virtue.
 He gives the boy some money,  but
 
most impbrtant, he offers the widow a steady job in his factory
 
from that day on and takes it upon himself to educate the boy with
 
the understanding that once the boy graduates, he will become a
 
personal assistant to the owner.
 There is a sequel.
 We see the

 He now
 
lives with his mother in a beautiful home and is a manager in the
 
factory.
 
This story reaffirms society's status quo by promising that
 
virtue and hard work bring rewards.
 Moreover,  if we compare this
 
story to conventional notions of charity in the nineteenth century,
 
we find that it both agrees with and subverts received ideas of
 
this virtue.
 Elson points out that nineteenth-century readers
 
stress both the benefits of giving charity and the small cost of
 
the gesture.

fable of virtue rewarded developed interesting variants in the Pol-
ish National Church when we consider that institution below.
 
When we look at the general patterns of presentation and omis-
sion in these books,  two things are striking: a disregard for the
 
economic contingencies under which Poles lived in Poland and in the
 
United States and severe mystification of Polish history as
 
presented to Polish Americans.
 For example,  there is no mention of
 
serfdom pf the fact that serfs were liberated,  that there was lit-
tle employment available in Poland for poor and dispossessed
 
peasants,  and that this,  in fact  (and not political oppression due
 
to Poland's loss of independence)  brought the ancestors of the Pol-
ish Americans to this country.
 These distortions appear in the
 
historical knowledge of Polish Americans.
 While conductir

history interviews in a community of Polish textile workers ir
:
 
England,  I was struck and puzzled by their insistence that Polar
 
had never experienced serfdom.
 When you examine the books which
 
Polish American students read,  the puzzle is solved. Of course
 
post-World War II history books in communist Poland try to overcom-
pensate for these distortions by portraying the history of Poland
 
in terms of the ever growing exploitation of peasants.
 Neither
 
history strives for objectivity.
 
Let us now look at a very different series of books.
 It was
 
published in the United States at roughly the same time that the
 
Felician sisters textbooks, but it was designed for the use of the
 
Polish religi9us minority,  the members of the Polish National

Church that was created in 1897 as a result of the break from the
 
Polish Roman Catholic parishes.
 It is often stressed that the PNCC
 
became the only successful schism of the Catholic Church in Amer-
ica.
 There were attempts to create other schisms within different
 
ethnic churches,  but only the Polish National Church endured over
 
the years to become in the 1930s a powerful organization sanctioned
 
by the Old Catholic Church of Holand and entering into Intercommun-
ion with the American Episcopal denomination.

Polish National Catholic Church textbooks.  
I examined only five early textbooks produced by this
 
church between 1934 and 1956.
 The Library of Congress does not
 
have aky of them and I had to borrow them on Interlibrary Loan
 
from the Pawtucket Public Library in Pawtucket,  R
.I. which has
 
one of the most interseting collections of Polish and Polish American
 
books on the East Coast. The scope of the educational endevours
 
of the Polish schismatics was far less than the Roman Catholic
 
educational system, partly because it was a new and not well
 
established institution, partly because education had never become
 
an integral part of the PNCC program. The creation of the church
 
occured as a result of tension between parishioners and the Roman
 
Catholic clergy (and especially the non-Polish,American Catholic
 
hierarchy) over parish property, dues and fees for funerals.  It
 
originated in the anthracite mining district of Pennsylvania. Today
 
the center of the denomination, its Cathedral and Bishop's residence,
 
all are also located in Scranton, Pa.  In the first decades of the
 
twentieth century, in the majority of Polish American C
 
part of the community seceded from the Roman Catholic C

create a new congregation and join with the PNCC. For more in±
 
tion on the history of the church see Kubiak 1970, Andrews 1953,
 
Fox 1957, Hauser 1981.
 
At the root of the Polish National Church,  the national
 
concerns were closely intertwined with the socio-economic issues.
 
The rebels against Catholic hierarchy were Polish miners who
 
naively believed that since they built the churches and schools
 
in America,  they were also collective owners of them. Those who
 
actively opposed their claims to parish property were 'foreign'
 
bishops: usually Irish or German. After the mission to the Pope
 
in 1897
 that asked for substantive concessions for the Polish
 
churches in America failed to bring about any positive results,
 
and the leader of the dissenters,  Father Hodur, was excommunicated ,
 
the schism became a reality.  One of the first resolution that
 
was adopted by the new church was to perform the liturgy in
 
Polish vernacular. In the textbooks I examined,  it is stated
 
repeatedly that the first mass ever said in the Polish language
 
took place in America, in the Scranton Polish National Church.
 
Since the followers of Father Hodur have always been a minority
 
within a minority,  their own local history constitutes an important
 
part of the textbooks.
 
The original founders of the church did not begin to think
 
about education, it seems, until their own children were sufferjnp
-
from a lack of parochial education. During the Sejm (Polish for
 
Parliament) of the Polish National Union (the leading PNCC lay orga-
nization) in Brooklyn, NY in September 1927 the first resolution
 
concerning writing and publishing textbooks for school use was
 
adopted. Father Bronislaw Krupski was entrusted with writing the
_
'
 
firts original Polish National primer. He explains:
 
This primer is original to the extent that I tried to include
 
notions and concepts stemming from the teachings of the
 
National Church:  to aqulant our children, ith regard to their
 
(young) age-) with all that with which they will live when th
 
grow up. I wanted to contribute to the building of a new type of a ioie
  
from the very beginning.
 Introductory word The Prmer

4th edition 1956
 
What was the  'new type of Pole? An analysis of the textbooks will
 
hopefully furnish some answers.
 
Most of the stories in the textbooks are set in Scranton and
 
its vicinity. Though the PNCC had four dioceses by the 1930s,  the
 
original place of its creation represented the beginnings and
 
of this denomination. The stories depict the highlights of the
 
PNCC's early history. They talk about the church's founder,  Rev.
 
Hodur, and they describe the Union's farm in Pensyivanja to which
 
the children go for vacation and which is a common property of
 
all the believers. It also describes the beautiful Cathedral in
 
Scranton and the cementary in which Rev. Hodur is burn ed. The
 
books have almost no reference to Poland and they are i

instead deeply rooted in the local scenery and folklore. A local
 
version pf a Polish dance is printed in the Primer (Krakowiak
 
w Scranton) along with the PNCC anthem and some Polish hyms.
 
The Primer also introduces the National school as part of
 
community life. The similarity in organization with the Roman
 
Catholic parish school is striking:
 
This is our Cathedral
 
It is an old and beautiful building
 
This church was built by Reverend Bishop Hodur long time ago
 
under the Cathedral there is a Polish American school
 
This is our school

Older children sing in a q choir during the mass

In school we learn both Polish and English
 
Primer 1956 p. 117
 
While describing the town of Scranton in a similar short rea
 
±kM it is stated that "In Scranton and vicinity they mine anthracite.
 
The miners work underground." The emphasis on work,  its description
 
and appreciation is one feature that distinguish these textbo ks
 
from their Roman Catholic counterpart.
 
Besides the Polish National history and the emphasis on work,
 
other themes of this primer are quite similar to the P&lish Roman
 
Catholic books. There are didactic stories about j
bhe vice of idelness,
 
the virtue of frugality familial love) and solidarity.
 
The second edition of the original primer appeared in 1962
 
in a substantially smaller form (from the first edition 151  pages
 
it was reduced to barely 80). Unlike the first one, which was
 
for the use of regular parochial elementary schools,  the second
 
edition was for the use of Polish National Church's  aturday
 
schools and supplemtary education. The maintenance of parish
 
school without the financial backing of a powerful organization
 
such as the Roman Catholic Church, proved too ambitious.
 
Bishop Hodur personally approved of the first reader (1931);
 
"I examined this book and recommended it to the Reverand pastors
 
and Teachers of the Polish National Church,"signed July 4th,  1933
 
in Scranton.
 This reader is an enlargement of the material
 
presented in the original primer. It also has a history of the
 
church, some sketches of its buildings,  the Polish and the
 
PNCC anthems ) a poem by Bishop Hodur and legends. Among the-., 
legends is one I describe earlier about princes Wands,  the
 
daughter of the founder of Krakow, who died rather than marry
 
a German. There are also readings about nature, natural phenomena,
 
animals, and vegetation.
 
While reading the stories in this and other Polish National
 
Church's textbooks, it strikes one that the same theme often
 
appears in the textbook of the Roman Catholic church, but that the
 
resolutions are different. The differences between the two series
 
reflect the different ideologies of the two churches.
 
For example,  the Felician Sisters'  textbooks as well as the early
 
Polish American books are full of gruesome stories about a child
 
who prays to God for re-unification with a dead parent. As I
 
mentioned above, in a society that is heavily dependent on familial
 
solidarity for survival, an incomplete family creates a problem
 
for everybody:  in symbolic terms, a child deprived of mother's
 
care is better off dead.  In the present reader, a story appears
 
about a boy whose mother died, his relatives had taken him to see
 
her but had told him to make sure to be quiet because she was
 
'
sleeping'  etc. They boy, as would be characteristic for a Roman
 
Catholic story, goes to the cemetery every day and spends a
 
considerable amount of time just sitting next to the grave.
 
However,  instead of asking his mother to take him with her to
 
heaven, he decides to create music as the nightingale does
 
who sings in the trees of the cemetery. He takes a violin and
 
eventually becomes a fameous violinist who also plays a concert
 
at the cemetery. Instead of dying, he assumes strength and
 
inspiration from his attachment to his dead mother.  One could also
 
interpret this story's resolution in terms of American influen-
ces and the theme of persuit of happiness, emphasis on individual
 
achievemen7etc.: all totally abscent from the Roman Catholic
 
tradition as expressed in the above discussed textbooks. This
 
interpretation would strengthen the view of the PNCC as a typically
 
American and typically ethnic phenomenon.
 
In the PNCC folklore, which also overtly resembles the content
 
of folklore used in the Roman Catholic Polish textbooks,  the
 
difference lies in substantive secularization of folklore and in
 
being aware of this secularization. Jaselka for example, defined
 
in the first reader as "a stage performance of actual or fantastic
 
events connected with the birth of Jesus Christ...used to be more
 
religious and was al ways performed in churches. Now Jaselka has
 
a more wordly character and this is why we hold them in halls." p.39
 
Another important example of taking  p the same St0rY and
 
Another important example of taking up the same story and
 
opting for a different resolution and moral is the story of a
 
paper boy's upward mobility. In the readers of the second Feli-
cian series, a poor boy is rewarded for his exemplary honesty
 
by the owner of a factory, Mr. Robins. The paper boy's mother
 
is given a job and he receives an education,  eventually becoming
 
an assistant to the owner.
 
The PNCC version also presents a paper boy whose fate is ul-
timately altered as a direct result of his selling the papers.
 
Instead of insisting on the rich man receiving his due change,
 
as it was in the Felician reader, in the National version,  the
 
boy himself gives a paper to a man who has no money to pay for
 
the paper. The receipient turns out to be not a factory owner
 
as in the Felician version, but an unemployed foreman who finds
 
a job in his trade among the adds in the paper's very issue that
 
the boy gave him with no charge. He is grateful, appears at the
 
boy's home, pays him for the paper, and also, as in the Felician
 
version, offers the parents of the boy work on his crew. Though
 
in this case the final resolution is the same (a job for a deser-
ving poor boy is found), the Polish National version stresses
 
solidarity between people of relatively equal status as the means
 
for advancement (help given to a destitute man by an equaly poor
 
boy brings benefits for both), while the Felician sisters'  story
 
implies reliance on the benevolence of the rich. The Felician sis-
if
 
tars' version suggests that/the poor remain honest,  hard working,
 
and content, exhibiting the utmost of loyalty towards people of
 
higher social status, a miraculous change in their lives might
 
occure. The Polish National version of the story teaches mutual
 
help between people of the same class to bring about positive results
 
for all involved.
 
The pride in Polishness, that the textbook propagates,  is
 
always asserted in group terms. The Introduction to the Second
 
Reader ends with statement:
 
The more people we have who think in terms of absolute
 
Polishness,  the sooner we will cease to be the  '
dove race"
 
that always retracts into the shadows.
 
The assertiveness that is expressed in the reader often borders
 
on labor militancy, and these two aspects make these textbooks
 
quite distinct from any other Polish school books. A prose poem
 
for example,  depicts the depths of the depression in the following
 
words:
 
The End to UnemDloymen -t 
by Ada Negri
 
They looked at each other's faces. A destitute, pale crowd
 
With hunger and sleeplessness,  dumb with worry:
 
They are fed up with the struggle .
.. And then,  one of them
 
Speaks up,  timidly: When is the end?
 
And the second one: My children cry of hunger...
 
And the third one moanés. And through the chest
 
Of the people, a wind blew and a freezing shudder
 
But suddendly, with a spark in his eye, a young
 
Worker stands up: Never:
 
Lets -endure
. .
 to;the end,
 
Until Justice be done:  alive or dead:
 
We are Men,  too.
 
Second Reader, 193 4 , p.12
 
This poem depicts strikers as heroes who are determined
 
to fight for what they deem justice regardless of their desti-
tution. In a less dramatic
 
way,  a simple appreciation is shown
 
for-the work of a miner in
another selection from-this-
.-

for the work of a miner in another selection from this textbook
 
The Mine
  
jeep underground the miner works. He mines coal,  salt,  or'
 
ude iron. His work is very dangerous. The canal in which the
 
ners stand may collapse, for example, burrying the men who
 
re extracting the earth's treasures: there can be an explo-
sion of gasses or coal dust that burns hundreds of miners.
 
The work of a miner is very hard.
 Second Reader P.15
 
Another example of the  high relevance of the surroundings that
 
excerp t
 
cL
i
 
seems to prevail in these readings is an
; about a factory in
 
which the author hastens to point out that machines are not
 
enemies of workers and offers a solution to the labor problem
 
in the face of growing mechanization:
 
A great part of the work in a factory is done by machines,
 
which are serviced and controlled by men. As a result of
 
that, many people have lost their jobs. It is not that the
 
machine is necessarily an enemy of the worker, but,  for
 
a worker to have his job, hours have to be shortened so
 
that,  for the time the factory operates, more men must operate
 
machines.
 Second reader, p.
 
This solution certainly takes the workers' point of view.
 
One of the most explicit indictments of the industrial
 
system that appears in this books is a poem by Andrzej Niemojewski,
 
Starowina (Old Woman). The old woman hears that her son,  a steel-
worker, is a victim of an accident and comes on foot, days journey,
 
to the steel mill. She is told that he has broken his arms and legs
 
in this accident. When she arrives at the mill, which appears to
 
her as a '
real hell," she learns that her son, with several other
 
co-workers,  has just died after days of suffering.
 
This poem has both a social and a religious message.  One
 
of the points on which the Polish National Church disagreed
 
with the Roman Catholicism was the idea and the custom of threate-
ning people with the eternal fires of hell. Here the  poem
 
depicts the "real" hell--on earth and in industrial America.
 
It consists of inhuman working conditions and work relations,  and
 
is epitomized in the disregard for workers' lives.
 
The PNCC books are not filled with social criticism and
 
protest. In fact,  such readings are numerically much fewer than
 
those on the religious traditions,  the history of the church,
 
or misceleneous topics.  It is only important because it constitutes
 
a unique theme within all Polish language textbooks testifying to
 
the socially and class militancy at the origin of the schism.
 
It also helps us to understand some of the features of the "new
 
Poles' that the PNCC textbooks were hoping to educate.

Our School  
Today is Saturday but the school yard is busy and noisy. More
 
and more children are coming. Suntanned, happy, one can see that
 
they just came back from vacation. They talk constantly.
 
On the street a few
 passers-by stopped. They are observing the
 
children. One older lady asked two boys running by: What language
 
do these kids use?
 
-Polish- answered the younger one and kept running. But the older
 
boy politely stopped and explained:
 
-
 We are Poles. We come here to learn every Saturday.
 
-
 During the war I met many Poles-added to the conversation
 
gentelman standing near by.  -They are good men and brave soldiers.
 
And they love their country very much.
 
-And what do they teach you in this school?- he asked the boy.
 
-Our native tongue-he answered-and all that that you just said.
 
That the school teaches beside the language is als.:
 
the tradition of str gle for freedom and love of the country.
 
This reading is set in London's neighborhood : the comment
 
of the old gentleman could not be issued in the United States as
 
the image of Poles is very far from that expressed above.
 
How are these traditions and these sentiments taught?
 
Very characteristic is the story of a girl encountering her mother's
 
past memorabilia of which are kept in a special box
 the mother:
 
When Mommy opened the box, Amia saw on the top a white and
 
red band--it was old,  torn and stained.
 
-This is the treasure? -she asked disappointed?-What was this
 
band for?
 
7
 
Mother took her daughter on her lap.
 
-Long,  long time ago--she began to tell the story--when
 
you were not yet born,  there was a war, you heard of that.
 
The Germand occupied Warsaw. They were not good to the Poles.
 
Then the Warsawiand decided that M
1could not go on like that
 
1
-
1
 
any longer and resolved to thro
 the Germans out of Warsaw
 
by force. They rose to arms against the occupier. During the
 
uprising your mother was a soldier and this band was my
 
'
uniform.
 
'
I
 
Ania was surprised ag in.  The thought that a uniform consist id
 
of hit, pants,  jacket,  belt, and that only boys could become
 
soldiers. What she thought she said aloud.
 
-But, my dear, in Warsaw girls were also insurgents. And
 
there were no uniforms. A white and red band sufficed to
 
mean that you were a Polish soldier.
 
-Why didn't you wash your band, Mommy?
 
-When you grow a bit more,  I
']J:tell you history of each of
 
these stains. And the dust which covers this band is the dust
 
of the Warsaw streets.
 
*
 After the August 19'44 uprising,  300,000 such 'soldiers' and civilians
 
in Warsaw were dead and thousands of surviva s were taken to
 
concentration camps or forced labor p.&e
 inside of Germany.

In the books Polish holidays are discussed in terms of
 
the national celebrations that were observed before
 '

ThIs books represent a partIv the stubborn p siti n 
den

recognize  .  communist Poland so in these books poet-war Poland
 
is ignored.  In certain r

chose to concentrate on the frozen i
rr

with them leaving their homes in Poland. The image is full of quiant
 
straw-covered huts,  horse-pulled corn ortable sleds which used

The only time wh n Polad is actually mentioned is in one
 
story when a daughter goes to visit relatives in Poland. Her father
 
can't go with her (the allusion,to the political character of his
 
emigre status). When she comes back and greets her parents she
 
exclaimes ±katx±'Mommy, please, promise me that when we go back some-
day to Poland, we will settle in Wroclaw." Wroclaw is one of the
 
cities that Poland aquired after the WWLi. Another characteristic
 
phrase here is "going back" to Poland. Political emigre's program
 
had been to return to Poland and fight for freedom. So even a girt
 
9
 
born in England iQ talk
 
about "going back" to a place
 which
 
she haf never beei. This is the pattern of contradictory
 
statements,  so prevailing in this nost 4gic
 textbook / and
 
reminiscent of "remembering" the country one ha  never seen and
 
loving the native 1an uage which is not the language of the
 
country in Which one was born. Poles are extraordinarty crafty in
 
.

creating this sort of i11u sions of reality and  e

This series includes 2 basic textbooks for the beginning of Polish
 
Language course for English speaking children, with instruction
 
given in English and with Polish-English dictionaries. These books
 
Polska Mowa part I and II are accompanied by 2 booklets of teachers'
 
manuals. The series also includes one reader and 4 booklets of
 
I
 
Polish history. This series_
 and aspecially the Mowa Polska for beginners
 
are the first original textbooks written especially for children who
 
do not know any Polish. Most of these books were published as a
 
special contribution to the celebration of the 1000 years of Polish
 
statehood

The amount of specifically '
Polish' content is minimal;  the books
 
are obviously designed to teach the inguage and not the history and
 
Politics of Poland.  It offers,  however some popular songs (like

A characteristic for the American scenery is the insistance
 
of organizing ethnic festivals at certain, traditionally Polish
 
holidays. Not many Americans in Chicago are probably aware of the
 
fact that the Polish American)while celebrating

the communities,  churches and the press apA

celebrating May 3rd as the national holiday. In Polska Mowa  
Part II a short story depicts an American boy asking his Polish
 
12
 
friend about the meaning of the May 3rd parade. Then he asks whether
 
this holiday is also being celebrated in Poland. '4(O,' iS  the answer-
because it is a holiday of freedom.

the hostess waits on them serving them before every one else.

This essay traces the development of Polish curriculum

 For the sake of

on the  'old country,  (3)' the most diversified stage  (and  this
 
very diversification  indicates this stage has been reached)this/
 
occurs when  the group begins to perceive  itself as an  American
 
ethnic,  rather than Polish  immigrant,  group and  publishes
 
textbooks for  Americans of Polish  descent,  (4)  our  or esent
 
post-me t
ng  pot period which almost obliterated ethnic  languaqe
 
schools bu:  has also seen  revived  interest  in ethnicity since  the
 
1960s and  1970s,  when,  partially because of new,  post War
 
immigration,  new forms of ethnic education emerged.
 Replacin.:
 
the earlier  parish schol  which taught  in Polish,  we now have  a
 
/1
 
network of Saturday supplementary schoc
s.
 
:
)uring  the first stage,  the textbooks are  literally  brought
 
over  from  the old country and used  in America  to teach  immigranT:
 
children using contexts totally divorced from American  rea l-
J'
..
, 
and dependent  instead on the historical  and political
 
contingencies of the place  in which they originated.
 The  first
 
Polish  Americans used  textbooks written  under  the' cultur a '
 
autonomy  granted  by the Austro-Hungarian Empire to  the southern
 
pert of Poland called Galicia  in the second  part of  the
 
nineteenth  century.
 
The second stage was marked  by  the production of  textbook:
 
in  places  of  major Polish  settlement  in  America.  Tho'  ioro  not
 
yet D  ig  n  
books but compi. 1st ion  of ruad r
 t  cr  fro;
 
earlier,  Galician editions with minor additions an,:-, chsnoso,  rc
 
illustrati ons,  and some refererrce to the American context.
 The
 
C
 
most determining feature of these textbooks was that they were
 
not yet  produced for an ethnic American audience but for a socio..
 
group of  immigrants.
 This distinction  is most  important  in
 
analyzing  the content of these curriculum materials.

Before  describing  the  macor feature of  the  third stage one
 
has to understand that there are often contingencies aifectinc

-o f  the ethnic group  itself.
 For example the booming development
 
of Roman  Catholic Polish education  in the United States had a Ic
 
to do with  the decision taken  in  1882 by a conference of Bishops
 
called The Council of Baltimore to strongly recommend the
 
development of ethnic parishes and ethnic parish schools.
 The
 
reverse of this policy over a half century  later brought about
 
the end of the predomi
ance  in Polish American education of  the
 
Roman Catholic Church,  but  not,  however  the end of the Polish
 
education  in  America.  Polish education obviously served  vital
 
community  needs.
 It became channeled  into different niches
 
within the  communities.
 Similarly,  it  is not quite correct  to
 
assume that  the third stage was marked by the entire monopoly of

of Polish American schols.
 The third stage was marked by an

 proliferation of pub.icat

of  to ic

 These shared the preception that tho
 
group was a part of the American society rather than,  as  it hm

 The first Satudray school  textbooks wero

 Sc
 
however there was a need for books more specifically adress
ng
 
Polish children  in America and there began to appear textbooks
 
written  in the United States for children who would grow up to be
 
Americans with a knowledge of the  language and culture of Poland.
 
The very fact that these books were published was often dependent
 
on the general  mood of revived ethnic pride,  the availability of
 
social  support.
 They usually were produced due to the efforts
 
and generosity of  Individuals responsible for writing and

 Introduction
 
This reader in the second in the new series of textbooks....
 
in which we include so much material that it will fully sufice for the
 
use of our school. There will be no need for a fourth reader.
 
The novelty of this reader is the examples and description taken from
 
Polish history and arranged, as much as possible (why wouldn't it be?)
 
simple,
 
in chronologic order and said in such a way t
riat
 easily understandable for
 
children. We did not quote sizeable excerpts taken straight from history
 
because,fromour own experience  and in view of the advise given to us by
 
Teachers and Sisters ,
 we know that such excerpts are too difficult for not yet
 
well mentally developed children.

Reading excerpt no 36 ,
 pp 58- 2 Steel Pens presents a detailed description
 
of the process of production of steel pens, It begins with
, the old times
 
when goose pens when used by all those who knew
, and had the necessity to
 
write.
 
The steel pens have been in use only some 80 years by then and only in 1840a
 
they became common. The process of contemporary production begins with the
 
factory owner who brings thin sheets of tin to his factory and then his
,
 
workers, with specific assignments of tasks produce the product,
 
This is how' the story concludes:
 
p1-62
 
It is because the pens go through so many hands that are so inexpensive
 
now.  If we were to give such task to our (
,
In Poland) tinsmith worker, he
 
would need an entire day to produce one pen, and then it would probably be
 
less elegant and not as' good .  It would also have
, to cost an equivalent of
 
this worker's daily wage, that is about $2.
 
But instead,  (
here) each pen goes through the hands of many women and men worke
 
workers  each of whom performs but one task on them  (which enables the worker to
 
achieve the greatest proficiency and speed)
 using a specifically designed for
 
this task tool. So, in one day each worker handles thousands
, of pens  and
 
the factory, after paying the workers  and after spending money on the
 
maintenance of the factory buildings still makes a good profit while saling
 
few pens for a penny.

published for the use of Polish schools in America. Together with the
 
previous ones Pictural Primer (
Elementarz obrazkowy), the First and Second readers,
 
it contains everything that a Polish, child needs to know (

In arranging the readers we paid special attention to the most useful things
 
that a Polish child in America may need. Children will find many great examples
 
from Polish
, and American history. Also geography', geology, botany, physics
 
patriotic
 
and astronomy are included. In addition beautiful drawings
, great
 poems
 
and moral instructions  embraced in our stories and examples will make this
 
reader a desirable for every Polish child textbook

 In the introduction the editors
 
are stating that this series of books is designed to meet the new demands
 
of the Polish American community and its educational system. It hopes to  
replace the old textbooks that were just copied and re—arranged books from
 
the "old country", This book wants to speak to the Polish American child  and
 
offers information that are familiar to him and useful for his development.
 
Nevertheless the first readings are about the Guarding Angel, mice, cats, dog,
 
bird, doll, chicken ,  rooster, rabits, cows, horses. Then it comes "family home" and
 
this is American (
illustration)In the following story about "Grandparents"
 
we read" Grandma and Grandpa remember Poland well and often talk about it. We like
 
to hear about our dear fatherland"  Contains no Polish history, no patriotic poems
 
nor any actual information about America.

The banner
 
I love dearly  the flag of my country and I will always love it -
 a small
 
Jozio said to his Sister
 teacher.
 
-
 I am very glad about that, my child,- the Sister answered. Different
 
countries have different flags; America has its beautiful star
 
banner, that we have to always and everywhere defend.
 
All children exclaimed:
 
-
 Sister, when we grow up we will do anything for our country and its flag.
 
-
 That is beautiful to have such courageous and high-minded pupils in my
 
class. The American flag is one of the most beautiful.
 
But we have also another banner about which we cannot forget. Under

flag we also have to respect.
 
What kind of flag is that?
 
-Polish!- exclaimed the children.

A little child was walking down the street. He was
,
- poor, emaciated and was
 
covering his face with. his hands. A charitable lady noticed him and sent
 
him some bread. The maid runs hack to her saying:
 
"But -she says- my dear lady, this is a little Jew, and who heard of
 
giving charity to a Jew?"
 
kisxx
xkx The good lady found this remark outrageous,
 
"But he is poor- she answered-
- one has to help him,
 
Run back and take him a piece of bread.

. 275 free translation of a poem Do Dziecka Poiskiego (To a Polish Child)
 
What should I love, a child asks?
 
What is dear to my heart?
 
You should love God, because in the world
 
Nothing had happened without his hand.
 
You should love your father and mother
 
And pray for them every day,
 
Because they are always behind you
 
As a guard given to you by God.
 
To your Fatherland, after your family,
 
Arouse (
raise), the purest flame of passion:
 
o that its memore not be forgotten,
 
But always cherish, it in your heart.
 
L
n whose heart love florish
 
.
ather than corruption,
 
In his soul always radiates:
 
God, Family and Fatherland!

 eats and observations cm content:
 This is an anthology of 31 poets
 
and writers beginning with Mikolaj Rej  ,  Kochanowski, Skarga, the sentimentalists,
 
the great Romantics, through the Positivistic period of late 1
9th century to
  
contemporary writers .  Each writer has a biographical sketch with his/her major
 
literary development and a short excerpts from his/her works. The selections are
 
made to reflect the spirit of patriotism and to relate to the theme of exile;
 
both themes central to Polish literature as a whole but may aquire a special
  
meaning when read by students of Polish descent in Anierica.,The selection also
 
presents many social issues as discussed in Polish literature: poverty, peasants
 
lot etc. Relatively few poems and reading excerpts with religious content.
 
See translation of the Introduction.
 
(
Designed as an anthology for the
 
lower classes. Written in standard Polish ,  no explicit reference to Poles
 
abroad.

translation of the Readerts introduction
 
Encouragment for the propagation of the knowledge of Polish letters.  
We, Poles are rightly proud of our rich
- and great literature that takes
 
prominent place among Europe's best literatures. Many Polish writers
, are
 
translated into foreign languages (
i
Nickiewicz's works into 9 and  Sienkiewicz's
 
into nearly all civilized tongues). It is very sad that this rich and
 
Polis
 
beautiful heritage is entirely closed to
e of lower social standing
 
Only maybe a handful of Polish- craftsmen or peasants could tell you any-
thing about Kochanowski, Skarga, Krasicki, Mickiewicz, Slowacki, Krasinski,
 
Zaleski or Pol and other Polish writers whose worksin translation are enjoyed by
 
other nations while the Polish people (
for whom they were composed) remain
 
ignorant of them.  It is a sad and regretabie fact.
 
Knowledge, if fragmented, of our nation's great literature is needed by
 
the lower classes and is is especially needed by the youth. Lets learn
 
Polish literature. This knowledge awakes national consciousness, pride and
 
love of our Fatherland. We have to give all our strength to propagate Polish

.f observations on content:
 Contains 63 reading excerpts. introductior
 
states that the purpose of the book is to make the children aware of the plans and hopes
 
of the Polish National Church'
.
' Polish National Church has a right to do this not only in
 
view of its own "interest" but also in regard to the welfare of the whole Polish Nation."
 
It wants to create people who think in terms of "Polishness" and it hopes to have thus 
achieve a greater feeling of self worth among the Polish Americans. Introduces a "key" of
 
translated words and phrases that will make assimilation of the text easier for the children

Our School  
Today is Saturday but the school yard is busy and noisy. More
 
and more children are coming. Suntanned, happy,  one can see that
 
they just came back from vacation. They talk constantly.
 
On the street a few passers-by stopped. They are observinE the
 
children. One older lady asked two boys running by: What language
 
do these kids use?
 
-Polish- answered the younger one and kept running. But the older
 
boy politely stopped and explained:
 
-
 We are Poles. We come here to learn every Saturday.
 
-
 During the war I met many Poles-added to the conversation
 
gentelman standing near by. -They are good men and brave soldiers.
 
And they love their country very much.
 
-And what do they teach you in this school?- he asked the boy.
 
-Our native tongue-he answered-and all that that you just saic

Mo.ja Czytanka Textbook for 3rd grade.
 
London, 1979
 
The first three editions of Moja Czytanka were published in 15,000
 
copies each and were all out of print -
 it testifies, publisher's
 
note states- about the popularity of this useful book in the 30
 
countries of Polish settlement to which this book has been
 
distributed. The present edition, unchanged is also appearing
 
in 15,000 copies.
 
The book begins with a prayer for before and after classes.
 
Then follows a simple poem entitled:
 
Polish children in different countries
  
by J. Otwinowska
 
Stas urodzil sie w Kanadzie
 
A zbyszek w Londynie
 
Krzys we Francji, Basia w Niemczech,
 
Danka w Argentynie
 
p.7
 
Stas was born in Canada,
 
And Zbyszek in London
 
Krzys in France,  Basia in Germany
 
Danka in Argentina
 
And this Jas, whose daddy
 
T
as a Polish pilot
 
Lives now among black people
 
Somewhere near to equator.
 
All say th same prayer in
 
In their native language
 
Basia,  Danka, Stas, Krzys,  Zbyszek
 
And Jas,  the son of a pilot
 
In the book one can f
f
o1low the adventures and affaits of these
 
Polish children living around the world.
 
'
Toja Czytanka (3rd grade) 1979 London
 
Poland
 
The way Poland is described in this book ignores all the political
 
but also most of the social and cultural facts of contemporary Poland
 
Pictures of turn of the century straw covered huts have nothing to
 
do t
1ith contemporary village architecture.
 
Peasant jarmark does not look likeit is described in several
 
stories
 
best example is the illustration on page 21 depicting this imaginary
 
Polish village right on the outskirts of Krakow.
 
The only ieality that is respected is that Poland regained
 
the western territories. There is a story of a little girl
 
who went to visit relatives in Wroclaw (before the war Breslau)
 
the story ends with a symptomatic:
 
-
 Mommy,  little Ewa was saying hrgging her mother for welcom
 
-please promis me that when we go back someday to Poland, we will
 
settle in Wroclaw
 
"Going back to Poland- was the tradition ± of post-war emigre-,-
they were supposed to go back when the communist would make i
 
more livible there- or, in some cases when the communists would
 
be ousted.

Polish traditions: 
stories of national holidays-
in Poland between the war.  11th Novemebr, 3rd of May.
 
No mention of today's Poland and especially of its political system
 
On Nov. 1
,  according to Polish custom the children go to a cementary
 
in London to say prayers at a grave of a lady they knew who used to
 
be a soldier of Polish Home Army.
 
Mommy's uniform 
-
 a story about a box with treasures of the little
 
girl's mother.  The girl finally gets to see what is in the box:
 
When Mommy opened the box,  Ania saw on the top a white and red
 
band.  It was an old band,  torn and stained.
 
-This is the tresure? -
 she asked surprised-What is this band for?
 
Mommy took her daughter on her lap.
 
-Long, long time ago- she began to tell the story--when you
 
werent even born,  there was, a war, you heard of that. The Germans
 
occupied Warsaw.  They were not good to Poles. Then the Warsawians
 
decided that it could not go on like that any longer and resolved
 
to through the Germans out with forge. They rose to arms against
 
the occupier.  During this uprising your mother was a soldier. And
 
this band was my uniform.
 
Ania was surprised again. She thought that a uniform consisted of
 
hut, pants,  jacket, belt,  and that obly boys could be a soldier.
 
What she thought she said aloud.
 
-
 But my dear,  in Warsaw girls were also insurgents. And there
 
were no other uniforms. A white and red band sufficed to mean that
 
you were a Polish soldier.
 
-
 Why didn't you wash this your uniform,
 ommy?
 
-
 When you grow a bit more,  I
'l tell you history of each of
 
these stains. And dust which covered this band was the dust of
 
the Warsaw streets.

The Chicago series
  
This series includes 2 basic textbooks for the beginning of Polish
 
Language course for English speaking children, with instruction
 
given in English and with Polish-English dictionaries. These books
 
Polska Mowa part I and II are accompanied by 2 booklets of teachers'
 
manuals. The series also includes one reader and 4 booklets of
 
Polish history.  This series and aspecially the Mowa Polska for beginners
 
are the first original textbooks written especially for children who
 
do not know any Polish. Most of these books were published as a
 
special contribution to the celebration of the 1000 years of Polish
 
statehood that was celebrated in 1966.
 
The first textbooks of Polish for foreign language students
 
are original and very good. They present realities of local (often
 
Chicago) life,  have not much of political line and are very methodical.
 
They are designed for students who already can write and read in
 
English. The readers and history books are much less accopplished in
 
this respect. All in Polish,  they often lack cohesiveness being a
 
more or less arbitrary compilation of stories,  legends and political
 
and/or sentimental "
example" of moral behavior stories. Though
 
military tradition is not as stressed (if at all in the first books)
 
their allusions are decisively anti-communist.axA

themes from the Polish history from late 18th century to World War II
 
Special emphasis on Polish struggle for freedom, military tradittions 
The main themes are: Towards freedom(12 stories) Fameous Poles in the
 
World and in Poland(13 including Chopin, Marie Curie, Paderewskibut not
 
pulaici)  courageous and Enduring (mostly about the defense of Polish

.
 
to kusslan,  and German) in the Resurrected Polad ,

political diaspora. No overt anti-communist allusions.
 
One of the "school stories" treats about the 1905 school strike
 
that led to the opening of Polish schools in the Russian occupied Poland,
 
another describes the struggle that Polish children endured under the
 
German occupation.

orchestras playing happy melodies.
 
at the end the American boy asks:
 
"Janek, is this holiday also observed in Poland? as national Holiday?
 
asks Jim.
 
-No, my dear- answers Janek with sadness. They don 't celebrate the 3rd
 
of May now.

ontent: Textbook for children who do not
 
know any Polish, but do write and read English. All instruction is
 
in English, dictionary at the end and vocabulary after each 1es on
 
it is designed for children but -as the editors state in the methodologica
 
supplement to this book, it has been widely used for teaching sdiilts.
 
W
lie reading excrp-ts are short and th e boo k has  an  appearance of a standard
 
foreign laguage textbook. There is very little of Polish content.  There
 
are few songs such as  '
loo lat" (Hundred years- a song sun  for birthdays
 
etc) with musical nota ti ons  for  it. Pulaski Street is mentioned and in
 
CL  Luiiv isa1jurj after the
 reet  reading p.89,
 it is said that he was
 
a great Pole. The buses (p.85) are green and busfare costs 250 foradult
 
and 150 for child.  i would use this book to teach my daughter.

n  observations on c
ontent:  Basically a continuation of
 
Polish Language Part I
. The reading excerpts are longer. There is
 
also a section (134- 150) of Grammar in which Noun,  Ajective, Pronoun 
adverb and vei T
h is discussed with inflection and examples. Though today's
 
Poland is still basically absent from the texts,  there is some covrt 
allusions to tf
le oppressive character of its political system.  In this
 
reader, while discussing the May 3rd parade in Chicago(the plots of
 
most of the stories take place there) an American boy asks whether
 
this Io1id.y j now observed in 
land- It is no -u
- arid that is because

The son concludes that he will
 
fight for freedom of Poland "because Poland must be free again."
 
As a textbook for English spea INc CHILDREN  very good.

it varies in that unlike in the first one, this one is designed to

and conjugate nouns, verbs,  adjectives etc. and know different
 
aspects and moods.
 Manual for this part again is divided into

Ukochany Kraj Chicago 1981
 
The textbook in the introduction announces that it is experimental
 
in that it is new and includes lots of local color,  local history
 
ftc. Not so much of it
 is present (Into by Helena Ziolkowska)
 
in fact. One story (p.47 )
 however describes the May 3rd celebration
 
in Chicago. After explaining the meaning of the holiday "It was
 
long time ago. Wise men wanted that all be well in Poland. and noone
 
suffer injustice. They resolved to have new laws, better than the
 
old ones. They discussed it for 4 years and finally issued them.
 
These new laws were called Constitution. It was announced on May 3
 
1791. To commemorate it, Poles celebrate the 3rd of May as the
 
Holiday of the Constitution of May 3
. "
 So it goes somehow simplified
 
-to say the least- version of historical background.
 
Then the "plot" turnes to Chicago:
 
"Polish Chicago celebrates the Third of May with pomp. On the
 
first Saturday of May there is a parade organized by the Polish
 
National Alliance. Everybody comes for the parade: adults, youth,
 
children. In the parade march school children with small flaga /
 
and flowers in their hands,  scouts,
 veterans of different wars,
 
police, representatives of different organizations, military bands
 
t
i
c
 
folk bands. There ride colorful chario-ts(? rydwany in Polish)
 
folg groups dance and you can see everywhere polish and American
 
flags.
 
On the first Sunday in May always a special mass is said in Holy
 
Trinity chirch. This mass is attended by scores of adults and youth.

This is a standard and comprehensive grammar of the Polish language. In the 
introduction the nature and function of spoken and written language are
 
presented, morphology, phonology and syntax. In the last part of the intro.
 
the author states that this grammar departs from previously used grammars
 
in America
 (I.e. Grammar by Malecki and by Konarski)
 Spelling is according
 
to the recent rulings of the Polish Academy .
 But sincp the grammar is intended
 
for instructions of Polish American youth, that knows better English termino-
logy of grammar, then Polish ,
 a translations of such have been provided.
 
In fact there are but few translations in (
) in the text.

7 short reading excerpts include a prayer, a songs(fo1k song of Cracow region)
 
fables, puzzles ,  a story about peasant boys (
parobek) asking the teacher
 
how can he know about countries in which people are black and sea travel if
 
he had never been there. A short reading entitles Poland reads:
  
Poland, our fatherland was once a big and powerful ki -i
gdom. Polish king had
 
more land then many emperors. One who wanted to get from one end of Poland to
 
the other (
from sea to sea) would have to walk 2 months. Polish monarchs were
 
so powerful that they ordered other kings
 
Then many disasters came upon our country and the Polish nation lost its strength.
 
Neighboring monarchs invaded Poland and partitioned it between themselves.

content
 
Cther  o ients and observations on content:
 
"for the use of English speaking people a handy means of putting themselves in communicati
 
with their Polish fellow citizens. With the help of this manual the author hopes it will
 
possible to issue necessary instructions to workmen, servants etc., and also to carry on
 
buying and selling transactions, and also to carry on simple conversations on such matters
 
as health, time, weather, war etc.  "
 (
praface)
 
The book uses a phonetic method and gives whole sentences transliterated
 
It includes fluency excercizes that seems impossible to folJow much less to learn by
 
heart, as the author suggests. This book is interesting in that it depicts the
 
social standing of the Polish community -
 at least in its author's estimation.
 
The readings follow from the Immigration office, post  office renting rooms to
 
"engaging a servant, washwoman, looking for work, machinist, carpenter, mining, railroad
 
the day laborer, the farm hand.
