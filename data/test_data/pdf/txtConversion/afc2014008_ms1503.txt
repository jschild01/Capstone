Discussed assignment sheet and readings.
 
General  discussion on format and problems  to be con-
sidered in our discussion of folkmusic.
 
Purpose in dealing with children's material first
 
1.
 We all  share the common experience of having once been
 
a child.
 
2.
 Breaks down barriers one has that folkmusic is  something
 
others do someplace other than where we are.
 
Instruments and vocal  style
 
1.
 Essentials of style are learned -
 culture given -
 so that
 
by the age of 3 or 4 we can distinguish children of
 
different cultures by this style.
 
American folksong repertoire -
 historically and functionally
 
1.
 Double phenomenon of product  (song)  and function of that
 
product.
 
Song -
 What are the qualities of a folksong?
 
1.
 Definitional boundries  are difficult.
 
2.
 A folksong is constructed and defined by a folk commu-
nity -
 as  a folksong -
 according to recognizable structural
 
patterns
 
3.
 We can recognize these structural patterns to make dis-
tinctions within the way a song is put together,  i.e.,
 
recognizable folk quality.

 Folk  style refers  to construction and performance of
 
a song in a manner that is  comfortable to a folk  group.
 
1.
 Definition of folk  group -
 a group held together by one
 
or more elements held in common,  e.g.,  occupation,  resi-
dence,  economics  (similar to  subgroup in sociology).
 
a.
 Some groups  share more cultural identity than others
 
(shared tradition)
 
b.
 Isolation,  especially geographic,  creates  the  set-
ting for a strongly shared tradition.
 There are
 
other kinds of isolation however.
 
Characteristics of Folksong
  
1.
 Not officially taught -
 transmitted via word of mouth,
 
learned orally rather than literally.
 Music is  intrin-
sically absorbed by ear.
 People still would rather hear
 
a symphony than read it.
 
2.
 Variation in performance -
 versions and variants  are
 
intrinsic to the nature of folksong.
 
a.
 No standard against which each performance is  evalua-
ted.
 No one way is  the best way.
 
b.
 The statement  "no  standard version" is  an academic
 
statement.
 The singer will  say "My way is  standard,"
 
but no other singer will  agree with him.
 
C.
 A folksong is in the possession of and is  the property
 
of the singer or group.
 It is their own thing.
 
d.
 Possession and variation are crucial  elements.
 
3.
 Anonymous -
 if not in terms of origin,  at  least in the
 
way people feel  about it.
 The song no longer belongs  to
 
the writer but in a sense it has become  "my song."
 What
 
people are actually saying is  that  "I  think  enough of this
 
song that I want to claim it as my own."
 
4.
 A song can be a folksong in one context and not a folk-
song in another context.
 
5.
 Folksongs have lives or life histories. 
Sam Hinton says
 
that we can know a few things  about a song at first  glance
 
but to know it better we have to know its history.
 
Distinction between £olksinger and  singer of folksongs.
 
a.
 Folksinger -
 belongs  to  a specific folk community
 
he is  singing from his own first-hand tradition.
 He
 
is not trying to appeal  to all  groups  at all  times,
 
therefore limited.
 Key point.
 Primary tradition
 
clearer and more  stable.
 An easier cultural  state-
ment to understand.
 
b.
 Singer of folksongs -
 secondary tradition.
 
C.
 Not a question of an evaluative  statement  as to which
 
is real or not real,  good or bad,  right or wrong.
 
The difference between a folksinger and a singer of
 
folksongs is  qualitative.

To illustrate the different types of problems  to be
 
confronted in study of folklore and folkmusic we will  study
 
one folk  group rather than a repertoire.
 The folk  group will
 
be the child.
 The child has  two  sources of information
 
1.
 The body of material  learned from adults
 
2.
 The body of material  learned from other children
 
These two areas are distinctly separated with almost no over-
lap -
 mutually exclusive.
 With the possible exception of the
 
summer camp experience.
 
First area to be examined -
 lullaby tradition.
 The
 
lullaby tradition is eclectic -
 that is  to say from many
 
sources.
 
Two stages to lullaby singing
  
1.
 To establish emotional  and social  contact and to amuse the
 
child -
 non-functional
 
2.
 Getting down to the business of putting child to  sleep -  
functional
 
a.
 Separates day from night -
 indicating period of
 
"coming down" or relaxation.
 
Factors  involved:
 
1.
 Musical  and verbal with the distinction resting in the
 
rhythm (sophoriphic -
 sleep inducing)
 
2.
 Communication factors
 
a.
 Rhythm rather than message content
 
b.
 Verbal  factors are not the only ones at work
 
Selection preference
  
1.
 Children base preference on musical  rather than verbal
 
factors
 
2.
 Parent makes the initial  selection rather than the baby.
 
We can tell more about  the mother than the baby because
 
she is  singing songs  she feels most comfortable with.
 
Folk taxonomy -
 categorization of materials
 
What we think of,  objectively,  as a lullaby we may not
 
include in our repertoire of functional lullabys.
 
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS
 
1.
 Bessie Jones -
 "Go to Sleepy Little Baby" or "All  the
 
Pretty Little Horses"
 
Negro in origin -
 developed either during slavery or else re-
flective of it.
 Most popular lullaby throughout the  south on
 
both sides of the color line.
 
Lullaby Content

 Children coming to  some harm
 
Conclusions and observations on the lullaby
 
i.
 On the subject of separation
  
a.
 Theme is fairly consistent
 
b.
 Parents  go away but may return
 
*c.
 In terms of actual physical  separation there is a
 
real crisis for the mother.
 The child now exists
 
outside her body.
 The lullaby reflects this and of-
fers an expression to the sentiment.
 
d.
 A more obvious observation is that the lullaby re-
flects parent's objection to child's presence.
 
Sublimation of aggression.
 This only a small part
 
of the interpretation.
 
2.
 On the subject of fear and harm
  
a.
 Appealing to children because of their love of
 
delicious fear and vague terrors
 
b.
 There are dangers but we'll  sing about them under the
 
safest securist conditions -
 Mama's lap.
 
C.
 Perhaps there is a pitting of fear and danger against
 
the hoped for or expected omnipotence and omnipres-
ence of mama for purposes of testing and reinforcing
 
secure relationship between child and parent--B.L.
 
d.
 Fantasy is personalized and dealt with.
 It is much
 
better to deal with things in fantasy rather than
 
realistic terms.
 Total  fantasy is an easier distinc-
tion for the child to make than partial fantasy,
 
e.g.,  story of mama shooting the monster  seen by her
 
child in the bedroom rather than tell the child it
 
doesn't exist.

General discussion of musical experience and what it
 
means to the child.
 
1.
 Children are people and they are communicating a message
 
so when an adult says  "I don't like their music" he is
 
really saying,  "Their message doesn' t mean anything to
 
me."
 They are not being sensitive to cultural  confronta-
tion.
 They don't understand the message that is being
 
transmitted.
 
2.
 The message is different because the problems are differ-
ent.

Music is a part of life -
 functional  and non-functional.
 
It's functional for the people who create it.
 We can't al-
ways look a
L it from our own point of view of being entertained
 
or amused.
 Not all music is background music.
 Functionally
 
speaking it occupies  the entire communication space,  e.g.,
 
Guthrie and his western ballads.
 The musical experience has
 
something to communicate other than verbal  content.
 Look at
 
it in its context:  How is it done,  where,  why,  under what
 
circumstances?
 
Recommended audio material  for children ages  approximately
 
2-7,  "Songs to Grow on," Woody Guthrie,  Folkways
 
Where does child learn musical experience?
 
1.
 Not inborn or innate
 
2.
 Music is either learned or not learned depending on en-
couragement of society
 
3.
 Voice quality culturally determined rather than physio-
logically determined.
 
4.
 The experience is not confined only to lullabys.
 
5.
 Enormous variety of intake from all  sources of  exposure
 
a.
 There are songs  that are designated as  children's
 
songs.
 This area is mutually agreed upon by both
 
child and adult
 
1)  animal  song
 
2)  proper behavior
 
3)  learning songs
 
b.
 These categories are functional.
 They are adult in
 
origin but set aside for children because their func-
tion is no longer critical  for the adult.
 
Social  attitudes toward the musical experience  
Music is considered as a highly specialized activity
 
where creativity is  limited and controlled.
 The actual ex-
perience itself is involved with the vital  apparatus with
 
which we eat and breathe.
 The idea that music is a specia-
list activity is reinforced by our post-literate society.
 
There are few roles for the non-expert.
 We are constantly
 
trying to compete with the standards  society sets up.
 "Any-
thing worth doing is worth doing well."
 Just  "how well" is
 
well?

Adults assume that the only music children know is
 
"children's music."
 This is not so.
 Their entire cultural
 
experience in terms of all  that they hear is part of their
 
repertoire.

Statements on musical  attitudes  from adult and child perspec-
tives  
Child goes  to school  and learns that what he has known
 
previously and learned previously to be music is not music
 
at all.
 The reason that he is  given is  that he didn' t learn
 
it at school,  i.e.,  the only music is  school music and the
 
child must abandon his  already acquired musical  culture.
 No
 
carry-over between experience  at home and school experience
 
is permitted.
 Adults  should recognize that the child has  al-
ready established his musical  culture.
 
Reference cited:  Ruth Benedict -
 article on discontinuity
 
As  stated before,  the child and adult are mutually agree-
able on what songs  are for children exclusively.
 They have
 
met on a high intellectual  level  on mutually acceptable ma-
terial.
 
1.
 Any song about an animal -
 any animal  any song
 
ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL
 
Almeda Riddle  (Ozarks,  independent,  sharp tongued in control
 
of herself,  experienced mother and grandmother)
 
a.
 Animals doing horrendous  acts may be substitutions
 
for people.

Story of QuartSie and his untimely and grotesque meeting with
 
his maker
 
1)  Nick used the song form to express or say his
 
thoughts  about events past.
 He used framework
 
and perspective and his own repertoire
 
b.
 Point is  that children think of them as  "dead"  songs
 
and adults think of them as animal  songs.
 Neither
 
the child nor the adult knows what the other one is.
 
A child doesn' t know what death is and an adult
 
doesn' t know what an animal is.

initially a satire based on English and French relations be-
tween Queen Elizabeth and

There are,  in the folk repertoire,  songs composed by
 
adults specifically for children.
 It is  a recent 20th cen-
tury phenomenon to consider children as some special  entity
 
unto themselves.
 
Types of recent cor
ners to the repertoire
  
1.
 Educational learning song -
 used overtly in school in
 
the beginning mainly because of the lack of print.
 Memo-
rization by rote and repetition.
 
a.
 Still  strong with country people in acquiring proper
 
conduct.
 
2.
 Cautionary song -
 piece of evidence that reinforces idea
 
that these songs were written recently for children is
 
the overt moral at the end of the song.
 Cautionary song
 
carries the message that if you absorb the moral you
 
won't be confronted with the problem against which the
 
song warns.
 
To discover community attitudes,  we should not only
 
examine the overt message of the cautionary song but also
 
the covert,  subtle actions that people are really doing.
 
Significance of repertoire -
 it illustrates what a folk
 
group wants to talk about and function with.
 
Repertoire transmitted via child to child -
 it's not until
 
approximately the elementary school age that the child de-
velops his group tendency.
 At the nursery school  age,  they
 
are still rather individually oriented.

Active Tradition
  
1.
 Reinventing,  reworking with enormous  amount of variation.
 
2.
 Parody is  in its prime
 
3.
 Extremely fast  transmission -
 jumps  space extremely
 
rapidly
 
a.
 Form,  tune,  structure along with limited new items
 
aids the speed
 
4.
 Stability -
 in its essence very old.
 Some of it is the
 
oldest that we have to work with.
 
The Reason:
 
a.
 Kids are conservative -
 they are trandition conscious
 
b.
 They like repetition
 
C.
 They are always  trying to bring order out of chaos
 
d.
 In general,  the child's  life is less  affected by
 
change than the adult's
 
e.
 In country areas particularly,  a child learns his
 
tradition from adults,  ergo contains oldest elements.
 
Action Songs (Rhymes,  chants  etc.  that involve physical  action,
 
e.g.,  Jump rope,  ball bouncing)
 
1.
 Beautifully constructed for  their purpose:  to do the

In the general  area of  the skill  game,  e.g.,  marbles,
 
jump rope,  jacks,  the child is involved with some kind of
 
independent testing of himself.
 Each child is  "doing his
 
own thing"  (yes Bess,  you said it)  in concert with other
 
players present.

Construction
  
1.
 Almost all of the skill  games  are constructed in like
 
fashion
 
a.
 Sequential  gradation of difficulty for purposes of
 
perfecting his own ability  (competition is in terms
 
of raising personal  skill  level).
 The child is not
 
involved with interacting
 
2.
 These games occupy an enormous amount of the child's time.
 
Therefore,  the amount of  satisfaction must be critical
 
for him that he  should persist in his  tradition in face
 
of the opportunities and enticements of the affluent
 
society in which he lives.
 
Culture pattern at work  
1.
 Patterns don't move rapidly
 
2.
 Tend to be highly conservative
 
3.
 Modifications over long periods of time
 
a.
 Patterns  cannot be changed by making a law or a rule.
 
Human behavior cannot be regulated in such a manner.
 
Cannot control  significant cultural behavior in any
 
fundamental  sense,  e.g.,  "Carnival" on the Islands
 
or Irish patriotic songs vs.  British
 
Mrs.  Hawes pauses  a moment  to reflect on the question of in-
creasing difficulty concerning the structure  (simple to com-
plex)  of games.
 Is it natural,  she asks?
 I don't know is
 
the answer.
 In the same pensive mood she poses  these ques-
tions  .
 .
 .
 What  is it when we decide to  go into the world
 
of play?
 What  do we give up and what new restrictions do we
 
accept?
 Why?
 
Through the skill  game there is  the attempt to develop
 
musical  tradition.
 Preference factors are extremely evident
 
in many of the skill  games.
 The best example being the jump
 
rope rhyme.
 There must be something attractive in them that
 
makes  jumping rope to  some rhymes preferable to jumping rope
 
to others.
 Some are more meaningful  and important than
 
others.
 
B.H.  Has to do with rhythmic structure,  tonal,  melodic
 
factors.
 Maybe even vowel  preference.
 All  the aforemen-
tioned are possibilities  for  some rhymes  achieving such in-
credible popularity,  e.g.,
 
Down by the Ocean
 Not last night
 
Down by the Sea
 But  the night before
 
Johnny broke a bottle
 24 robbers  came
 
and he blamed it on me
 knocking at my door

We connect  song with physical movements from early on.
 
Not necessarily dance but the sensation that something ought
 
to be going on with the song is picked up at a very early
 
age
 
Categories  
1.
 Songs that can be compressed or expanded
 
"time filling"  -
 e.g.,  "99 bottles of beer??
 
"circular songs" -
 d.g.,  "Hole in the bucket"
 
a.
 20th century child has a great deal of time on his
 
hands.
 From the child's point of view,  time is random
 
and uncontrollable.
 Therefore,  he sings these ex-
pandable or contractable songs to fill  the time.
 
b.
 Important for child to sing these songs to impose
 
order and attempt to control vagueries of infinity.
 
It's probably just as important to know also that
 
grown-ups can't stand the song.
 
2.  Name songs.
 Knowing the name of something is of enormous
 
importance.
 Kind of magical  quality giving you power over
 
someone if you possess the knowledge of his name.
 
3.
 "Funny"  songs -
 or in adult terms "naughty"
 
a.
 Excretion and other bathroom functions
 
b.
 From Freudian point of view we are dealing with a
 
magical  symbolic substance
 
1)  parts of our body have a highly personalized
 
value to us.
 Strong sense of possessiveness
 
about our bodies,  its extensions and its functions.
 
In the non-literate sense -
 if someone gets a
 
hold of a piece of us,  it gives him power over
 
US.
 So we develop a very tight  (perhaps  "uptight")
 
or intimate relationship with our bodies.
 
2)  Since a child can't keep his excretion,  he makes
 
up songs about it to keep in intimate contact and
 
control over those things that are near,  dear,
 
and vital  to him  (BLf
l).

General  Discussion of Obscenity
  
Our class is not a music or an art class.
 It is a
  
Social  Science. 
Dedicated to  the pursuit of what is -
 not
 
what ought to be.
 We examine the relationship between the
 
art of music and the life in which it functions.
 It is
 
not for the social  scientist  to censor.
 We should observe
 
what exists and analyze  the implications.

different  than promulgating the  contents of the observation.
 
Obscenity is related to  taboo in any society.
 However,
 
every society defines obscenity differently.
 Obscenity is
 
what is -
 it is oral  tradition -
 it is what we  say.
 We
 
don't write it.
 In fact,  we' ve  got some type of opposition
 
to writing obscenity.
 (Its obscene),  i.e.,  force of orality
 
as opposed to  force of writing in our  society.
 
Folklore is  a reflection of what people are thinking.
 And
 
what we are thinking is not  all  the good and the beautiful.
 
The hang-ups are to be reflected in a group's  folklore.
 A
 
group expresses all  points of view which may or may not be
 
repugnant to the observer.

 2 ways  to  look  at them
  
1.
 Investigating their own limits of power vis  a vis  the
 
power structure around them.
 Speak  the unspeakable.
 
What are the limits of what you can say and to whom you
 
can say it?
 A child  (or an adult)  can say shocking
 
things in an accepted form and depersonalize the message
 
content.
 Responsibility rests with the song,  not indi-
vidual  (major function of oral  tradition).
 
2.
 Child vs.  adult world -
 anti-authority in general.
 
Anti-teacher and anti-parent,  anti-patriotic,  e. g.,
 
parodies of pledge of allegience and  "My Country  'Tis
 
of Thee."
 
a.
 Typical  child parody form is exact reversal  and it
 
may be indicative of the non-literate concepts  of
 
reversal  magic.
 
The fact that the child creates  a song or parody,  or
 
the act itself is an act of protest.
 He has  to want  to  do
 
pretty badly to take the time to restate it.

2.
 Accurate statement of a situation all of us have known -
 
particularly a routine for a 4 year old.
 
3.
 The boy comes from a too highly specialized and sophis-
ticated background,  ergo unlikely that other 4 year olds
 
would take it into their own personal repertoire.
 At the
 
age of 4,  children don't have a sense of group identity
 
so it probably wouldn't be taken up by them.
 
a.
 Partly because of the tune.
 The verse is in such
 
a free form that it takes a highly sophisticated
 
musician to write the tune.
 
In contrast
  
B.
 Parody -
 "On Top of Old Smokey"  (Red Rubber Band)
 
1.
 Sincere but not skillful.
 
2.
 Took an existing song from which to work with,  built in
 
rhythm lines,  etc.
 Provides  the parameters within which
 
to construct a protest
 
3.
 The child is put into the song almost too personally to
 
"make it" in the tradition;  as opposed to Glory Halelujah
 
which is not personal  at all.
 
4.
 Too personal to make it.
 He is  saying "I hate so and so
 
and I' d like to do such and such."
 Needs to be deper-
sonalized.
 Tell  a story about "someone else."
 B.H.
 
a.
 Purpose of the song is to move what you want to say
 
away from you,  to shield you from emotional  conse-
quences of what you are saying,  i.e.  a folksong and
 
Bess's idea as  to what is  a folksong (other prin-
ciples have been stated in more detailed form in a
 
previous lecture).
 
Singing Game
  
1.  An active tradition in rural minority  (non-English speak-
ing also)  areas.
 This tradition does not involve only
 
games learned in school.
 
2.
 Different from skill  game.
 Interaction with others is
 
an intrinsic part of a major distinction between singing
 
games and skill  games.
 
3.
 Most of the tradition came from Great Britain.
 Descend-
ants of the children that first came over to America no
 
longer play these games but others do -
 particularly in
 
rural areas.

The singing game has  survived in minority and ethnic
 
groups.
 To what extent with all  groups?
 Don't know.
 
1.
 Black children are enlarging on and making more complex
 
the tradition.
 They probably picked up from white tra-
dition 100 years or so ago.
 
2.
 The games are picked up around the 3rd grade and perfected
 
until  the 6th grade and abandoned at  7th grade or junior
 
high.
 
3.
 Both boys and girls know them, but only girls play them.
 
Boys will play them but not in public and only as a fill
 
in.
 
Game is formalized behavior -
 sort of larger than life.
 
Makes  explicit,  if you can read the code,  certain types of
 
behavior.
 
1.
 These games will  survive without any encouragement from
 
the school.
 
2.
 They exhibit mutual  concernand cooperation.
 The children
 
are moving together because they want to not because
 
someone is telling them to  "get themselves together."
 
3.
 Social interaction and accomodation is built into  the
 
structure
 
WORDS OF WISDOM TO WOULD BE EDUCATORS:
 
Look at the circumstances under which children are cooperating
 
(e.g.,  singing game)  and try to make it operational  in the
 
classroom.
 
Bess  showed film of Negro children's  games.
 The class
 
(basically white middle class)  did not relate as actively or
 
with as much enthusiasm as did the audience composed of
 
minority students that  saw the film in the summer of  '68
 
on Project Learn  (EOP).
 It indicates,  to me,  the enormous
 
force of cultural identification operating within the black
 
students and the inability of the white students to pick up
 
clues of another tradition at work.
 How will  the white man
 
narrow the gap in terms of responding to and the understanding
 
of a culture and life-style different from his own? (EL)

zation of games.
 
more stress  on everyone  get -
a.
 Almost no  competition -
 
ting their turn.
 "I' ve had too many turns."
 
b.
 Game activity is  such that everyone gets a turn.
 The
 
games  are a socially agreed upon device to provide
 
everyone a turn regardless of their being good or bad.
 
1)  This is reflected in early Dixieland Jazz.
 Solo
 
performance with the other instruments in a suppor-
tive role to make the  soloist  sound better or the
 
best he could possibly sound.
 Solo and  suppor-
tive roles alternate to  give everyone a chance to
 
"do their own thing."
 
2)  Another example comes  from Guy Carowan in a Negro
 
church in the South.
 The congregation was involved
 
in telling their experiences.
 An individual  talks
 
and the congregation supports with "Yes Sir,  Lord"
 
etc.
 A tongue tied guy got up a spoke inco-
herently,  yet  still he receives  the
 
tive response from the congregation.
 
Girls traditionally play patterened games.
 -
 
tionally play less patterned or non-patterned games.
 This
 
is reflective of  the roles  that  they will be encouraged to
 
assume later on in life.
 Boys  are encouraged to be  aggres-
sive and function well  in the "jungle."
 Girls are to provide
 
the stability and structure of a family.
 So what we have is
 
a dramatization of basic methods of  social organization in
 
these  games.
 Culture patterns  either fit,  are made to fit,
 
or are forgotten.
 
The singing game in American  society has bridged the g
 
between the child and the adult.
 To support this  concept,
 
let us  consider the importance of theAmerican Puritan etho

a.
 Along with this developed the idea that life on earth
 
was a preparation period for proper reward upon death.
 
All of these attitudes were common in the Old World too
 
but intensified here in America because of geographic  isola-
tion and unfamiliarity with the land and its inhabitants.
 
This tension became focused in the religious practices.
 
Secular  (Non-religious)  activity as opposed to Sacred
 
(religious)  became identified with sin.

 No carnal pleasure -
 not only on a sexual  level but

sinful.
 
The religious leaders began to  zero in on particular ac-
tivities.
 Some were wicked and others were not.
 It was OK
 
to sing a song but only a religious one.
 It was a sin to
 
dance unless,  of course,  it was  a religious dance.
 In the
 
South in particular any form of dance was devil's activity
 
and you were bound for hell  as  sure as shooting.

 Listen for traditional musical  systems as well as tradi-

Prejudice against instrumentation developed all over the
 
country but peaked in the South.
 In the folk opinion,  the
 
world was divided into  2 sectors
 
1.
 Sacred
 
2.
 Secular
 
Therefore,  if you believed in this division,  the decision to
 
be a guitar picker and pick the blues is a radical one and
 
alienating from the community.
 The playing of any instrument,
 
especially the fiddle  (then banjo,  then guitar)  was considered
 
devil's  activity  (this belief is European in origin).

Human beings have developed many instruments and at the
 
same time they have developed preferences.
 Certain cultures
 
like certain types of instruments.
 
1.
 U.S.  likes to pluck or hit strings to agitate a sound.
 
2.
 Africa -
 beats on drum skins  and wood.
 
3.
 Indonesia -
 bangs on metal  (material on Indonesia is
 
scarce).

Auditory possibilities of the human ear help develop a
 
musical  system.
 There is  a range in which the human ear
 
doesn't receive sound,  i.e.,  and infinite range of possible
 
pitches.
 
When cultures determine whether or not a sound is music
 
or noise,  they depend heavily on the concept of pitch,  ergo
 
none of us are tone deaf.
 In our speaking voice,  we develop
 
finer gradation of pitch than necessary for singing.
 
Musical
 System  (vocal music)  is  extension of speech system.

these qualities.

One would think that preferences would be related to

 Not true,

Indonesia.
 
Instruments  are all  extensions of the human body.

Percussion systems  should be thought of in terms of:
 
1.
 How hard do you hit it
 
2.
 Pitch
 
3.
 Rhythm
 
Body music,  in this country,  is an Afro-american tradi-
tion due to the concept of percussive qualities of the afore
 
mentioned items.
 
When brought to U.S.,  the Africans were not allowed their
 
dramas for 2 reasons:
 
1.
 They were related to religion and ritual  and the slave
 
owner was intent on converting his  slaves  to Protestantism.
 
2.
 Drums were a means of communication and the slave owners
 
did not want that.
 
The tonal language of drums  communicates what is  said through
 
rhythm and pitch.
 Pitch is a change in preferent meaning.
 In
 
a tonal  language,  word meaning is  changed by a change in
 
pitch.
 
REMEMBER:
 A black child playing body music is not think-
ing of the tribal patterns of Africa 300 years  ago.
 He is
 
expressing a musical  system of communication learned from
 
his parents and grandparents  and culture.
 
"Juba" -
 Bessie Jones
 
Apparently refers  to a dance  "Juba Dance."
 No one really
 
knows what it is or how to do it.
 Some African  specialists
 
suggest that it is a result of West African Day Names.
 
Bessie's  traditional  explanation  (Folk Etymology)  can be
 
right in emotional  terms or in importance to people now.
 
Not necessarily from an historical  or scientific point of
 
view.
 
Bessie's  grandfather told her that Juba used to be Giba
 
-
 short for giblets  (leftovers).
 "That's all  they got to
 
eat is  leftovers.
 That's why Juba Dance.
 They talked about
 
it and didn't have to carry it around with them.
 Juba is
 
the emodiment of overlaying musical  systems one on top of
 
the other:  voice talking in 2 and hands clapping in 3.
 That's
 
really where syncopation is  at.
 Implicit in any style of
 
syncopation is  the existence of  2 voices.
 According to
 
specialists in African music,  the basic beat that we respond
 
to is never sounded.
 
All Afro-American music uses:
 
1.
 Rhythm as  a response-reaction-to a statement
 
2.
 Layered syncopation as  a response to pitch.

Rec.  Reading:  A. M.  Jones -
 Studies in African Music  
After the deve lopment of body music to amplify sound,
 
people started using things  that were just laying around -  
sticks,  pots and pans,  etc.
 
Rhythmic play is not  a question of talent.
 It is,  rather,
 
a question of culture pattern.
 A style of music has been
 
started early and importance has been stressed.
 It becomes
 
more and more enlarged as you get older.
 
Musical talent has to do with the musical parameters of
 
what your society offers you.
 As we get older we build on
 
these qualities.
 
Almost all  of us were born with the same cupful  of avail-
able musical  qualities.
 Middle-class whites have been sub-
dued in a sort of quiescent way to develop musica lity or beat.
 
Country people enlarged o n  this and used available mater-
ials  around the house,  ergo -
 Jug Band is  composed of  stuff
 
around the house.

The term fiddle is the folk -term for violin.
 They are one
 
and the same.
 
U.S.  Fiddle style is distinguishable from British fiddle style

 drone  (steady unmodulated pitch on a string that  gives
 
a bagpipe sound  (Amer.  style).
 
4.
 Length of melodic line and pure tone will be sacrificed
 
for beat and drive.
 This is due to Afro-American influ-
ence.
 An almost percussive fiddle style particularly in
 
the South.
 In New England it is  "purer"  and more easily
 
traced back to Northern Europe due to the lack of cross-
cultural  contact with Afro-Americans
 
All  music from Arkansas is  strange  (categorically).
 
Ozark position is one of balance because it was the major
 
jumping off point for western migration.
 
1.
 New England went South to Arkansas to  go west.
 
2.
 The south went north to Arkansas to  go west.
 
3.
 Many stayed,  however,  and their music blended both
 
North European and Afro-American elements.
 Survival of
 
the style was encouraged by the isolation of the area.
 
Plucked Instruments
 
1.
 Mouthbow:  on6­ of the oldest  in terms of historical  per-
spective
 
A.
 primitive in the  sense that it is non-developed.
 
Minimal  thing to make music.
 
1)  Distribution -
 South America,  Africa and remote
 
parts of  the far east.
 Twenty years ago it  showed
 
up in the Ozarks.
 
a)  Very surprising because even though it was
 
used in South America,  it was not  thought to
 
have come to the U.S. but maybe from Mexico.
 
b)  Two trains of thought
 
(1)  Re-invented rather than transmitted.
 
(2)  Indians in America could have had the mouth-
bow in active tradition.
 This is possible
 
since they had a bow in their culture.
 
2)  Construction:
 Best bows are made from very thin
 
wood  (part of an old spinning wheel per Jimmy
 
Driftwood)  with a "G"  string.
 
3)  Technique:
 Jam the wood against  cheek  and pluck
 
the  string.
 Based on the principle of  amplifying
 
the partials  and overtones by using the mouth as
 
as  an amplifier for the bow.

 Jews Harp:  nothing to do with Jews.
 Charles  Seeger says
 
it might  at one time have been called Jaws Harp -

Series of partials  (overtones or harmonies -

 This  suggests  that  the major

 All  societies have parts of the major

 and some have
 
more.

Instruments are built in logical ways  and musical  systems
 
do resemble each other in terms of physics.
 
Some instruments are built so that it  can only be played
 
in a major scale in the key it was made or tuned.
 
Diatonic Scale (Greek Harp).
 Major scale tuning modes -
 or
 
modal -
 built into and on the major scale.
 
Mixelidian Mode. 
Flat  7th "Old Joe Clark"  1/2 major and 1/2
 
minor.
 
Minor modes have survived in rural  areas while the major
 
scale is favored by city people.
 
Folk play simply constructed instruments;  that is,  instru-
ments  that can only be played in one key.
 That's probably
 
why the Dulcimer caught on.
 
Dulcimer -
 2 types
 
1.
 Hammer Dakimer -
 very elaborate
 
a.
 From central  Europe and not found frequently in U.S.
 
It never caught on.
 To hard to play and keep in
 
tune and carry around.
 
2.
 Appalachian or mountain or plucked dulcimer
 
a.
 German and Dutch immigrants were earlier than
 
Balkan immigrants  (Northern Europe)  in colonial  times
 
in Pennsylvania.
 It then moved south to modal  tunes.
 
Harmonica -
 scaler instrument without drone.
 Only one scale -  
sometimes referred to as a mouth harp or harp.
 
Non_intellecual5 pick up an instrument and whang away at
 
it and don't concern themselves with how it's  constructed or
 
what it means and what kind of sounds they can get  from it.
 
Negro  style -
 minor  5th and flatted 7th -

Instrumentation continued
  
Banjo,  Mandolin and guitar as  a group:
 
1.
 Fretted instruments
 
2.
 Probably items  (like all  things probably do)  from india.
 
3.
 In the U.S.  the oldest is the banjo -
 many feel  it is
 
indiginous or invented here in U.S.
 But ethnomusicologists
 
feel  that it was re-invented.
 
Banjo  
1.
 Drawn head with strings  stretched over it that extend
 
along the neck.
 Gives  a dry rather than mellow sound.
 
2.
 Was  a black invention -
 played exclusively by black
 
people and invented around the Civil War.
 
3.
 Natural  that it  should be played instead of drums -
 not
 
the same connotation to it.
 
4.
 After emancipation attention was geared toward American
 
Negro life.
 It started out  as  an intellectual  interest
 
(social  and politics)  then moved to  the level of popular
 
inters .

 Ergo -
 beginning of Minstrelty
 
a.
 An attempt  to reproduce plantation music  (or what was
 
thought of as plantation music).
 
b.
 Negroes were actually active in the beginning and
 
started the tradition.
 Because it was jazzy and hot
 
stuff,  it became a hot commercial product and big-
time money.
 
6.
 In ten years time:
 
a.
 Entrepreneurs who learned the styles of the black
 
man and turned the minstrel  show into a big money
 
extravaganza with orchestras,  managers  and marquis.
 
This type of show was a precursor to vaudeville.
 
b.
 While this was going on,  the original  folk  got
 
crowded out  (too  simple and not extravaganZic enough)
 
and we end up with white interpretations  and changes
 
C.
 Cultural  determination -
 the Negro pulled out  com -
pletely. 
Along with that he stopped playing the banjo
 
as well.
 (Bess had never  seen a country black person
 
play a banjo).

Basic Points:
 
1.
 Minstrelty started out  as  folk theatre.
 It was  enor-
mously important.
 Brought black music and people all
 
over the world a paved way for world-wide acceptance of
 
jazz.
 
2.
 When whites took it over they kept it  "blackf ace "
 
Negroes dropped it  and the banjo.
 Ergo,  sterotypiL
 cl
 
the black man permeated Anglo culture.
 The caricatu
 
of black culture nauseated the black man.
 
3.
 Banjo fell into disuse in early part of 20th century
 
Whites didn't know how to play it and Negroes wouldn'
1 
Until -
 -
 -
 Joe Sweeny added a drone string and it
 
caught on in the Southern white community.
 (The black
 
banjo had 3 or 4 strings).
 It was a good instrument 1:
 
the point of view of the southern white singer because
 
it is the ultimate
 in non-blend short-term tone.
 So
 
they had to play it fast -
 either strum or plunk.
 All
 
the chords didn't go with the  5th string so the pickin
 
out of a series of fast notes emerged.
 
4.
 The 1920's  saw the development of jazz  (complex harmonic
 
development).
 Because the keys changed,  couldn't use
 
a drone.
 So for  jazz band and orchestras,  the drc
 a
 
dropped.
 
5.
 1930's Depression:
 Music industry
 tried to cash
 
any market it could find.
 It turned to  small instrument
 
that would sell instead of traditional  piano.
 Ergo,  an

 Mexican-American and Spanish-American migration to New
 
Orleans with the New-England tradition coming down,
 
spread the popularity of  the guitar -
-
 B.H.
 
4.
 The guitar kind of killed the style of unaccompanied
 
singing.
 Emotionally speaking,  it killed the pioneer
 
period.
 However,  Americans  still  do  75% of their  singing
 
unaccompanied.
 But with the guitar it  allowed or encour-
aged a mixture of style.
 
End of 19th century,  early 20th century saw the introduc-
tion of the pump organ or parlor organ.
 It was a status  sym-
bol in the home.
 The only time whites  came together in
 
harmony was in church.
 They acted or tried to  act like they
 
could get along together.
 Harmony in religious  service en-
couraged harmony in cultural  style.
 
Autoharp (brand name).

2.
 Advertised in "WishbookS"  (mail order catalogues).

 Bible and the Almanac
 
major source of reading for country people.

 Autoharp got popular because of its  similar

to the parlor organ.  -

4.
 Functional use of Autoharp in music educatioc.
 
5.
 Country people ordered the harp with a book ci
 
tions but  the tendency was  to not read the instruction -_ 
It's to be played.
 Because it was called a harp,  they
 
picked it up and played it like a harp.
 By placing vo.
 
ear on the soundbox,  you can let your hand work like
 
hand and not  a drag to  get  chordal effect;  that is,
 
melodic use of the harp rather than chordal.
 You  rec
 
can't flub.
 
6.
 Autoharp did not move into the black community because i
 
was too  simple for them.
 Mostly in white tradition.
 
a.
 Acceptance and popularization of instruments has to
 
do with how people are feeling at the time.
 These
 
factors  are not musical factors.

Ballads  and Ballad Scholars  
1.
 Francis James  Child -

 c
: L  L:
 
Great Britain to research the oldest forms of ballads.
 
He was not  aware that  there was  still  an active  singi
 
tradition of these ballads  and was interested in them
 
for their literary value.
 His research was oriented
 
the direction of the 19th century intellectual  game o:
 
"Origins."
 Because he was  so thorough  (pernicious pei
 
Bess),  he practically paralyzed research in the fielc.
 
Child ballads have become synonymous with tradition 1
1
 
and Child's work remains  the touchstone of balladry.
 
2.
 Cecil  Sharp -
 an Englishman who came to U.S.  around  i
 
1910 in search of ballads of British origin that had
 
survived and fluorished in the U.S.
 He operated on t
 
anthropological  principle that the oldest layers of a
 
tradition will be on the perimeter of a culture  and
 
at its center  (geographically).
 He left the Mother
 
country and came to the colonies  (Southern mountain.
 
and found his  "living tradition."
 He was not interes
 
in indiginous material,  only those of British origin.
 
He gave full  attention to  the  song as  a song  (melodic
 
lines),  and paid attention to the music.
 Did not tre
 
a song as only poetry.
 
3.
 Bertrand Bronson -
 at UC Berkeley,  has undertaken to pub-
lish all  the available music to the Child ballads from
 
published and recorded versions,  i.e.,  all melodic mater-
ial  associated with Child ballads.
 
4.
 Jeanne Thomas -
 collected in Appalaichia.  Phoney anti-
quarian in point of view.
 She would turn back  the
 
clock to preserve the quaint and the charming.
 
5.
 Richard Chase, like Thomas,  is a preserver of the old
 
for the sake of rural  charm.
 Not a terribly viable thing
 
to do.

tation.

 How did the ballad start?

 Where did they come from?

but what he was

 Nobleman,  professional poet,  pauper,  etc.

 Aligned with the communalists were those who  thou
 
that common people were not  able to create high

A good folklorist:
 
1.
 Is a good audience -
 appreciates  and responds
 
2.
 Doesn't impinge majority culture values  to  give an
 
abrupt cut-off to  the minority tradition
 
Let us turn our attention to the sub-processes of mass
 
culture:
 
There are 2 kinds of historical  truth that co-exist:  One
 
is the truth that really happened and the other is what every-
one thinks or wanted to happen.
 Both are equally true.
 
The more important question for the folklorist is what every-
one thought happened.
 Look  at what people decide to  forget
 
and what they decide to remember.
 
What's so good about  a ballad?
 Why does  it  survive?
 It
 
operates without  social pressures.
 There are no political,
 
social or economic benefits.
 They survive because  they are
 
satisfying.
 They deal with basic emotional  values.

lips"
 
Woody Guthrie's favorite ballad was  "East Texas Red."
 
He wanted people to  care about the things  that he cared
 
about.
 He felt it was necessary to deal with large groups
 
that nobody ever cared about.
 We could only care about one
 
or two at a time.
 
The ballad form was  such a good one that it was picked
 
up by the Afro-Americans.
 The best indiginous material was
 
written by Negroes.  (Note:  They were here in U.S.  NOT
 
in Africa).

The ballad is highly specialized and developed in the
 
British Isles.
 They crop up in the English speaking world.
 
The plot lines are often found in tales as well as  the ballad.
 
The tale probably preceeded the ballad.
 
During their transfer from Britain to U.S.,  the ballads
 
lost  their preoccupation with "ghoulies  and ghosties  and
 
things  that go bump in the night"  (i.e.  pre-christian).
 They
 
became:

 Highly realistic

3.
 Highly tense and personal  inter-family and other inter-

Ballad Tradition in U.S.
 
1.
 Most  traditional ballads  are  sung by women and not by
 
men.
 They are taught by women to their daughters.
 Men
 
don't learn them but do listen to  them.
 
2.
 They express  the tensions of the pioneer woman in a male
 
dominated society.
 The female was isolated in the home
 
with children,  housework,  etc.,  so she had lots of time
 
to fantasize about certain things.
 
a.
 long lost love
 
b.
 killing children
 
3.
 Via the expression of the ballad,  she indulged in all
 
kinds of forbidden behavior.
 She couldn't possibly
 
suggest these fantasies for real,  so they have to end
 
tragically.
 
4.
 Still present is a strong masculine rural  tradition.
 
Not just rural but  stems from pioneer tradition of iso-
lation.
 Females were the emotional  core and could inter-
vene with the male's  authority in the house and provided
 
protection for the children.
 
5.
 Folk often refers to  a ballad as a "love song"
 
B.H.
 Music happens in time and you can't rush it or it's
 
no  good.
 
Using Barbara Allen as the take-off point,  discussion of
 
ballad tradition in U.S.  continues.
 
6.
 Ballads have a tendency to  get  shorter and  shorter
 
as  they go along -
 in historical  terms.
 That is,  we must
 
examine what gets  left out and what gets  left in.
 How
 
is  story altered?

7.
 We can sometimes tell how old a ballad is by the gradu
 
change and tightening up of the story in terms  of  lvrJ-
cal,  emotional  and symbolic content.
 
Folk songs  like all  other forms refl
:
 
attitudes,  and sentiments of the era,  e. g.,  the Jewish s
 
fice of Christian life to protect Jews.
 "The Jew's Daughter"
 
or "The King's Daughter."
 
The basic tragedy is altered to fit local  prejudices  and
 
local  needs.
 The probable reason that  songs  survive is  that
 
they have the emotional  core around which variation can
 
circulate and alter to  fit the needs and attitudes of the folk
 
population.

"Little Matty Grove" or  "Lord Masgrave and Lady Barnard"
 
dropped out of British tradition,  i.e.,  not reported from
 
Britain in this  century.
 
Storyline: 
Lady Barnard and Mattygrove are in church
 
and she invites him to come to her that evening.
 He declines,
 
at first,  because he knows  that  she's married.
 Finally he
 
accepts.
 That evening they are in bed together and Little
 
Matty Grove hears a horn blowing.
 He thinks it's Lord
 
Barnard coming earlier than expected but is persuaded by
 
Lady Barnard to  stay.
 But in the meantime -
 -
 -
 a little
 
pageboy has overheard the invitation and acceptance.
 He
 
tips off Lord Barnard.
 Barnard kills Little Matty Grove with
 
his  sword.
 After which he  asks his wife whom she liked
 
best.
 She tells him that  she preferred Little Matty Grove.
 
Upon hearing that,  he kills her and then so distraught,
 
kills himself.

The point is  that those ballads that are able to be
 
varied on and are flexible enough to build own cultural  fan-
tasy around,  are those ballads  that maintain and persist.
 
Others drop out of active tradition.
 
Anglo-American ballad singers remove themselves physi-
cally from the situation.
 A mountain singer considers
 him-
self as a mechanical  "let-er out"  of the ballad.

Ballad,  in folk  terms,  means a written copy often pro-
nounced  "Ballit."
 Some scholars  think  that there is  a cor-
relation between the words ballad and ballot.
 
Most folk singers have  a written version of their reper-
toire.
 This indicates  a desire to replicate and validate.
 
Collections of  these written versions are called "Ballit
 
Books" or "Ballad Box."
 They are handed down through fami-
lies..  The pOirit is  that  there is  and ha s been
 an  in terlock
 
between print and oral  tradition for some time.
 So,  don't  
over-stress orality.
 Print is used to preserve an item,  not
 
necessarily to  transmit it.
 Collecting Tip: 
When investiga-
ting Ballad Books,  never  suggest  there is value in terms  
of money. 
If there is any suggestion of cash value,  your
 
informant will probably keep it and never give it up.
 
Problem of the ballad as  a source of information:
 How
 
did they get  started?
 
1.
 (?)  Newspaper account of what was  going on was  Child's
 
idea and an academic error.
 
2.
 Must have been about real people doing real  things.
 
3.
 The problem is  that we can't  go back far '
enough to really
 
identify the validity of characters.

ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL

 Showed The Broadside Ballad by Leslie
 Shepherd.
 
Broadside tradition moved from rural  to urban setting be-
cause the singers had to  go where there was a crowd.
 
With the Broadside came  the beginning of several  indus-
tries.
 
1.
 Newspaper
 
2.
 Commercial music publishing companies
 
3.
 Recording industry
 
The Broadsides were replaced by the above and although we
 
see that  later forms  share a number of characteristics,  we
 
also see the impinging of the industrial process on oral
 
tradition.
 
Broadsides never really functioned as  a newspaper but as
 
a hook on which to hang folk beliefs.
 (Not what really
 
occured but what we think occured.)

"The Unfortunate Rake"
 
In its earliest form of a Broadside,  it is  questionably
 
dated from the late 17th century.
 It might  have been in
 
oral  tradition and "borrowed" by the ballad printers.
 (Rec-
ommended reading -
 The Music of the Broadside Ballads by
 
Claude Simpson.)
 
This British ballad first came to North America via
 
Canada,  then to New England,  and eventually,  every  state in
 
the Union.
 French and Spanish ballads  came in further south.

The migration pattern of this ballad was  toward the North-
west  and South because these were the major streams of people
 
migration and frontier settlement.
 By 1900 the pre-indus-
trial  cattle industry and Chisolm Trail  were defunct.

At the "x",  the pattern starts to break.
 The Appalachian
 
area causes a great  change.
 The further south we  go,  the
 
greater are the cultural  differences due to political  and
 
economic isolation.
 A lot of the  traditional  south was
 
originally from New England and therefore full or morals  and
 
scruples.
 In the mountain areas  this Puritan
 pattern was
 
almost exclusively white.

A sense of personal  responsibility doesn't enter the

sailor and soldier,  it was  the "flash"  girl's fault.
 
New England brings  the curious reversal of protagonists:
 
which now becomes  a woman instead of a man.
 "Bad Girl's
 
Lament."
 In sexual  terms the onus remains  the same.
 Across
 
the Northern States -
 just becomes an accident,  not  a compli-
cated sage of how wicked  someone was.
 By the time the ballad
 
reaches the South,  the  good old American neuroses becomes

Time Setting:  After Civil War and before major industrial
 
Revolution.
 
Irish lumbermen and railroad men stream Northwest.
 De-
feated Southern whites  (sometimes  driving cattle)  were going
 
southwest.
 They met in places  like Kansas  and other key
 
Midwest areas where the two cultural  streams  criss-crossed.
 
Ergo,  the Cowboy version of  the ballad became the standard
 
even though the cowboy was only a fragment of the population
 
and his function only viable for a maximum of 30  years
 
(probably more like 10 years).
 Both the cowboy and his ver-
sion acted as a carrier and inseminator of  the cultural
 
tradition.
 
Streets of Laredo -
 parody -
 song reshaped to fit any
 
circumstance  (rewrite in terms of substitution).
 (Parody
 
is  a basic process in folk tradition because it is easier
 
to change a song around to  fit individual  needs or circum-
stances  than it is  to find a new one.)
 
Why is  this  song so  terribly important and significant to
 
Americans?
 (Needs  a proper content analysis.)
 
B.H.
 The recurring theme of untimely death is  the most
 
dramatic one.
 It is a theme that Americans are concerned
 
with ad nauseum. 
We can plug in all of the variants of
 
human life and occupations.
 Seems to  fit the structure
 
of how Americans  think things ought to be.

Ballads  comprise  a good percentage of  the folk repertoire.
 
Two big areas  are:
 
1.
 Occupational  Songs -
 sung after the job is done.
 
a.
 Song about the work at hand -
 quite flexible in form.
 
Ballad or descriptive.
 
2.
 Work  songs -
 sung while actually '
doing the work at hand.
 
a.
 Controlled,  determined,  and prescribed by the particu-
lar work  going on at the moment.
 Work  song stops
 
when job is finished -
 even in the middle of the
 
verse.
 
b.
 Purpose:  to maximize amount of energy concentrated
 
.at any one moment in time  (positively or negatively).
 
C.
 Function:  to keep the work  going long after the human
 
will would want to continue working.
 To coordinate
 
(cadence and pace)  physical resources and job needs
 
at hand.
 The  job  determines  the  song.
 Work  song
 
leader is valuable because of his intimate knowledge
 
of the job and his  ability to  select a song that will
 
work best  for the  labor to be performed.

 Work  songs  (sung on the job)  Chantys  (chantey):  either
 
from French verb chanter (to  sing)  or after the name of
 
the dwellings lumbermen lived in.
 
During the summer,  spring and fall,  men would put out
 
to sea.
 During winter they became lumbermen,  ergo  cross-
fertilization of tranditions.
 
Shanty boy: 
generic term used through the profession
 
and by loggers  themselves,  to refer to a lumberman.
 
Shanty man: 
work specialist and coordinator on the
 
ship.
 He organized the jobs  and led the  singing.
 Paced
 
the job.
 Usually came to his job because he was  an older and
 
more experienced hand.
 
The utility of the work  song is its fascinating point.
 
Eternal human determination to create order and beauty out
 
of corruption and chaos.

Short haul  shanty: 
The  specific nature of the job was
 
to tighten an already hoisted sail,  i.e.,  to tighten an
 
already taut rope.
 A job for approximately 10 men.
 
Long haul or halyard shanty: 
Longer songs with a more
 
frequent rhythm,  i.e.,  more places in the song to pull
 on the
 
rope.
 "Blow the Man Down."
 (Double entendre song)
 
Capstan shanty. 
Used while the anchor was being raised
 
or lowered;  a slow long process done by turning the winch
 
(that's winch not wench).
 
Pumping shanty: like the capstan because it was  for a
 
practically interminable job.
 Pumping water was a rotten
 
job but the most beautiful  shantys,  e.g.  "Shenandoah."
 
Folksongs embody a direct emotional  statement.
 Via folk
 
process,  the content is boiled down to a core of emotional
 
force.
 
Waulking Work  song: 
"Waulking is the method used in the
 
Outer Hebrides  to  shrink  the newly woven cloth,  which is
 
sewn together to form a complete circle and then soaked in
 
hot urine.
 It is  placed on a table,  on either side of

which are  two rows of women who pass the cloth around sun-
wise,  using a rhythmic,  kneading motion in time to the song.
 
The chorus,  or fonn, is sung by the whole company and is
 
usually a set of meaningless vocables.
 The solo singer
 
sings the narrative lines,  and often these pieces are of
 
great length."
 (from the descriptive notes of Ballads  and
 
Songs of Scotland sung by Norman Kennedy,  p.  16,  Folk-Legacy
 
Records Inc.  1968).
 This tradition exists in the U.S.  as
 
well.
 
Field Holler  (Cry): African  salves in the U.S.  were not
 
allowed to speak with one another while working in the fields.
 
In order to establish communication with others,  he used the
 
Field Holler;  which is a lone man singing (not a group)  in
 
free form and free rhythm.
 It is an interior exterior
 
monologue;  a highly personal reflective statement.
 Still
 
viable in Afro-American trandition.

Development of religious music in United States is
 
marked by interaction between Afro-American and Anglo-Irish
 
traditions.
 
From the very beginning of settlement in the U.S.,  we
 
were involved in religion.
 The colonies were
 interested
 
in freedom of religious thought and action for themselves. 
They possessed energetic religious convictions.
 
1.
 Protestant church:  plain church and plain people.
 No
 
ornamentation and no display of weath.
 A "peoples'
 
church."
 
2.
 With the Protestant Revolution,  the church became more
 
involved with the postponement of pleasure.
 
3.
 The attitude of  the church toward music:
 
a.
 Catholic liturgy and such went out the window.
 
b.
 Big drive to find suitable hymns and get responsive
 
readings from the  songs.
 But they were written and
 
most members of the congregation couldn't read.
 
Ergo,  couldn't benefit from the philosophic statement.
 
C.
 The minister could sing one line and the congregation
 
repeated it back  to the minister.
 This style is
 
known as  "lining-out."
 
4.
 In the U.S.,  there was also a tradition known as long-
meter or surge-singing -
 an emotionally intere sting
 
style.
 
a.
 The act of singing was supposed to be a direct act
 
of worship.
 It had to be separated from secular
 
activity which made it pretty non-musical.

b.
 Eliminated rhythm,  threw out harmony and dragged
 
out the melodic line.
 
C.
 "Corporal"  elements had to be eliminated to better
 
concentrate on the act of worship.
 
d.
 Began to  sound beautiful.

 Shape -
 note hymns -
 instead of standard musical notation,
 
hymns were noted according to  shape;  that is,  each spot
 
on the scale  (do,  re,  fa,  so,  etc.)  would correspondsto
 
a certain shape.  D  t

Harp"  (Denson Revision)
 
Surge singing was picked up by Afro-Americans  and they
 
modified it to the form of antiphony  (call  and response)
 
which became a basic pattern that was comfortable for them.
 
Emotional impetus.
 
Reference to:  Dr.  Watt's Hymn Book.
 
The tonal  quality was  different between Anglo-Americans
 
(acid)  and Afro-Americans  (blended).
 
With the writing of the U.S.  Constitution,  it is the first
 
time in man's history that freedom of religion is  guaranteed.
 
Real  freedom means that responsibility rests on every single
 
individual.
 Each one had to  come to  grips with his own God.
 
Each one must make his own decision.
 They couldn't rely on
 
parents bringing them up  as one thing or another.
 This free-
dom focused attention on religion.
 The urgency of emotion
 
was not expressed by long-meter singing.
 So we had to have
 
"hotter"  tunes -
 parodies of folk tunes.
 Using actual  folk
 
tunes in a sacred context was  sinful.
 
Shout: 
Dancers form a circle in the center of the floor,
 
one in back of the other.
 Then they begin to  shuffle in a
 
counter-clockwise direction around and around,  arms out and
 
shoulders hunched.
 Rhythm builds up.
 This is actually a
 
West African circle dance.
 It survived more or less by acci-
dent.
 The Protestant religion discourages dancing and play-
ing of instruments.
 But dancing is defined as  crossing the
 
feet,  and in this religious  ceremony of West Africa,  the
 
dancers never cross  their feet anyway.
 Further,  drum rhythms
 
can be easily improvised by clapping and stomping.
 (From
 
The Story of Jazz by Marshall  Stearns,  p.  18).
 To avoid bein
 
confused with secular dance,  the should must be done "right."
 
Continuous interlocking o
f movement,  clapping,  and dancing
 
create the emotional blend in which participants  are mutually
 
sustained.
