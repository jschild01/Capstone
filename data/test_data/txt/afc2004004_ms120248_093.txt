The Gimo Gods.
Gimo Roche,
Gimo D'l'eau
Gimo gran chémin
Marassa Gimo
When these families are fed it is in this order:  Gimo, to open the
way, then the Rada, then the Congo and finally the Loua.
The Rada Gods , who are the strongest, eat chicken, beef, etc.; the
Congo "mange toute melange"; the Loua eats "bête sans plume" (beast
without hair), that is [pig] pork.
From Augustin a man, who was even among Haitiens most [confiedit] confidential
in giving me information produced a [gave a] slightly different version [fo]
of the general structure of Vaudou in the North than Lile.  His interest
[was rather more in] ran to the food rather than [in] to the names of Gods. [and]
The Gimo are to be fed on [Wednes] Tuesday with black chicken (caye),
ruffled chicken, "cabrite bai(cream-colored goat), accasan, pistache,
banane raché, figue, bon-bon, pain, and parched corn (maiz gruye).
When the gods and the celebrants have eaten, the latter wash
their hands and bury the remnants in two holes before the hounfort
door, being careful to throw in in the water from the hand-washing and
the unbroken bones of the goat [unbroken].  [On top] Several stones are placed 
on top of the pile of waste, the earth patted down over these and
the [Marrassa] Gimo are fed for all time.
