               C   Campaigns should be directed, not against any particular phony (except in very rare, serious cases), but against the ignorance 
that begets the phoneys.

Ⅵ      Personnel should apply general principles to themselves.

              A   Phoneys should not be passed in an office diverted to their elimination.
 
              B    Workers should make themselves experts in critical thinking and the psychology of cognitive activities.

              C    The reporting and analytical staff should be anonymous  ---- to 
get appropriate public commendation only after the dissolution 
of the project.

              D    The directors and advisory council members should be made known to the public. The success of the project depends largely 
upon the skills of these people and the confidence they inspire.

              E     All material dealt with by the unit is to be considered " confidential" in the strict sense of the term and only released through 
the project director or as specifically directed by him.
