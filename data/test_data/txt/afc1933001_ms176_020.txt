Dear Alan: ;

I hope earnestly that the two disks I shipped you by air express
Monday night reached you safely and quickly.

Ever since then I have been mentally exploring the extraordinary
possibilities which this recording technique has in our wartime
situation as well as afterward. You have my profound admiration
for having conceived the idea and having spurred me - and no doubt
other folklore people - to try it out. It opens up a field which
has not before been touched by the radio, and a field of enormous
importance to Americans. It heightens their consciousness of
themselves as Americans, and it contributes vitally to civilian
morale in expressing what the common people of the nation are
feeling and thinking, and expression of others than governmental
leaders, radio commentators, and newsmen.

By this time of the week I am so certain of its continued usefulness
that I want very much to have a continuing and developing
part in it. Surely it is being continued, isn't it? And on what 
basis?

Whatever the basis, potential or actual, I want to talk with you
about it. I can come to Washington anytime after December 15th
for that purpose.

My own plans need to be set by the first of the year, and I have
several in embryo now. But by far the most appealing and important
possibility is with the recording technique which you and I tried
last Monday. Even if the returns from other folklorists were not
much, I am certain that the two disks I cut are alone sufficient
proof that we must go on with a widespread and down-to-earth project
of this sort for the duration of the war. I have solid friendships
with several Washington people whose support of such a project would
probably assure it. You have too, I know. I'm merely suggesting
a coalition of forces, with confidence that such as Mrs. Roosevelt
and Charles Seeger will be interested in the project and in any
connection I may have with it.

This, you must understand, is no attempt to muscle in on something
you have started, but entirely an earnest desire to be of service
to the wartime project which I can most wholeheartedly and efficiently
put myself into.
