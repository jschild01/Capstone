1.  Only recently a man with both arms permanently 
disabled was called by his draft board and inducted. 
This somewhat angered him that he a man with no 
arms should be inducted, so on being assigned to his 
army post he asked his superior officer, what could 
he do. The officer pointed out a soldier drawing water 
from a well and pouring it into a large barrel. 
But the no-armed said to the officer "I can't do 
that because I do not have any arms. Well said 
the officers thats just where we can use you, be-
cause you see the soldier drawing water is blind 
and you can tell him when the barrel is full.
2. A young Negro lad decided to enlist in the Air 
Corps and went to the Recruiting Office to sign 
up. After a few preliminary questions, he 
finally was asked where he would like to 
take his training’, he answered "Randolph Field, 
Texas. The examiner dismissed him soon after 
stating that he would be called in a few 
days. He has not be called yet.
3.  A toast to the Japanese and German navies, Bottoms Up.
