   <abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Summary">
    Collection of manuscripts, sound
            recordings, graphic images, and moving images created and collected by John Cohen. The
            materials document Cohen's parallel careers as a musician (member of the New Lost City
            Ramblers) and writer during the 1960s American folk music revival, and his celebrated
            work as a documentary photographer and filmmaker, producer, and artist from the 1950s to
            the present. Includes interviews made by Cohen with John Hartford, Harry Smith, Roger
            McGuinn, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Gary Davis, John Summers, Cousin Emmy, Roscoe Holcomb,
            Charlie Higgins, Wade Ward, Friends of Old Time Music, High Atmosphere, and photographs
            of these and others including E. C. Ball, Clancy Brothers, Elizabeth Cotten, Willie
            Dixon, Jack Elliott, Woody Guthrie, Mary Frank, Lilly Brothers, Alan Lomax, Bill Monroe,
            Earl Scruggs, Mike Seeger, Stanley Brothers, Belle Stewart, Stony Mountain Boys, Merle
            Travis, Muddy Waters, Doc Watson and many others. The collection includes documentation
            of Greenwich Village and Harlem, New York City; Cohen's travels to Paris and Spain in
            the 1950s; and later to England, Wales, Scotland, Germany, Italy and Japan, and other
            countries. Notable is his research for his master's thesis on Peruvian textile weaving,
            and subsequent fieldwork in Peru. Subsequent projects in Peru incorporated sound
            recordings of Andean music, and films as well as books about weaving, music, festivals,
            and dance. The majority of Cohen's Peru photographs were taken during his first three
            trips there and focus primarily on indigenous Andean people in the Q'ero region.

    Biographical Note
   </head>
   <p>
    John Cohen was born in 1932 in Queens, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, Israel Cohen
            and Sonya (Shack) Cohen, and raised on Long Island. Cohen earned a bachelor of fine arts
            (1951) and completed a master of fine arts (1957), both from Yale University. As an
            undergraduate, Cohen studied painting with artist and educator, Josef Albers, but
            shifted his focus to photography after being exposed to Robert Frank's documentary
            photography work. He studied with modernist photographer Herbert Matter, who Cohen
            assisted on a project documenting performances of gospel music in Harlem. Cohen's
            deepening artistic sense, combined with learning about weaving customs of Peru through
            an archeology course, would lead him to travel to the Peruvian Andes, write his master's
            thesis on their weaving customs, and commence his lifelong involvement documenting
            Andean communities.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cohen was also an active musician. While at Yale, he organized music festivals and
            continued his work presenting concerts later in New York City during the emergence of
            the folk revival. In 1958, Cohen founded the New Lost City Ramblers, along with Mike
            Seeger and Tom Paley (replaced by Tracy Schwarz in 1962). The New Lost City Ramblers was
            an old time string band that embraced a respect for rural Appalachian traditions and
            canons, while infusing originality and making the music accessible to folk revival
            audiences in New York City and throughout the United States. The band created more than
            20 albums together.
   </p>
   <p>
    While living in New York City during the late 1950s, Cohen became involved with the
            Avant Garde and Abstract Expressionist art world. Robert Frank, Cohen's next door
            neighbor, enlisted Cohen as still photographer of
    <title>
     <part>
      Pull My Daisy
     </part>
    </title>
    , the influential Beat Generation film directed by Frank, written by Jack
            Kerouac, and featuring Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gregory Corso, David Amram, and
            others. In addition to documenting the artistic Avant Garde art and literary world of
            his New York neighborhood, Cohen photographed significant folk musicians, such as Woody
            Guthrie and a young Bob Dylan. He was a founding director of the Friends of Old Time
            Music, a group including Ralph Rinzler and Izzy Young, which presented 14 concerts of
            traditional musicians to New York audiences for the first time. Performers included
            Roscoe Holcomb, the Stanley Brothers, Maybelle Carter, Doc Watson, Mississippi John
            Hurt, and Dock Boggs. In addition to using his musical and personal connections for
            booking artists, John did the artwork and design for posters and fliers for many of the
            concerts.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 1965, Cohen married Penelope (Penny) Seeger (1943-1993), daughter of the well-known
            musicians and musicologists Ruth Crawford Seeger and Charles Seeger. Penny was a singer
            and musician, as were her siblings, Barbara, Peggy, Mike (John Cohen's band mate in the
            New Lost City Ramblers), and half brother, Pete. Cohen and Seeger had two children,
            Sonya (1965-2015) and Rufus.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cohen's fascination with Appalachian and Andean culture inspired him to take many
            collecting trips to the Southern U.S. and to Peru, where he recorded, photographed, and
            produced films that presented the people and traditions in their cultural contexts. His
            work reflected his artistic sense and aesthetic. Cohen was a prolific documentary
            filmmaker, ultimately creating seventeen films through the course of his career,
            including

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    Collection of manuscripts, sound recordings, graphic images, and moving images created
            and collected by John Cohen. The materials document Cohen's parallel careers as a
            musician (member of the New Lost City Ramblers) and writer during the 1960s American
            folk music revival, and his celebrated work as a documentary photographer and filmmaker,
            producer, and artist from the 1950s to the present. Includes interviews made by Cohen
            with John Hartford, Harry Smith, Roger McGuinn, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Gary Davis, John
            Summers, Cousin Emmy, Roscoe Holcomb, Charlie Higgins, Wade Ward, Friends of Old Time
            Music, High Atmosphere, and photographs of these and others including E. C. Ball, Clancy
            Brothers, Elizabeth Cotten, Willie Dixon, Jack Elliott, Woody Guthrie, Mary Frank, Lilly
            Brothers, Alan Lomax, Bill Monroe, Earl Scruggs, Mike Seeger, Stanley Brothers, Belle
            Stewart, Stony Mountain Boys, Merle Travis, Muddy Waters, Doc Watson and many others.
            The collection includes documentation of Greenwich Village and Harlem, New York City;
            Cohen's travels to Paris and Spain in the 1950s; and later to England, Wales, Scotland,
            Germany, Italy and Japan, and other countries. Notable is his research for his master's
            thesis on Peruvian textile weaving, and subsequent fieldwork in Peru. Cohen visited Peru
            eight times between 1956 and 2005. Subsequent projects in Peru incorporated sound
            recordings of Andean music, and films as well as books about weaving, music, festivals,
            and dance. The majority of Cohen's Peru photographs were taken during his first three
            trips there and focus primarily on indigenous Andean people in the Q'ero region.

   </list>
   <p>
    Series 1-3 were arranged and described according to format, such as manuscripts and
            sound recordings. Series 4 was processed separately, and is mostly arranged topically,
            by Cohen's area of interest, such as Peru and Southern U.S. music, but there is also a
            large subseries that documents the administrative side of Cohen's teaching, writing,
            photography, and film making career. Sound recordings that do not fit into the topical
            subseries of Series 4 have been moved to "Series 2. Subseries 4. Sound recordings and
            moving image materials from 2020 accrual." Materials within the Series 4 subseries are
            arranged alphabetically except for the "Original Artwork" subseries, which is arranged
            chronologically.

    Headings in titles, such as "New Lost City Ramblers" and "Hidden Threads of Peru," were
            provided to uphold the collection's original order according to the topics of Cohen's
            projects and endeavors.

       John Cohen's collection of approximately 450 45rpm commercial discs of Huayno
                     music, traditional music of Andean people, which he assembled in Lima, Peru in
                     1988-1989 while working on a film about Huayno music. Most songs are sung in
                     Spanish or in Quechua. Arranged by record label and catalog number. Performer
                     names are documented as well. In his notes about the Huayno collection, Cohen
                     writes, "there is a good representation of regional festival music, such as
                     Santiagos (from Huancayo), Carnivals, and Tijeras (from Ayacucho)." Contact the
                     Folklife Reading Room for further information about discs.

       The digitized contact sheets represent photographic negatives taken by Cohen
                     from the 1950s until the 2000s. Areas of coverage include Peru, music festivals
                     and performances, portraits of artists and musicians, film stills and
                     production photos, as well as his early photographic work. Also included are
                     family photographs. Notable figures appearing in the contact sheets include
                     Roscoe Holcomb, Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Earl Scruggs, Martin Luther King,
                     Jr., Elizabeth Cotten, Eck Robertson, John Lomax and Bill Monroe.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Cohen's life and career are divided into four major series: Yale/New
                     Haven and Early Years (A series and F series); New York-Art and the Beat Scene
                     (G and H series); Musicians (F, G, H, I series); and Peru (D and E series). The
                     file names (digital identifiers) include these series designations in the
                     letters assigned prior to the identifier number. Descriptions of contact sheets
                     are from the collection inventory provided by John Cohen.

      Large accrual complementing the 2011 John Cohen collection. Manuscripts and
                  audiovisual materials encompass much of Cohen's career and personal interests.
                  Digital content (optical media and floppy disks) is unprocessed and has been

      The accrual/series is mostly arranged topically, by Cohen's area of interest, such
                  as Peru and Southern U.S. music, but there is also a large subseries that
                  documents the administrative side of Cohen's teaching, writing, photography, and
                  film making career. Subseries are arranged alphabetically except for the "Original
                  Artwork" subseries, which is arranged chronologically.

         Working digital files related to the making of Cohen's 2014 documentary
                           film, "Visions of Mary Frank." Digital content includes Final Cut Pro
                           project files and a range of audiovisual file formats and still image
                           formats that Cohen accumulated in the process of putting together the
                           film. Files are in their original directory structure. Many of the Final
                           Cut Pro files are very short clips, edits, render files or capture
                           scratch files. Includes files from the film's cinematographer, Harvey
                           Wang. Includes licensed materials subject to their own copyright.
