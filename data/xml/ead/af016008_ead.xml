     Jean Ritchie
    </head>
    <p>
     Jean Ritchie was born on December 8, 1922 in Viper, Kentucky, the youngest of 14
                    in a family of singers and musicians. She attended Cumberland Junior College and
                    later the University of Kentucky; at the latter she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in
                    1946, with a B.A. in social work. She taught children music at Henry Street
                    Settlement in New York City, and it was there that she met Alan Lomax, who
                    recorded her for the Archive of American Folk Song in 1951. Jean Ritchie was
                    involved in the folk music scene, performing with numerous others including
                    Woody Guthrie and Oscar Brand. She married George Pickow in 1950, and together
                    they built her career. They traveled together during Jean's Fulbright award year
                    abroad in 1952-1953, as she recorded folk singers in Great Britain and Ireland,
                    such as Seamus Ennis; and documented folk customs such as the May Day hobby
                    horse (Obby Oss) in Padstow, Cornwall. Jean was a published author (among her
                    best known works is her memoir and songbook
     <title>
      <part>
       Singing Family of the Cumberlands
      </part>
     </title>
     ), about her own family and their musical legacy. She recorded over
                    thirty albums, performed with countless individuals and groups over the span of
                    a 50-plus year career, popularized the dulcimer (she and George had a
                    dulcimer-manufacturing business), served on the board for the Newport Folk
                    Festival (circa 1963), and received a National Endowment for the Arts National
                    Heritage Fellowship (2002). She earned high regard and praise both in the U.S.
                    and abroad as an authentic representative of Appalachian music traditions. She
                    died June 1, 2015 in Berea, Kentucky.

    <p>
     George Pickow, born in Los Angeles, California, in 1922 and raised in Brooklyn,
                    New York, began his career in photography in the 1940s, after studying painting
                    at Cooper Union, in New York. He built his career working for the Three Lions
                    photo agency, publishing stock photos for magazines as varied as

     , and various "true stories"-styled detective magazines. He worked as a
                    documentary filmmaker in various roles (both in front of the camera and behind
                    it, as a director), most notably for

     </title>
     (1967) and documentaries on the British May Day and Padstow Obby Oss
                    traditions. In the 1950s he worked with Paddy Clancy and Lou Gordon as
                    presenters of Swapping Song Fair, which began as rent-raising midnight shows at
                    Cherry Lane Theatre. With Jean he ran the dulcimer-making business (his uncle
                    made the dulcimers) and the recording label Greenhays. He photographed Jean as
                    well as many of her contemporaries (Woody Guthrie, Doc Watson, and Mary Travers,
                    among others), and his photos also illustrated many of Jean's books. He
                    photographed dozens of album covers for the popular stereophonic albums of the
                    1950s, as well as for Jean's albums. He died in 2010.

                                    Jean's appearances, and noted in her handwriting "1960s

        Album jackets from this era were frequently made of cardboard, with a
                                glossy sheet affixed to the front (and sometimes the back), with the
                                album title and artist, and usually an illustration. These are the
                                glossy sheets, most for popular and folk music, but some for
                                classical music. Two covers are printed on heavy-stock paper boards.
                                George took the photos and in some cases may have designed the
                                covers.

                                previously used tape that was not erased properly when the second
                                recording was made, the "original" recording is fairly audible and
                                most of it is an aircheck from FM radio of a folk music program. At
                                00:28:47:16 the "new" recording ends and the original recording
                                comes on full strength.

        While the documentation for these 35 mm color slides seems to
                                indicate they were taken at the Olympics, they may be in preparation
                                for the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Alan Lomax appears in two
                                photos, and some images may have been taken elsewhere.

       A dulcimer made in 1923 by J. Edward Thomas of Knott County, Kentucky.
                            Possibly walnut; three-string, half-fretted, with four heart-shaped
                            soundholes. The shape and the soundholes are the "Kentucky style,"
                            developed by Thomas. It can be seen in photos of Jean with a gathering
                            of her dulcimers, and on the cover of her album "The Most Dulcimer." It
                            appears near the bottom edge of the cover, and can be only partially
                            seen.
