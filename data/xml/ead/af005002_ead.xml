    Provenance

   <p>
    On September 12, 2001, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress sent an
            email to folklorists and other ethnographers across the nation asking them to record the
            thoughts and feelings expressed by individuals and communities following the terrorist
            attacks of September 11. This project echoes one conducted sixty years earlier, on
            December 8, 1941, when Alan Lomax, then in charge of the Archive of American Folk Song,
            sent an urgent telegram to folklorists around the country to collect "man on the street"
            reactions to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war by the
            United States.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within a week after the September 12 notice was sent, collection materials began to
            arrive at the Library of Congress. Mail delivery to the Library was abruptly interrupted
            from October 2001-May 2002, due to the discovery of envelopes containing anthrax in the
            Hart Senate Office Building, a part of the Capitol complex. During that time, items
            received via U.S. postal mail were sent offsite to be irradiated in order to rid them of
            possible anthrax contamination. When the mail delivery to the Library resumed, and
            collection materials finally began to arrive at the Center, fewer than one percent of
            items were discovered to be severely damaged or destroyed by the irradiation process.
            Attempts were made to contact donors of these items and some were able to provide
            information about the content of their interviews. The destroyed materials remain a part
            of the collection. Because of the mail delay, donations were accepted through 2002, as
            long as the materials were reflective of immediate reactions from the fall of 2001.

    Processing History
   </head>
   <p>
    This collection received much media attention in the fall of 2001 which prompted some
            immediate, but minimal, processing of the collection. Release forms and other manuscript
            materials were organized according to the donating institution's or individual's name.
            Some reference tapes were also made at this time. In addition, Ann Hoog, the curator of
            this collection, created an Access database to assist with the organization of and
            access to the materials. Data entry and some initial processing were done by Ann Hoog,
            and American Folklife Center interns, Tatiana Omeltchenko and Darryl Gonzalez;
            volunteer, Howard Kramer; and digital conversion specialists, John Barton and Myron
            Briggs. The processing was completed by Rosemary Graham and Valda Morris-Slack in 2003.

    Scope and Content Note
   </head>
   <p>
    On September 12, 2001, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress sent a
            notice to folklorists and ethnographers across the nation asking them to record on
            audiotape the thoughts and feelings expressed by individuals and communities following
            the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The project was developed by Ann Hoog, who
            collaborated with American Folklife Center Director Peggy Bulger in the original call
            for participation. Materials were mailed to the Library of Congress beginning in
            September 2001. The collection reflects the regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and
            political diversity of Americans at the time of the September 11 attacks.
   </p>
   <p>
    The collection comprises 8980 items: 8100 manuscript materials; 386 sound recordings
            (SR); 421 graphic and photographic materials (GR and PH); 20 moving images (MV); 15
            electronic media (CF); and 38 artifacts (AR). There are twelve boxes of manuscript
            materials divided into seven categories: Administrative Materials, Participant
            Documentation, Unpublished Writings, Reports, Published Works, Internet Folklore,
            Clippings and Online Articles. These include printout of e-mails, ephemera (from various
            internet web sites), posters, newspaper articles, personal essays, narratives,
            children's drawings, and other miscellaneous items that were left at the various
            memorials.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Participant Documentation series is arranged in sub-folders (a paper folder within
            an archival folder) according to the participants' last names and the ID numbers of the
            materials which pertain to the documentation. This arrangement ensures that the
            interviewer and the interviewee, and the primary materials (sound recording,
            photographic images, etc.) are readily identifiable. In some cases, there is no
            documentation accompanying a specific sound recording, photograph, or other type of
            medium. Therefore, in some sub-folders there is a "?" after the SR number. This
            indicates that the documentation most likely goes with that SR number, but the name on
            the form has not been linked definitively with that particular sound recording. There is
            a folder entitled "Participant Documentation (Michigan)." Originally there were no tapes
            accompanying the forms from Michigan State University (MSU). A few irradiated tapes were
            found which were subsequently linked to Michigan State University (MSU), but could only
            be identified and not played because of the extensive damage done to the tapes by the
            irradiation process. The participant documentation is also divided into "originals" and
            "photocopies" (as there was no way to verify which items had been irradiated, all the
            documentation was photocopied). All photocopied materials can be served to readers.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are twenty-two accounts of personal narratives and eleven poetic works within the
            Unpublished Writings subseries, and they are arranged chronologically. These accounts
            are the personal experiences of the writers on the day or days following September 11,
            2001. Other accounts recall events in the authors' lives months after the attacks.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Reports subseries consists of school projects that were submitted by several
            institutions such as Hunter College, Colorado College, and California State University.
            Each project was approached differently followed prescribed guidelines, which were to
            capture the thoughts and feelings expressed by the American people in the aftermath of
            September 11. For example, California State University presented its response in the
            form of a research project which incorporated the use of posters, overheads, cartoons,
            and newspaper clippings. The students at Colorado College, on the other hand, wrote term
            papers based on the interviews they conducted.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Published Works subseries consists of written articles and statements referring to
            the events and reactions to the attacks of September 11. The works include excerpts from
            the
    <title localtype="simple">
     <part>
      Congressional Record
     </part>
    </title>
    , press releases, photographs, flyers, brochures, and other ephemera.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Internet Folklore section is a compilation of Internet sites that comment on the
            events of September 11, through humor, images, memorials, legends, and Internet
            warnings.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Clippings and Online Articles subseries includes most of the California State
            University at Chico reports, which contain a large number of newspaper clippings. These
            clippings are included here and cross-referenced with the reports.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that the manuscript materials include database printouts that capture information
            about sound recordings, graphic and photographic materials, moving images, electronic
            media, and artifacts, all of which are available on hard copy and on a zip disk located
            in Box 1, Folder 2.

    The Sound Recordings series includes interviews with people who were in the World Trade
            Center and the Pentagon during the attacks, and also people living in East Sullivan,
            Maine; Des Moines, Iowa; Los Angeles, California, and many other towns and cities --
            small and large -- across the country. Twenty-eight states are represented. The
            collection includes interviews with teachers and students from elementary to graduate
            school; police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers; secretaries,
            executives, librarians, city officials, and people whose families have lived in the
            United States for generations as well as those recently arrived.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are approximately 200 interviews from New York City and Arlington, Virginia, but
            the majority of the interviews in the collection was gathered from other parts of the
            country. The content of the interviews include views on international relations,
            politics, economics, patriotism, charity efforts, fears of flying, prejudices, and how
            relationships were changed by the events of September 11, 2001.
   </p>
   <p>
    The total number of sound recordings given in the Concordance is accurate as of 2005.
            Additional items may be added. All of the sound recordings have been duplicated.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sound recordings database is available in the Folklife Reading Room organized by SR
            number and alphabetically by the interviewer's last name. The recordings are arranged
            alphabetically by state, institution of affiliation, interviewer's last name, and
            interviewee's last name. Using the "find" option in Access, researchers should be able
            to find a specific sound recording easily. A few sound recordings were added to the
            collection after the numbering arrangement was completed so the last recording, SR386,
            is not the final recording. The sound recordings were numbered consecutively regardless
            of format. Hence, the compact discs are not in sequence. Although the collection of
            audio recordings was the primary goal of this project, some people documented their
            community's reactions in photographs. Therefore, this collection also includes
            photographic documentation of some of the spontaneous memorial tributes created near the
            Pentagon, and in other parts of the country. These memorials, sign boards, and
            decorations all reflect the public discourse regarding the events. Candles and flowers,
            written messages and drawings from children, flags and other items, collectively express
            the grief and solidarity of individuals and businesses. The American Folklife Center
            (AFC) staff took photographs of memorials at Arlington Cemetery and near the Pentagon.
            The American Folklife Center (AFC) also received images from places such as Marietta,
            Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Las Vegas, Nevada. The digital graphic images are
            housed with the electronic media.
   </p>
   <p>
    Moving Images are arranged alphabetically by state and institution of affiliation. The
            Moving Image series includes interviews and patriotic songs pertaining to September 11,
            2001.
   </p>
   <p>
    Artifacts are organized by format and institution of affiliation. The artifact
            collection consists of materials that were gathered from a temporary memorial site in
            Knoxville, Tennessee or collected as part of a project. They include flags, posters,
            copper signs, and a sample of the irradiated tapes.
