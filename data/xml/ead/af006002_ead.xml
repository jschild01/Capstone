    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    The recordings in the American Dialect Society Collection consist of
		  893 audio discs (both originals and duplicates made from originals, which
		  replaced absent originals). 466 duplicate discs were subsequently delivered to
		  the Linguistic Archives at the University of Georgia, Athens; AFC retained the
		  original discs from which these were recordings were made. The 891 discs kept
		  by AFC include aluminum-based acetate discs, plastic discs, and 12 shellac
		  pressings made from the original recordings. In some cases the original disc no
		  longer exists and so the copy is the only source for the recording. In addition
		  there is one tape copy of eighteen discs duplicated in 1972 by Frederic Cassidy
		  at the University of Wisconsin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Notes found on the disc sleeves were written by various individuals at
		  different times. For example, they were written by interviewers and recordists
		  when the recordings were made, shortly afterwards by researchers for the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Linguistic Atlas of New England
     </part>
    </title>
    (LANE)
		project, and by researchers for the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Dictionary of American Regional English
     </part>
    </title>
    (DARE). Some of these notes are marked with initials and dates; others are not.
		The card indexes, disc inventories, and transcripts were made by students under
		the direction of Miles Hanley, at the University of Wisconsin, during the
		1940s. Because of Hanley's involvement, the collection is sometimes referred to
		as the "Hanley collection" or "the Hanley discs." Manuscript materials include
		documents produced during acquisition of the collection for demonstrations and
		presentation events (when the collection was formally given to the American
		Folklife Center), as well as material produced during the processing of the
		collection, and theses and articles related to the collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    The American Dialect Society recordings were made between 1931 and
		  1937. In the early 1930s the Society began a long-term project to document the
		  regional variation of American speech: The Linguistic Atlas of the United
		  States and Canada. The first published result of the project, the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Linguistic Atlas of New England
     </part>
    </title>
    (LANE),
		was published in three volumes between 1939 and 1944. Fieldworkers for the LANE
		project interviewed people in New England, and documented their speech with
		written phonetic transcriptions. Hans Kurath, director of the project and
		editor of LANE, suggested that fieldworkers make audio recordings of
		informants, in addition to the written transcriptions. Miles L. Hanley,
		associate director for
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      LANE
     </part>
    </title>
    , developed a system for recording
		sound on aluminum discs, which used several automobile batteries as a power
		source. With this disc-cutting machine in the back of his car, he traveled
		through New England, making recordings of many LANE informants. Later, other
		fieldworkers followed Hanley's practice and used recording equipment to gather
		information from informants from various regions as well as New England.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although the recordings the fieldworkers made were originally intended
		  as supporting data for the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Linguistic Atlas of New England
     </part>
    </title>
    , they were
		never used in this way. The recordings were used for teaching linguistics and
		for linguistic research. In the 1970s they provided material for the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Dictionary of American Regional English
     </part>
    </title>
    ,
		the first volume of which was published in 1985.
   </p>
   <p>
    Persons recorded include informants, fieldworkers, and staff members
		  for the LANE project. Many other individuals volunteered to have their speech
		  documented by the dialectologists. Since the scholars were interested in a
		  comprehensive dialect study of all of North America, they recorded speakers
		  from all regions as opportunities arose. They recorded a few foreign-born
		  speakers as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    The recordings are predominantly interviews with native New
		  Englanders, most of whom were elderly. As Margaret Waterman (see
    <ref actuate="onrequest" show="replace" target="appendixe">
     Appendix
			 E
    </ref>
    ) has pointed out, these interviews provide a record of the speech,
		  attitudes, and lives of people born in the 1840s and 50s. Other speakers
		  include scholars and those whose dialect or language proved interesting to the
		  collectors. The collectors also recorded their own voices, as they felt their
		  dialects might influence the collection and analysis of the dialects of others.
		  Among the famous persons recorded are actor/author Alistair Cooke, romance
		  philologist Charles H. Grandgent, folklorists John Lomax and Alan Lomax,
		  linguist Edward Sapir, and psychologist B.F. Skinner. Languages other than
		  English on the recordings include French, German, Hebrew, Hidatsa,
		  Passamaquoddy, and Zulu. The Gullah dialect is documented as well. Of
		  particular interest are the fifteen interviews with former slaves, and the
		  fifty-five recordings of storyteller Joshua Alley of Jonesport, Maine. Most of
		  the recordings are spoken-word narratives or interviews, although there are a
		  few recordings of songs. Informants were asked about their ancestry, so a good
		  deal of genealogical information is preserved on the recordings. People also
		  talked about their daily lives and their childhood memories, gave recipes, and
		  described work and play activities. In addition, informants also shared
		  personal-experience stories, legends, and traditional tales.
   </p>
   <p>
    Five fieldworkers made sound recordings in connection with
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Linguistic Atlas of New England
     </part>
    </title>
    : Bernard
		Bloch, Marguerite Chapallaz, Miles L. Hanley, Archibald A. Hill, and Guy S.
		Lowman Jr. Other collectors contributed recordings, disc copies, and/or
		assisted LANE collectors in making recordings in their regions: For example,
		Walter C. Garwick contributed the recordings made at Berea College, John Lomax
		contributed two discs of black work songs, and Lorenzo Turner assisted in the
		making of the recordings of Gullah dialect.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some discs were not marked with the collectors' initials, or the
		  collectors' information on the discs is incomplete. For this reason, other LANE
		  staff members who made recordings or participated in interviews did not receive
		  credit on the discs or disc sleeves. Hans Kurath, in particular, almost
		  certainly participated in many of the recording sessions. Many of the unsigned
		  notes in or on the disc sleeves are thought to be his. Notes on discs and disc
		  sleeves show that "J. D." made recordings with Marguerite Chapallaz. This was
		  Jane E. Daddow, a student of Hans Kurath. Contributing to the confusion as to
		  the identity of the collectors is that the recordist and the interviewer were
		  not always the same person. In addition to the researchers already mentioned,
		  Robert L. Stone served as recordist for many interviews. Notes on the discs and
		  disc jackets attribute some recordings to "Caffee" and "A. R. M.," who were
		  probably recordists. The full names of these individuals are not given in the
		  collection materials. See
    <ref actuate="onrequest" show="replace" target="appendixd">

   <p>
    The American Dialect Society was founded in 1889 for the study of the
		  English language in North America, and other languages and their dialects of
		  other languages as they relate to North American English. The Society produces
		  the journal
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      American Speech
     </part>
    </title>
    , and related monographs,
		holds annual and regional meetings, and sponsors the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Dictionary of American Regional English
     </part>
    </title>
    .
		From 1889-1939, it published the journal Dialect Notes. The Society's web site

    Listening and viewing access to the collection is unrestricted. The
		  American Folklife Center is the custodial division for this collection; the
		  original sound recordings are stored in the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and
		  Recorded Sound Division (hereafter M/B/RS), Library of Congress. Reference
		  copies of sound recordings are available in analog and digitized forms (WAV and
		  mp3 formats) through the Folklife Reading Room. Consult a reference librarian
		  in the Folklife Reading Room for specific information.
   </p>
   <p>
    An Access database contains entries for sound recordings and
		  manuscripts that were digitized as part of the Save Our Sounds project. This
		  database includes a short log for each recording, information on discs,
		  interpolations of notes on disc sleeves, and background information on some of
		  the recordings. This updated database is now available in the Folklife Reading
		  Room.
   </p>
   <p>
    Restrictions may apply concerning the use, duplication, or publication
		  of items in this collection. Consult a reference librarian in the Folklife

    The American Dialect Society Collection (also referred to as the ADS
		  Collection), includes disc recordings, typed transcriptions, and other
		  documentation related to research for the
    <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
     <part>
      Linguistic Atlas of New England
     </part>
    </title>
    , was
		donated to the Library of Congress on December 28, 1984, by the American
		Dialect Society. The collection originally included a number of duplicate
		discs, which were subsequently given to the Linguistic Archives at the
		University of Georgia, Athens. In cases where the original discs were missing
		from those donated to the Library, duplicated copies of those discs have been
		retained. In 1989 a tape comprising copies of some of the discs made by
		Frederic Cassidy, including seventeen recordings missing from the collection,
		were located among a separate collection of recordings loaned to the Library
		for duplication by the former president of the American Dialect Society, Raven
		I. McDavid. This tape has been added to the collection.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the collection was donated to the Library in 1984, AFC reference
		  librarian Gerald E. Parsons worked with linguists Katherine Langdon and Clare
		  O'Leary to listen to each of the discs, provide a quality review, and prepare a
		  database describing the content of each recording. In addition, the collection
		  was arranged, described, and prepared for preservation duplication by Ross
		  Gersten, Stephanie A. Hall, Francesca McLean, and John Vallier. In 2003-2004,
		  Marcia K. Segal directed digitization work on the sound recordings, and
		  finalized the collection guide. On July 7, 2000, the Save America's Treasures
		  program jointly awarded the American Folklife Center (Library of Congress) and
		  the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (Smithsonian Institution) a
		  $750,000 grant to save sound recordings and related materials (in other
		  formats) in danger of being lost through physical deterioration. This program
		  funded the Save Our Sounds project. The American Folklife Center selected
		  several of its own collections for inclusion in the Save Our Sounds Project,
		  including the American Dialect Society Collection. The digitization process was
		  not exhaustive, due to the small quantity of materials in the collection. Only
		  the audio disc recordings were digitized, because it was determined that ADS
		  Collection recordings on the 10-inch preservation tape, formerly believed to be
		  unique in the collection, existed in disc form (and thus an earlier generation)
		  in the collection.

      The American Dialect Society Collection's recordings consist of
				891 aluminum, aluminum-based acetate, plastic, and shellac disc recordings.
				Also included are one 10-inch preservation reel containing 18 recordings, and
				one audiocassette of presentation event recordings. In addition, there are 78
				10-inch preservation reels.
     </p>
     <p>
      869 audio discs (most originals, and some copies that stand in for
				original recordings no longer with the collection) were digitized in 2003 and
				2004. See Series IV (Electronic Media) for more details.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also 22 discs that were not digitized, because they are
				duplicates of recordings in the collection that were digitized. The copies have
				been kept with the collection. Correspondence related to these discs is found
				in the case file. The discs are in the physical custody of M/B/RS.
     </p>
     <p>
      The American Dialect Society centennial commemorative cassette is

    Interviewers and recordists were usually identified by initials or
		  other abbreviations on the discs or disc sleeves. Persons writing comments on
		  the disc sleeves also identified themselves with initials. Information about
		  the recording situation written by the recordist was sometimes included in
		  these notes, often in abbreviated form. The following list includes these
		  abbreviations and their meaning when known. In addition, some abbreviations and
		  terminology used in the collection materials and in articles about the
		  collection are listed here.
