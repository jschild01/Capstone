   <p>
    Since November 1997, Joel Martin Halpern has donated a substantial amount of
                materials related to his and his wife's ethnographic fieldwork to the American
                Folklife Center. Prior to arriving at the Library of Congress, a portion of this
                collection (33 audio recordings) was stored at The Amherst College Library. Upon
                Professor Halpern's request, these materials were deaccessioned in 1997, and he
                donated them to the American Folklife Center. Furthermore, 126 black-and-white
                photographs (see Box 13) were given to Joel Martin Halpern by the Ethnographic
                Museum in Sofia, Bulgaria in exchange for anthropology textbooks. Some of the
                unprocessed accruals to this collection will become part of other collections.

     Joel Martin Halpern
    </head>
    <p>
     Joel Martin Halpern was born April 8, 1929, in New York City. Halpern received a
                    B.A. in History from the University of Michigan in 1950, and in 1956 earned his
                    Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University. He started his teaching career
                    in 1955 as a lecturer in anthropology at Columbia; he then served as assistant
                    professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, from
                    1958 to 1963, and as associate professor of anthropology at Brandeis University
                    from 1963 to 1965. From 1965 to 1967 Halpern was an associate at the Harvard
                    University Russian Research Center. From 1967 until his retirement in 1992, he
                    was first associate professor and then professor of anthropology at the
                    University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His ethnographic research has been
                    supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the National
                    Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Canadian Government, the
                    National Academy of Sciences, the International Research and Exchanges Board
                    (IREX), and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as by the
                    University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Massachusetts,
                    Amherst.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout his career, Halpern has traveled widely and conducted extensive field
                    research. In the summer of 1950, he studied Eskimo settlements on the Seward
                    Peninsula of Alaska. In 1953-54 and during several other times throughout his
                    career (1961-62, 1964, 1978, 1986), Halpern, and his wife traveled to and
                    resided in various parts of the former Yugoslavia, where they studied Serbian
                    village folklife. In the mid-1950s, the Halperns also conducted fieldwork in
                    Laos, while visiting Thailand and Vietnam. At that time, Halpern was employed as
                    a Field Service Officer with the Community Development Division of USOM (the
                    American aid mission). He returned on research trips to Laos in 1959 and 1969.
                    Other research trips took him to Sweden, the Soviet Union, Greece, Israel,
                    India, Bulgaria, and Canada. Although he conducted research in various global
                    locations, the majority of the primary source materials in this collection was
                    gathered in Yugoslavia, Laos, and Canada.

    <p>
     Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern was born in 1931. She received her B.A. in
                    geography-geology from Barnard College in 1953, her M.A. in linguistics, and her
                    Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1979.
                    Initially, her career focused on socio-linguistics, though she later specialized
                    in medical anthropology. During her career, Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern has served
                    a research associate and adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts.
                    She has traveled and lectured in Australia, India, Pakistan, and Hungary among
                    other areas. In 1974, she conducted fieldwork among South Slavic Canadians in
                    Ontario under the auspices of the Canadian Museum of Civilization. Her research
                    was supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for
                    the Humanities.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    The Joel Martin Halpern Collection consists of photographs, slides, photocopies of
                photographs, photocopies of articles, audiotapes, videocassettes, published book
                materials, texts in native languages, manuscripts, reproductions of visual images,
                and ephemera related to his ethnographic field documentation undertaken from 1949 to
                2000 in Asia, Europe, and North America. The materials were assembled by Joel Martin
                Halpern, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Massachusetts,
                Amherst, and by his wife and colleague Barbara Kerewsky-Halpern. The Halperns
                conducted their fieldwork primarily from the 1950s to the 1990s, principally in the
                area of the former Yugoslavia, as well as in other areas of the Balkans. Their most
                intensive fieldwork was among the Serbs. In addition to this work, Joel Halpern
                conducted his own ethnographic research among Laotian, Vietnamese, and Inuit ethnic
                groups. The research materials in this collection emphasize historic aspects of folk
                culture. This includes documentation of material culture, such as architecture,
                agricultural implements, household utensils, and costume, as well as intellectual
                culture, such as music within the context of peasant tradition and village folk
                beliefs, and oral tradition in the setting of kinship structures and the structure
                of community social organization.
   </p>
   <p>
    Much of the primary source material of this collection consists of photographs of
                Balkan areas, especially Serbian and Bulgarian villages. There is also a series of
                sound recordings of music and interviews with Serbians and Bulgarians (see tape
                logs), as well as a collection of folklore programs recorded from Sofia radio, plus
                videocassettes of Bosnian and Serbian rural life. In addition there are interviews
                with Canadian Inuit people and tapes from the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation
                recorded from broadcasts in the Baffin Island area.
   </p>
   <p>
    Manuscript and photograph dates in the Container List usually refer to publication or
                photography dates; the collection contains many photocopies, with some
                originals.
