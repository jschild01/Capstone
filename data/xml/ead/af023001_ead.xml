    Processing History
   </head>
   <p>
    Physical materials in the Redwood Canyon Ramblers collection were processed by
                Marcia K. Segal from 2013-2023. Library of Congress staff digitized the
                videocassettes in 2017.
   </p>
   <p>
    Digital content from DVDs was ripped by AFC staff in 2013 and the carriers
                deaccessioned. Files from the DVDs and a separate file transfer were processed by
                Farrah Cundiff in 2024 into an archival information package (AIP): afc2011011_dc001.
                Derivatives created by the donor were retained. System files were removed. Some
                content which corresponded to physical source recordings in the

                in that collection. Otherwise, folder directories arranged by the donor were

    Many recordings in the Redwood Canyon Ramblers collection exist in both analog and
                digitized formats. Digitized versions were created by donor Brian Miksis as part of
                his "Redwood Canyon Ramblers Archive" digital project. Miksis edited them to enhance
                quality, and he created derivatives: Video files are available in Final Cut Pro
                output (mov) and DVD disk image (img) versions. Audio files are available in
                high-resolution (aif or wav), medium-resolution CD pre-tagged (aif), and
                low-resolution mp3 pre-tagged (mp3) versions. Analog, high-resolution digital audio,
                and FCP digital video are listed in detail throughout

     Neil V. Rosenberg
    </head>
    <p>
     Neil V. Rosenberg (born 1939, in Seattle, Washington), grew up in Olympia,
                    Washington, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Berkeley, California. From age seven he
                    studied violin, and later studied guitar and voice. His studies at Oberlin
                    College (where he earned a B.A. in history) overlapped with his time as
                    co-founder of the Redwood Canyon Ramblers. After graduation from Oberlin he
                    attended Indiana University (where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
                    folklore). Throughout this time he remained active as a musician and, with the
                    banjo as his primary musical instrument, he played at the Brown County Jamboree
                    in the early 1960s. His writing career from the mid-1960s has focused on
                    bluegrass music history, and he has written critically acclaimed books including
     <title>

     (1985; revised 2005),

      <part>
       Bluegrass Generation: A Memoir
      </part>
     </title>
     (2018), as well as album liner notes and scholarly articles. His
                    teaching career includes work at Indiana University (1966-1968) and Memorial
                    University of Newfoundland (1968-2004). In Canada, as in the U.S., Rosenberg
                    developed, founded, and mentored various musical endeavors: co-founder of the
                    bluegrass band Crooked Stovepipe; host of a weekly bluegrass music show
                    (broadcast on radio station CKIX-FM (St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador,
                    Canada); and numerous other achievements that served to draw and maintain a
                    lively interest in the genre and history of bluegrass music. In 2014, he was
                    inducted into the Bluegrass Hall of Fame.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    Collection of audio and video studio recordings, demo/audition tapes, live
                recordings at various clubs, coffeehouses, and auditoriums; jam sessions; and radio
                programs featuring the Redwood Canyon Ramblers, including a show from Radio Kansai,
                Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (1991).
   </p>
   <p>
    The audio and video event recordings are on 18 analog recording tapes and over 59
                digitized recordings. Analog recordings were collected by Neil Rosenberg. Digitized
                recordings were created by Brian Miksis from various source tapes. He cleaned,
                edited, and cut recordings into tracks, and he assembled them with digitized
                photographs and documentation as the "Redwood Canyon Ramblers Archive." The video
                files are available in Final Cut Pro output (mov) and DVD disk image (img) versions.
                The audio files are available in high-resolution (aif or wav), medium-resolution CD
                pre-tagged (aif), and low-resolution mp3 pre-tagged (mp3) versions.

    Materials acquired in accruals sometimes duplicate materials in the original
                acquisition. Each recording session has been assigned an "Event ID" under which all
                recording versions of the same event are grouped, with related documentation. Events
                are arranged chronologically.

                            documentation that accompanied the recordings, his own research,
                            observations while digitizing the recordings, and guidance from Neil
                            Rosenberg (e.g., when the pitch needed adjustment to restore the audio
                            quality). This document includes the names of the musicians, instruments
                            played, the source recording history, the name and address of the
                            recording location, and technical metadata regarding digitization.

        Recorded live on Radio Kansai, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. 10:15-11:30 AM.
                                MCs: The Saijo twins. Music by members of the Redwood Canyon
                                Ramblers (Mayne Smith, Neil Rosenberg, Ed Neff). Talk: Toru Mitsui.
                                The MCs talk over the intro and at various points during the songs
                                played. Songs, interview segments, and commercials are interspersed.
                                Most of the interview is in Japanese, with some parts in
                                English.

        Archivist's note: While AFC has the source tape, digital files made
                                by LC from the source tape, and the digital files received from
                                Brian Miksis, the elapsed times were used rather than real-time
                                markers. See

        Only the first part of the recording has both audio and video; the
