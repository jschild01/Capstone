     Ken Lindsay (1923-2001)
    </emph>
    was a founding
		partner in the Challenge Jazz Club, the first sizable jazz club in London after
		World War II. As a jazz and folk enthusiast, Lindsay was connected with the
		jazz revival and folk movement of the 1950s in the United Kingdom, and made a
		career of promoting such musicians and organizing performances. Lindsay also
		worked for the International Bookshop where he oversaw the department that
		would import records from America and Europe and sell them by mail. This was
		the period during which he established a correspondence relationship with Woody
		Guthrie. Lindsay went on to work for other record shops and continued to manage
		bands, lecture on music at universities, and write articles for such music
		publications as
    <title>

      Melody Maker
     </part>
    </title>
    and

    <emph render="bold">
     Woodrow Wilson "Woody" Guthrie
		  (1912-1967)
    </emph>
    was a singer, songwriter, and social activist who
		influenced twentieth-century American music and culture. Having lived through
		the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl Migration, World War II, and the political
		upheavals that resulted in the labor union movement, Guthrie called upon these
		experiences as he expressed the plight of common people through his songs,
		prose, and poetry. He was a seminal figure in the folk music revival of the
		1950s, and his songs and philosophy had a profound impact on society and on
		contemporary musicians such as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.

    Scope and Content
   </head>
   <p>
    The correspondence between Ken Lindsay and Woody Guthrie began in
            1952, while Lindsay was responsible for the mail order record department at the
            International Bookshop on Charing Cross Road in London, England. Lindsay first
            wrote to Guthrie encouraging him to write and record material for the European
            market. Although the recording projects and the European tours discussed in
            their letters never materialized, this correspondence (1952-1953) captures the
            development of a special relationship between two men who never met, but shared
            a passion for music. The correspondence also provides a glimpse at the creative
            flair and the personal challenges that shaped this period of Guthrie's
            life.
   </p>
   <p>
    In his letters to Lindsay, Guthrie discusses music, politics, and
            family relationships and reveals his struggle with alcoholism and the disease
            that claimed his life, Huntington's chorea. The letters also document
            Guthrie's whereabouts during these years as he writes from Brooklyn, New
            York; Jacksonville, Florida; and Topanga, California. Additionally, there is
            correspondence from Guthrie's second and third wives, Marjorie Mazia Guthrie
            and Anneke Van Kirk, who communicate details about Guthrie's personal health
            and professional endeavors to Lindsay. Letters MS01, MS03, MS04, and MS24 are
            even embellished with sketches made by Guthrie and Anneke Van Kirk.
   </p>
   <p>
    Interestingly, Guthrie concluded many of his letters with the number
            "30." This symbol is often found at the closing of a press release and is
            believed to have descended from the practice of typing "XXX" at the
            conclusion of telegraph transmissions during the Civil War.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are fifteen letters written by Ken Lindsay, seven written by
            Woody Guthrie, two written by Marjorie Guthrie (Guthrie's second wife), and
            two written by Anneke Van Kirk (Guthrie's third wife). In addition to the
            letters, there are four pages of song lyrics written by Woody Guthrie that he
            sent to Ken Lindsay with his letters. Some of the letters and song lyrics are
            embellished with drawings. The letters written by Ken Lindsay are carbon copies
            that Lindsay kept of his original letters.

    Arrangement
   </head>
   <p>
    The letters are arranged in chronological order to represent the
		  development of communication between Ken Lindsay and Woody Guthrie. Each letter was
		  assigned a unique manuscript (MS) number and the recto and verso of the
		  letter's leaves were assigned decimal derivations of that unique manuscript
		  number. For example, in the number "MS01.02," "MS01" represents the first item
		  of correspondence in the collection and ".02" signifies the verso of the first
		  leaf of the item. Decimal derivations were not assigned if the side of an item
		  is blank.
