When Professor Barrett Wendell agreed for me to prepare a term theme, I at once began to plan the best means of increasing my stock of cowboy songs. At once the idea of eventually issuing a book of these songs occurred to me. I, therefore, prepared the letter which follows, secured the endorsement of Professors Wendell and Kittredge, and mailed it to the editors of a thousand newspapers in the West.

"67 Oxford Street,
Cambridge, Mass. April 12, 1907

To the Editor:
I am a member of the English faculty of the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College on leave of absence for a year, which I am spending in the Graduate School of Harvard University. As part of my work I am endeavoring to make a complete collection of the native ballads and songs of the West. It will hardly be possible to secure such a collection except through the aid of the press: for many of these ballads have never been in print, but, like the Masonic Ritual, are handed down from one generation to another by "word of mouth." They deal mainly with frontier experiences: the deeds of desperadoes like Jesse James and Sam Bass; the life of the ranger and the cowboy; the trials of the Forty-niners, buffalo hunters, stage drivers, and freighters going up the trail, - in short, they are attempts, often crude and sometimes vulgar, to epitomize and particularize the life of the pioneers who peopled the vast region west of the Mississippi river.
