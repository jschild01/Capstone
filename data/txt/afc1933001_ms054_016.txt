Dear Mr, Waters:
   Please reply to the enclosed letter, or, as it is official, 
hand it over to Mr. Spivacke.
   The Cowboy Songs must be selling some or else there
would be no special circular.  I thought you would be interested
in some of the comments on the music.  Not an unfavorable line
yet.
   Did the children get my Christmas verses?   I pictured you reading
them aloud on Christmas morning.
   Maybe I'll be looking in on you in a few months or so.
  In the next edition of Cowboy Songs (to come soon) I am insisting
that your name come on the title page as music editor.  You might
send to Miss Susan R-----at Macmillans just the form you wish printed.
   Fishing here is the best in the world.  My average for an afternoon -
40 pounds.
   With my very kindest regards to the Waters' clan, in toto, believe me
always.
                                                           Sincerely yours,
                                                              John A, Lomax
