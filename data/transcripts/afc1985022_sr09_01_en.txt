[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000] He thinks he was picked up by a flying saucer one.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000] So this trapper right here lives in Crown Point and the other one lives in Tar Paper.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000] Yeah, now the one that lives in Tar Paper traps way up in the upper end.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000] What kind of boats do they use? Do they use a motor boat?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000] They'll bring a boat like this out and then they'll either walk their trap line or use a little P-Row to go out through there.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000] How do they set their traps? How many traps are they likely to have in a line and what is the...
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000] What are the...
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000] What are the sets like and stuff that they have to do?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000] They'll set it along the edge of the water.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000] Either attached to one of the wax myrtles or they'll drive a pole.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000] And they set them where we saw, like I showed you where the nutrias come in and out.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000] That's where they'll set them.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000] Do they use like any big circular set or anything like that?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000] No, most of them will just set right along the edge of your tenosyth to go.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000] One hundred and fifty traps is not uncommon.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000] Boy, that's a big bird.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000] It's a red-shoulder hawk.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000] It's beautiful.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000] Kingfisher.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000] Right.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000] It's got a big fin.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000] It's got a big fin.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000] Yeah.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000] It's got a big fin.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000] It's got a big fin.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000] It's a big fin.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000] It's an obviously big fin.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000] That's fresh.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000] A full cap.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000] A full cap.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000] Come on.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000] What a coolakin one.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000] It's a big fin.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000] ر
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.000] whoa, we're going in the wind.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000] Only a cold monday.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000] Solo or just me?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.340] up a little I think we're going right
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680] got my mommy to give me all bundled up for the bus
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:05.380] oh yeah this is where you had your fences up yeah that's where my fence is
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.820] another experiment hey watch out now that's science at work where I put that
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.320] erosion fence in it was supposed to kill all the wave action you look in the
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.960] trees you find look at the gray blue hair
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.140] oh they got some more red fourteen
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.800] the launches on Easter's meadow
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.240] never got to the brawl
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.740] came on
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.200] see the post with my fence still out in the water
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.760] see the post out in the lake
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.720] i had a
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.720] That's a fairly narrow strip, isn't it?
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.960] It's now less than 20 feet.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.480] When I came here it was over 40 plus marks on the other side.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.480] Really?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480] Yeah.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480] It really ate it up.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.960] We own that, right?
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.480] No, this is LL&E land.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.480] We have not purchased this yet.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480] Okay.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.960] What, that little strip there?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.720] Well, this whole, we don't know any of this in here.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.720] Now what's the impact of that?
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.720] Well, if it breaks through then it's going to start over here.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720] And the core probably won't dredge this.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720] Oh.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720] It's not seen yet, is it?
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720] It's not seen yet, right.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720] And it is going to break through.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720] Oh yeah, no question about it.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720] It's all the way through now.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720] See all this, how high it is?
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.620] They took that piece of marsh and tore it up and then laid it on a line like this.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.620] It's almost two feet higher.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.620] It's kind of neat.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.620] How long is it going to take?
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.620] I don't know.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.620] I don't know.
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620] I don't know.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.620] I don't know.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.620] We could sell you a piece of this.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.620] This year.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.620] I think it will.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.620] I think it will breach it this year.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.620] I think it's winning.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.620] What's that going to do to like the fishing and everything else?
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.620] I don't think it will hurt.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.620] It shouldn't hurt as much.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.620] No, it won't hurt a thing.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.620] The lake's the same.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.440] I've got pictures during, when we came in here right after the hurricane.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.620] We almost made it across the top of that in this boat.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.620] Right, right.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620] Yeah.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.620] Yeah.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.620] Yeah.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.620] Yeah.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.620] Yeah.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:26.620] These are Chinese tallow trees, which is an exotic, which if we followed our real true
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.620] cause, we would attempt to get rid of them, because it's an exotic.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620] However, it's the only thing holding these levees together.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.620] Is that why it was put there in the first place?
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.620] No, they grew there because when they drug this out, the little high elevations, we got
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.620] a little community there.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.620] But who planted them there in the first place?
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.620] Nobody.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.620] They're natural plants.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.620] It's a seed distribution.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:06:00.800] You tell you newer levees from the older ones, the older ones have wax myrtles, oaks, and
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.620] maples and things like that.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.620] The tallow trees are almost all of the newer.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.620] Why are they tallow trees?
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.620] Do they have some sort of like waxy substance on them or something?
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620] It's just imported.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.620] It's just imported landscape tree that's just adaptable, extremely adaptable.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.620] They come from China?
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.620] It grows fast, yeah.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.620] Yes.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620] I don't know if they actually are.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.620] They're called Chinese tallow.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.620] I assume they're from Southeast Asia.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.620] We'll go see if we can find those duck hunters and talk to them.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.620] Yeah.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.620] Yeah.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620] Yeah.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.620] Yeah.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620] Yeah.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620] Yeah.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620] Yeah.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620] Yeah.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620] Yeah.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.620] Yeah.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.620] Yeah.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.620] Yeah.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620] Yeah.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.620] Yeah.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.620] Yeah.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.620] Yeah.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620] Yeah.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620] Yeah.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.620] Yeah.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620] Yeah.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620] Yeah.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620] Yeah.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620] Yeah.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.620] Yeah.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.620] Yeah.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.620] Yeah.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.620] Yeah.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.620] Yeah.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.620] I don't know.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.620] It's just some old tree that's been growing all these years.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.620] That's what you call it now.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.620] Okay.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.620] All right.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620] So where'd you go?
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620] Get the duck in there.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620] All right.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620] Here I go.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.620] Yeah.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.620] All right.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.620] Get the duck in there.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.620] Get it.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.620] Yeah.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.620] Yeah.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.620] Here we have up there, wine.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.620] All right.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.620] That's a good idea.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.620] I found, I took a picture of it, I can't find the roll of film.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.620] I've done something with it.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.620] One of the markers, it's about this big, it says 49 on it.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.620] If you go out in the lake, there's a channel marked with these great big signs.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.620] One of them is back there.
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.620] It's as big as the front of this boat.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.620] Were you thinking of storm brought it in?
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.620] I'm sure it did.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.620] I thought it was kind of funny.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.620] I found it over there the other day.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.620] You're mad.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.620] It is that.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.620] I know, it's a cat.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.620] It looks terrific.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.620] That's been fairly warm.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.620] I've never worn these things.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.620] They are pretty warm.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.620] No, it's really great.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.620] I have one for the Dallas Cowboys and one for the Miami Dolphins.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.620] And one for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.620] But I don't know what I'd do with it.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.620] Yeah.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.620] I like them too.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.620] I would probably get a little more stuff.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.620] I just want it to flow in the tank.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.620] Yeah.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.620] I have a couple of my own.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.620] All I have is my dad's redskins.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.620] Yeah.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.620] The duck hunters are back at their boat.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.620] Where?
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.620] Right here.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620] What is that?
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.620] Look, the little pond where the birds are.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.620] Are those ponds all natural?
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.620] Yeah.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:01.620] You can't see them but there is one of our transit lines.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.620] It's right there.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.620] You can see one of the white poles right there.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.620] Oh, a water through the pool.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.620] There it is.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620] Look at that boat!
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:22.620] No, this is one of the oil wells.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.760] See the tree line ahead of us in the dark?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.620] That's the pipeline where we just were.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.620] All we've done is come down and come back up.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:39.620] These are the guys that are hunting in that series of cars.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.620] She's laughing with you, so laugh, you fool.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.620] Oh, that's good.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.620] That's really good.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.620] Put the glasses on the outside.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:14.620] The incredible invisible man.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.620] That's ethnic.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.620] You're going to be able to get some pictures.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.620] They're loading up.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.620] They're getting their P-Row and their vote.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.620] Yeah.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.620] We have your arm.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.620] Is this ours?
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.620] Yes, we own this.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.620] Let'süggeriyoruz today.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:11.620] We listen to our supervisor.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.620] So a little revelation all of us hear.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.620] You sound better now.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.620] Do I?
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.620] Don't be a louty cat.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.620] We haven't even Arkham to dig people yet.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.620] They'll take care of me.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.620] ем
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:30.600] Thank you.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.860] I don't know.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.280] I'm hoping he'll shoot you first.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.440] What's this little thing here?
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.400] It's an oil well.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.320] It's capped off.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.620] How lucky you are.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.940] Do you see anything?
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.680] Can I take your picture?
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:38.160] No luck.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.980] They were duck hunting?
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980] We had no luck.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.580] You don't have any.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.100] You don't have any
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.620] board race hunting volleys.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.540] You do? You could come out here.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.540] We do.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.800] We're leaving them on.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.560] They were hunting out in there.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.880] They were hunting out in there.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.400] So, I mean, are you the warden
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.920] or is there another person who's like you?
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.760] There's a whole bunch of killers out here.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.720] I just come out here and fool around.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.380] Tom's a killer.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.200] He's a killer card.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.060] He may not look like it, but he is.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.460] If he doesn't look like it.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.220] You're not that convincing.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.700] I want to show you something.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.800] You see that big piece of material right there?
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.380] You know where that came from?
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.060] The edge of the lake.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.900] That's what got torn up by the hurricane.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.740] Big pieces of marsh like that.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.300] That right there?
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.300] It got transported all the way down here.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.720] Is that a locust?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.460] Yeah.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:57.940] Is that a locust?
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.600] Yep.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:07.180] That's a tallow tree.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.600] What's a tallow tree?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.200] A tallow tree.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.120] Popcorn tree.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.700] They call it that?
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.080] Yeah, it looks like popcorn, doesn't it?
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.440] Yeah.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.320] Yeah.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.600] What's that going on?
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.260] I'm checking these guys for...
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.860] I would if y'all weren't with me.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.300] Would you?
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:34.640] Sure.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.000] For what?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.960] Duck stamps and all that shit?
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.680] Yeah, damn right.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.240] Huh?
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.280] Plugs and guns?
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:38.780] The whole thing?
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.380] You can if you want to.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.380] I don't mind.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.380] No, I don't want to do it with y'all with me.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.380] It's not a good idea.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920] You can do it.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.340] Yeah, we'll just sit back and eat
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.440] and I'll tell you more if there's anything.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.940] Ha!
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:00.440] Ha!
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.020] I'm glad you got out of the car.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.200] I'm glad you got out of the car.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.160] But I was out here,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.300] Lambert and I were out here.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.020] Barajas.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.300] I came one Sunday with them.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:07.940] We came up through
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.060] and we found a Piro sitting over here.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.540] So we checked all out here
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.740] and when we came back it was gone.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.960] We hadn't seen anybody.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.740] So I said, okay, pull over here and let me off,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.460] and I went trudging out to find him.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.400] By the time I got about halfway up here,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.020] he came out and started paddling away.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.300] So we came up to him,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.280] he had a 12 gauge,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.260] one of those old Ted Williams, 12 gauge,
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:37.160] gauge which was a fine gun when they first made them no trigger guard do you
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.800] imagine hunting with a gun with no trigger guard well no he had a plug in
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.680] it because we checked it
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.320] walking out through there oh yeah I said don't think you ought to get a trigger
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.540] dark well he said I tried but I can't find a part for him I said you ought to
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.220] get somebody to make you one you're gonna shoot yourself
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.640] absolutely this is perfectly legal place to hunt
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.340] it has to have that well we've changed all the rules now where it doesn't say
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.620] that you know used to say
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.780] it was prohibited in National Historical Park National Park in
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.040] historical park go change 36 CFR's accommodate
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.760] why aren't all亟 сю�er outside loves thebones for ducks and situations like loves the habitat for shrouds nothing for him to eat, plus water level goes up very quickly, that'sción u toucha cá Luoma p Bears, la caña de la caña senior.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.740] Uhooo.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.860] happy you jacket your're reasonable to eat.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.940] water level goes up and down so much they won't stay out there in those ponds.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.300] Those ponds are the fishing hole.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.100] We gotta get the water back up again.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.100] Next time it gets up we're gonna come fish, fly fish those ponds.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.100] Fly fishing?
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.100] Oh yeah, I love fly fishing.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.100] What would they get in there?
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.100] Bass, perch.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.100] Crappie, one whole.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100] Sunfish.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:29.100] Oh, one of the best places to crappie fish is right there around that dry hole.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.100] Oh yeah.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:35.060] I sat here and talked to the guys last spring I think.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.060] They were sitting there catching them as fast as.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:47.060] Could have been that.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.060] That looks like it.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.060] That probably is you guys.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.060] We've gone back in a time warp.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.060] That's the plane.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.060] That looks like the plane.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.060] Had pontoons?
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.060] Yeah.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.060] Amphib is they called.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.060] Took off on the ground and landed in the water?
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.060] We didn't land in any water.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.060] They just had the pontoon.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.060] He said he wasn't qualified yet, didn't he?
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.060] Didn't he say he had 25 hours of water landing and he needed 50 or something?
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.060] Yeah.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.060] He said he was qualified.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.060] Those guys who west we go do that.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.060] They take off on the land and then they land in the water.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.060] He was qualified or else he wouldn't be able to fly.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.060] Well, that's what I was wondering.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060] He shouldn't have been able to.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.060] Oh, that's right.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.060] It was helicoptered for him.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:48.060] Yeah.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.060] Helicopter requires something ridiculous.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.060] Yeah.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:20:01.060] You know, like a plane requires 40 hours, I think, and a helicopter requires about 200
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060] hours.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.060] You know, landed on the water, I mean, kind of feeling you get landing on the water.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.060] Probably the same thing.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.060] Deceleration's a lot quicker.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.060] Yeah.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.060] We own a this.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.060] We own a this.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060] We own a this.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.060] We own a this.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.060] We own a this.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.060] We own a this.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.060] We own a this.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.060] We own a this.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060] We own a this.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.060] We own a this.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.060] We own a this...
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.060] You know, nothing smaller.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.060] We own the big deal.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.060] So a little behind, only me.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.060] I'm getting Pron talked about a bunch of content Ouais, I've been comfortable,
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.060] it's called Propaganda.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.060] It's hundreds and hundreds!
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.060] Ha, I've quite got your fear, do as I like to get around here.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:38.120] And once you both get to that bank,
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:46.060] It's gonna be nonsense!
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.060] Whatever, right?
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.060] Get out there, bro.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:56.060] keel
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.380] 14 short miles
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.380] really? 14 miles from here?
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.380] there won't be anything left for some of us
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.380] including the driver
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.380] now this is another dry hole that they went out and dug
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.380] this is one that's broken through
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.380] I'll show you a typical example of what this looks like now
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.380] what lake is that on the other side?
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.380] that's Lake Salvador
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.380] that's Lake San Pedro
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.380] see these big chunks are all back in here too
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.380] was Hurricane Juan that did that?
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.380] jeez
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:17.380] brrrr
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.380] careful
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:23:11.380] 
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.380] I'm not sure if you can see them
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.380] yeah they're around
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.380] did they um
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.380] did the hurricane ever kill any of them?
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.380] oh yeah a lot of them drowned
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.380] but see here they were close enough they could get into the higher ridges
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.380] but see how it just took all this and picked it up and brought it back in here
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.380] and laid it on top of it?
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.380] see that sign?
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.380] when we did our
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.380] two years ago when Tommy and I put out the transits
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.380] that sign was on the shore
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:53.380] we saw it
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.380] yeah that one was about 30 feet deep
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.380] it ripped it man
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.380] oh yeah this will grow we'll get growth
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.380] this is starting to grow up
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.380] yeah
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.380] but it
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.380] it's not floating is it?
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.380] no no
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.380] but it's very vulnerable now
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.380] to Tranos all the way through there now.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.380] Oh, that's through here?
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.380] Yeah.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.380] A couple good January, February, I think this will be gone.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.380] It'll actually break through.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.380] You say January and February.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.380] That's when we had those winter fronts come through.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.380] We get tremendous northwest wind.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.380] That's when it really tears it up.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.380] It wasn't like when it was last year, was it?
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.380] No, last year it wasn't all that bad.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.380] We only had a couple.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.380] See, here's the casing for the oil.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.380] It's always nice to hit one of those in the boat, too.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.380] Going for the lake.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:22.380] It's a Rambo glove.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.380] It's got his name in it.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.380] This was a cemetery.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.380] They dug right through the middle of it.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.380] The local people that lived out here, it was their cemetery.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.380] Were they upset when they did it?
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380] Yeah.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.380] Yeah, but they, oil companies don't care.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.380] They did it anyway.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.380] Did they just turn it under?
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.380] No, they just dug it up and threw it out.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.380] Would they have done that if it was an Indian cemetery?
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.380] No, but back then they could because there were very few restrictions back then.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.380] How long ago was it?
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.380] The 50s, early 60s.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.380] That was before the Indian Religious Freedom Act was discussed.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.380] Yeah.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.380] Isn't that how they do it?
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.380] Apparently back then it really wasn't.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.380] Now, I would assume there must have been some law that you could do that.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.380] I'm sure there'll be somewhere.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.380] That's terrible.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.380] Evidently, the local people that lived out here were very upset about it, but it didn't
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380] do them any good.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:19.380] By the way, I understand though, if you own an Indian mound or something that's on your
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.380] land, you can tear it up, can't you?
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.380] I don't know.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.380] I think it's illegal to disturb any archeological remains, not to record them, because developers,
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.380] they may have done that, but it's illegal.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.380] It's illegal.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.380] It's illegal.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.380] It's illegal.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.380] I don't know.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380] I think it's illegal.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:41.380] They may own the land, but they get a permit.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.380] But to develop, they don't with the understanding that they have to report it.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.380] They probably don't report it.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.380] There's some federal funds involved with the project.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.380] I don't know.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.380] I think that's true.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.380] I think if I buy some land, then I can do anything I want to do.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.380] Really?
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.380] But if I'm, it might be worth it.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.380] I don't know what it is.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.380] There's federal funds.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380] Say if I've got enough H.A. grants, I'm gonna pay it.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.380] I can do whatever I want to do.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.380] Okay.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.380] Then it's legal to do this.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.380] It's legal to do this.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.380] I think it's illegal to do this.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.380] It's illegal to do this.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.380] I'm not sure.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.380] I don't know.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.380] I think it's illegal to do this.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:16.380] For an FHA loan even, on a house, a property, conceivably the FHA loan would prohibit him from doing certain things at a...
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.380] Huh.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:27.380] This guy out in Vermillion Parish has got a couple Indian pounds on his property. He wants to sell the shell off a rope for it.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.380] Huh.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:34.380] And then some people try to stop him, and I told them I wouldn't know of any rules that could stop these houses.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.380] Then the property names the state said they couldn't stop them.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.380] Oh. Maybe.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:50.380] Yeah, there was some archaeological conservancy or something in Washington that was trying to prevent or at least have it surveyed before he sells it.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.380] So this is Lake Salvador?
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.380] Yes.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380] There's a lot of fish jumping.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.380] Oh yeah. It's a very highly productive area.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.380] Are they? What kind of fish are they?
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.380] Mollet.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.380] Mollet.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.380] Could be mullet, could be bass, could be trout.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.380] Aren't they jumping all over the place? We should have brought them. It would be fun to catch them.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.380] Isn't this part of an old mound?
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.380] Yes, this is.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.380] What's left? It's a shell bin.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.380] Now, you see that tree right there? It's out in the water? When I came here, that tree was on the shore.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.380] What's a shell bin?
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.380] When George came here, the Indians were still making shells.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.380] That's right. That's true. I forgot.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.380] Yeah.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380] What are they?
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.380] What are they?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.380] What are they?
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.380] Probably, maybe, probably trout.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.380] Trout?
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.380] Little trout?
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.380] Yeah.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:45.380] Now, do they oil out in Lake Salvador?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.380] Do what?
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.380] Do they have oil out here? That's what that is there.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.380] That's Chevron.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.380] Oh boy.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.380] What a fun day.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.380] Well, George and the little boat on a windy day across Lake Salvador.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.380] Boom.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380] Boom.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.380] Oh, boy.
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.380] In a canoe.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.380] No, no, no, no.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.380] Oh, I'd be easier in a canoe.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.380] No, no, no, no.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.380] No, this is a big god damn lake.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.380] Take the water sample out here?
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.380] No, it's down in the bottom of the lake.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.380] Man, if I were anywhere else in this country, I'd be in a ditch right now.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.380] We could do it anywhere in the world.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.380] No, it's down in the bottom of the lake.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.380] Wow.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.380] Man, if I were anywhere else in this country, I'd be in a ditch right now.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.380] Yeah.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.380] and if I were anywhere else in this country,
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.280] I'd say it's gonna snow.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.160] Yeah, well it looks snow.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.560] It's gray.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.420] Well the other day, it really looked like
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.420] it was gonna snow.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.000] You know, Dave Barnes said that night,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.300] he said, you know, with any luck,
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.440] he said, Baton Rouge may get a few flurries.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.960] It didn't happen, he said.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.000] What day was it?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.640] It got snow on Shreveport, right?
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.000] Was that gone? Really, right now?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.500] What, a week ago, or last Friday?
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.800] Last Friday when it got cold.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.040] It really looked like it was gonna snow.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040] It's a small Shreveport, though.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.980] Yeah, it was, right.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.040] Both my kids came home and said,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.420] boy, it looks like it's gonna snow.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.840] Yeah, but here, when the clouds come in,
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.580] it warms up, and when the clouds go away,
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.520] it cools off, you can't get that.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.960] This was an Indian midden.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.260] Lot of pieces of pottery along the shoreline.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.800] Who lives there?
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.740] Those were camps, hunting camps.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740] Seahawks, right?
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.640] No, no.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640] We do not own them.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.180] No, we do not own this yet.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.680] Are we looking at them?
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.180] Yeah, but the guy don't sell.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.180] Oh.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.620] At least his hands have them.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.820] One of them was occupied.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.820] The one with the green front, I think, is occupied now.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.800] I don't know how close in the shore we can get.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.960] It is so shallow.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.840] We'll get in as close as we can.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.580] Then you have to walk in.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.940] Okay.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.320] You didn't wear your bathing suit.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.580] I forgot.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.980] You wore your bathing suit that whole time.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.420] No, no.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.320] That's probably you.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.680] I couldn't fit an eye in over all these clothes.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.220] You can walk in and start a fire real quick,
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.560] and then we'll be able to get through.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.000] We'll go over and walk in on their dock.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.700] Directly. We'll have our picnic there.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.140] All I can do is tell us to get off their dock.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.540] Did you get a picture of the camp?
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.000] Tom, do you have...
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.880] Yeah.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.980] Is this tar paper?
